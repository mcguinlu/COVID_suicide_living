55,The effects of COVID-19 lockdown on lifestyle and emotional state in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology: Results of an Italian survey,"Purpose On March 8, 2020, the Italian Government implemented extraordinary measures to limit viral transmission of COV-19/SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on lifestyle and emotional state in women planning infertility treatments. Basic Procedures We performed a quantitative research study using a web-based survey, in 140 women referred to Assisted Reproductive Technologies Center. Main findings We observed changes in body weight during lockdown in 80 % of women, and a significant increase in BMI in comparison to that observed before (p=.001). We observed a high percentage of non-adherence to the Mediterranean pattern during lockdown due to higher frequency of consumption of sweet/pastries, cheese and meat, rather than fruit, vegetables and legumes. Before lockdown 36.4 % women were snack consumers while during lockdown 55 % (p=.002). By considering individuals’ attitude to snack consumption, we observed an increase related to boredom (p=<.0001) and anxiety (p=.05) during lockdown. Increased levels of anxiety and sadness were observed in about 30 %, and of boredom in 25 %. The percentage of women worried about their planning infertility treatment was more than 50 %.

58,"Younger people are more vulnerable to stress, anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic: A global cross-sectional survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-ranging consequences for general physical and mental health. Country-specific research reveals a general reduction in mental and physical well-being, due to measures undertaken to stop the spread of COVID-19 disease. However, research is yet to examine the impact of the pandemic on global psychological distress and its effects upon vulnerable groups. Exploration of the factors that potentially mediate the relationship between stress and mental health during this period is needed, to assist in undertaking concrete measures to mitigate psychological distress and support vulnerable groups. Therefore, this study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress globally, and identified factors that may exacerbate decline in mental health. N = 1653 participants (mean age 42.90 ± 13.63 years; 30.3% males) from 63 countries responded to the survey. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and State Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Other measures included the Perceived Stress Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Globally, consistently high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and poor sleep were observed regardless of number of COVID-19 cases. Over 70% of the respondents had greater than moderate levels of stress, with 59% meeting the criteria for clinically significant anxiety and 39% reporting moderate depressive symptoms. People with a prior mental health diagnosis experienced greater psychological distress. Poor sleep, lower levels of resilience, younger age and loneliness significantly mediated the links between stress and depression, and stress and anxiety. Age-based differences revealed that younger age-groups were more vulnerable to stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Results show that these vulnerable individuals need more support. Age-specific interventions for modifiable factors that mediate the psychological distress need to urgently deployed to address the global mental health pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110236,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110236,Scopus,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110236,2021-07-13,,,
59,Investigating how individual differences influence responses to the COVID-19 crisis: The role of maladaptive and five-factor personality traits,"Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic impacted both the physical and psychological aspects of people's lives. Personality traits are one of the factors that explain the diverse responses to stressful situations. This study aimed to investigate whether five-factor and maladaptive personality traits are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicide risk, self-reported COVID-19 symptoms, and preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, comprehensively. Methods We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of 1000 Koreans between May 8 to 13, 2020. Participants' five-factor and maladaptive personality traits were measured using the multidimensional personality inventory, the Bright and Dark Personality Inventory. COVID-19 symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicide risk, and preventive behaviors were also measured. Results The results revealed that maladaptive personality traits (e.g., negative affectivity, detachment) had positive correlations with depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicide risk, and COVID-19 symptoms, and the five-factor personality traits (e.g., agreeableness, conscientiousness) had positive correlations with preventive behaviors. Conclusion Our findings extend the current understanding of the relationship between five-factor and maladaptive personality traits and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Longitudinal follow-up should further investigate the influence of personality traits on an individual's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110786,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110786,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110786,2021-07-01,,,

61,"Climate change, environment pollution, COVID-19 pandemic and mental health","Converging data would indicate the existence of possible relationships between climate change, environmental pollution and epidemics/pandemics, such as the current one due to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each of these phenomena has been supposed to provoke detrimental effects on mental health. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to review the available scientific literature on these variables in order to suggest and comment on their eventual synergistic effects on mental health. The available literature report that climate change, air pollution and COVID-19 pandemic might influence mental health, with disturbances ranging from mild negative emotional responses to full-blown psychiatric conditions, specifically, anxiety and depression, stress/trauma-related disorders, and substance abuse. The most vulnerable groups include elderly, children, women, people with pre-existing health problems especially mental illnesses, subjects taking some types of medication including psychotropic drugs, individuals with low socio-economic status, and immigrants. It is evident that COVID-19 pandemic uncovers all the fragility and weakness of our ecosystem, and inability to protect ourselves from pollutants. Again, it underlines our faults and neglect towards disasters deriving from climate change or pollution, or the consequences of human activities irrespective of natural habitats and constantly increasing the probability of spillover of viruses from animals to humans. In conclusion, the psychological/psychiatric consequences of COVID-19 pandemic, that currently seem unavoidable, represent a sharp cue of our misconception and indifference towards the links between our behaviour and their influence on the “health” of our planet and of ourselves. It is time to move towards a deeper understanding of these relationships, not only for our survival, but for the maintenance of that balance among man, animals and environment at the basis of life in earth, otherwise there will be no future.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145182,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145182,Scopus,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145182,2021-06-15,,,
62,Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: The importance of the vagus nerve for biopsychosocial resilience,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread increases in mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. The development of these and other psychiatric disorders may be related to changes in immune, endocrine, autonomic, cognitive, and affective processes induced by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, many of these same changes can be triggered by psychosocial stressors such as social isolation and rejection, which have become increasingly common due to public policies aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The present review aims to shed light on these issues by describing how viral infections and stress affect mental health. First, we describe the multi-level mechanisms linking viral infection and life stress exposure with risk for psychopathology. Then, we summarize how resilience can be enhanced by targeting vagus nerve function by, for example, applying transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and targeting lifestyle factors, such as exercise. With these biopsychosocial insights in mind, researchers and healthcare professionals will be better equipped to reduce risk for psychopathology and increase resilience during this challenging pandemic period and beyond.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.02.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.02.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.02.010,2021-06-01,,,

65,Emotional eating during COVID-19 in the United Kingdom: Exploring the roles of alexithymia and emotion dysregulation,"Emotional eating, generally defined as (over)-eating in response to negative emotions, has been associated with poor physical and psychological outcomes. During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19.

In this study, we evaluated changing income, self-restraint, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress, and ego-resiliency, to investigate the main and moderating effects of ego-resiliency on psychological distress. We analyzed 222 Japanese samples from the dataset of Primary Survey in Japan (PSJ) in the Resilience to COVid-19 in Each Region (RE-COVER) project. The results showed significant main effects of ego-resiliency on depression and stress, and a significant interaction effect of self-restraint and ego-resiliency on depression. We also tested the significance of the moderating effect of ego-resiliency on the relationship between self-restraint and depression. The simple slope of ego-resiliency was only significant for individuals with high self-restraint. Our findings provide empirical evidence on mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among the Japanese population, proving that ego-resiliency functioned to cope with the specific stresses associated with COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110702,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110702,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110702,2021-06-01,,,

68,Predictors of emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic; a Croatian study,"The study aimed to assess relations between coronavirus-related psychological distress and its potentially predictive factors. An online sample of 2860 Croatian adults filled in questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics, distress (the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21), coping (the Brief COPE), personality (the International Personality Item Pool), and social support (the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire) during the COVID-19 lockdown and after the capital was hit by an earthquake. Results indicated that 15.9% of the respondents experienced severe to extreme depression, 10.7% severe to extreme anxiety, and 26.2% severe to extreme stress. The hierarchical regressions analysis indicated that the considered variables explained a substantial percentage of the variance in depression (51.4%), anxiety (35.2%), and stress (45.5%). Main predictors of emotional distress were lower scores of Emotional Stability, higher scores of Agreeableness, avoidant coping, lack of active coping and perceived social support. The negative effect of the earthquake was weak. Results provide information on a broad range of potentially protective or vulnerability factors that could help identify those at risk for developing coronavirus-related psychological distress.

69,Personality and motivational predictors of well-being and coping during COVID-19: A reversal theory analysis,"This study used reversal theory to examine motivational predictors of well-being and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. 149 UK based respondents completed an online survey including measures of demographics, well-being, coping, motivational style, and dominance. Well-being was predicted by optimism (positively), autic and mastery (negatively) dominances, by alloic sympathy, optimism and paratelic motivation styles (positively), and, negatively by arousal seeking, arousability and pessimism. Coping was positively predicted by optimism and negativism dominances and by negativist, paratelic and telic motivations, and, negatively by arousability and pessimism. Using motivational dominances, indirect support was identified for the link between psychodiversity and well-being, but not coping. Findings suggest that well-being and, to a lesser degree, coping could be enhanced by encouraging individuals to experience a range of motivations, possibly focusing on those identified here as significant predictors. Future research needs to determine the context specificity of these findings and explore psychodiversity, well-being and coping using both metamotivational states and composite profiles incorporating the full range of motivational constructs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110703,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110703,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110703,2021-06-01,,,

71,Machine learning techniques and older adults processing of online information and misinformation: A covid 19 study,"This study is informed by two research gaps. One, Artificial Intelligence's (AI's) Machine Learning (ML) techniques have the potential to help separate information and misinformation, but this capability has yet to be empirically verified in the context of COVID-19. Two, while older adults can be particularly susceptible to the virus as well as its online infodemic, their information processing behaviour amid the pandemic has not been understood. Therefore, this study explores and understands how ML techniques (Study 1), and humans, particularly older adults (Study 2), process the online infodemic regarding COVID-19 prevention and cure. Study 1 employed ML techniques to classify information and misinformation. They achieved a classification accuracy of 86.7% with the Decision Tree classifier, and 86.67% with the Convolutional Neural Network model. Study 2 then investigated older adults' information processing behaviour during the COVID-19 infodemic period using some of the posts from Study 1. Twenty older adults were interviewed. They were found to be more willing to trust traditional media rather than new media. They were often left confused about the veracity of online content related to COVID-19 prevention and cure. Overall, the paper breaks new ground by highlighting how humans' information processing differs from how algorithms operate. It offers fresh insights into how during a pandemic, older adults—a vulnerable demographic segment—interact with online information and misinformation. On the methodological front, the paper represents an intersection of two very disparate paradigms—ML techniques and interview data analyzed using thematic analysis and concepts drawn from grounded theory to enrich the scholarly understanding of human interaction with cutting-edge technologies.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106716,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106716,Scopus,10.1016/j.chb.2021.106716,2021-06-01,,,

It also aims to identify factors that have an impact on the mental health maintenance of young Americans. The conducted analyses are an attempt at explaining the influence of high psycho-social stress on the mental health of young people. Methods Secondary data from representative research conducted among the inhabitants of the United States of America on the sample of 10,139 respondents has been used in the analysis. The data is derived from the Pew Research Center, American Trends Panel. Results The data analysis indicates that among all the age categories the highest levels of mental discomfort have been observed among the youngest Americans aged 18–29. The majority of respondents experienced anxiety and depression. The results of analyses of the youngest respondents (sample n = 1083) have shown that there are a few factors which have impact on mental health of the young generation. Males, people living in relationships, practising religion more often, having a better financial situation, conservative beliefs and being devoid of citizenship had a better mental condition. Owned social, economic and cultural resources protect young Americans against the Covid-19 pandemic.

Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong's (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n = 154), Indian (n = 111), and Nepali (n = 149) university students studying in Australia in May–June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity.

Methods This is an ecological study of the COVID pandemic over ten weeks. The study examines the set of alcohol or other drug-dependent or dual disorder patients in the population of Salamanca, Spain. The measurements were: professionals; calls made; percentage of successful calls; face-to-face visits; first visits made; reviews made; techniques; injectable treatments; other treatments; evolution; relapses. The ODC includes about 375 new patients each year and another 650 other patients annually. Results The study found the number of relapses to be greater in the last five weeks of the 10-week study period. Patients' psychopathological instability also increased, and face-to-face visits were necessary. The most frequent psychopathology that required face-to-face intervention was depressive disorder. The number of interventions with patients increased. In parallel, social workers' efforts were greater after the seventh week. There was a decrease in response to calls. Throughout this time, the ODC attended to patients who needed to be treated for the first time. Conclusions Confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic generated maladaptive emotional responses and other behaviors, such as excessive alcohol consumption. The number of face-to-face consultations, admissions, and referrals to therapeutic communities increased. Patients under stress and in social isolation resorted more often to substance use. The ODC had to adopt a flexible approach to evaluate patients with more serious problems, by using face-to-face assessments.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108303,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108303,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108303,2021-06-01,,,

Aim of the study This work assessed the prevalence of self-medication with medicinal plants and the prevalence of the concomitant use of prescribed psychiatric drugs and medicinal plants for treating symptoms associated with anxiety and depression during the Covid-19 lockdown in Mexico. Materials and methods The suspected adverse reactions associated with drug-herb interactions were assessed. The factors associated with self-medication, the concomitant use of herb-drug combinations, and the presence of adverse reactions due their combined use is also reported. The study was descriptive and cross-sectional using an online questionnaire conducted among population with symptoms associated with anxiety and depression (n = 2100) from seven states of central-western Mexico. Results The prevalence of the use of herbs (61.9%) and the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations (25.3%) were associated with being diagnosed with mental illness [OR:2.195 (1.655–2.912)] and the use of psychiatric medications [OR:307.994 (178.609–531.107)], respectively. The presence of adverse reactions (n = 104) by the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations was associated with being unemployed [p = 0.004, OR: 3.017 (1.404–6.486)].

79,"Increased emotional eating during COVID-19 associated with lockdown, psychological and social distress","Due to the spread of COVID 2019, the Italian government imposed a lockdown on the national territory. Initially, citizens were required to stay at home and not to mix with others outside of their household (Phase 1); eventually, some of these restrictions were lifted (Phase 2). To investigate the impact of lockdown on emotional and binge eating, an online survey was conducted to compare measures of self-reported physical (BMI), psychological (Alexithymia), affective (anxiety, stress, and depression) and social (income, workload) state during Phase 1 and Phase 2. Data from 365 Italian residents showed that increased emotional eating was predicted by higher depression, anxiety, quality of personal relationships, and quality of life, while the increase of bingeing was predicted by higher stress. Moreover, we showed that higher alexithymia scores were associated by increased emotional eating and higher BMI scores were associated with both increased emotional eating and binge eating. Finally, we found that from Phase 1 to Phase 2 binge and emotional eating decreased. These data provide evidence of the negative effects of isolation and lockdown on emotional wellbeing, and, relatedly, on eating behaviour.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105122,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105122,Scopus,10.1016/j.appet.2021.105122,2021-05-01,,,
80,Telemedicine increases access to buprenorphine initiation during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Federal regulatory changes during the COVID-19 pandemic allow buprenorphine to be prescribed without an initial in-person evaluation. Prior to COVID-19, numerous barriers limited broad uptake of buprenorphine among people who use drugs at the system, provider, and patient levels, including lack of available DATA 2000 waivered clinicians to prescribe, stigma, and competing livelihood priorities. As two harm reduction primary care programs in New York State that care for people who use drugs and offer buprenorphine, one rural (Ithaca) and one urban (Manhattan), we have rapidly adopted telemedicine to initiate buprenorphine treatment. Our collective experience suggests that telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation is eliminating many traditional barriers to treatment, in particular for individuals leaving incarceration, and people who use drugs and access syringe service programs. Future models of buprenorphine treatment should incorporate telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation, which can be done in collaboration with community-based outreach and peer networks to engage people who use drugs. This regulatory change must be sustained beyond COVID-19, and is vital to increasing access to buprenorphine, closing the opioid use disorder treatment gap, and achieving greater health equity for people who use drugs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108272,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108272,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108272,2021-05-01,,,
81,Fear and anxiety in patients with multiple sclerosis during COVID-19 pandemic; report of an Iranian population,"Background There are reports that stress-related disorders are increasing during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which result in worsening of their disability. There are concerns about the mental health of MS patients during this pandemic. Objective We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and levels of fear about Corona in MS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study on MS patients who were admitted to the MS clinics affiliated with Isfahan University of medical sciences from May to June 2020. Anxiety and depression were evaluated according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Corona Fear Questionnaire developed by Ahorsu et al. was applied to evaluate the state of fear about COVID-19. Chi-square tests were used to compare depression and anxiety between different groups, Kruskal-Wallis was used for fear scores, Spearman correlation coefficient was also reported for correlations. Results 410 MS patients with a mean age of 38.6 years (±10.35) were enrolled in the study. Among those patients who answered the HADS questionnaire completely (n=399, n=388, for anxiety and depression subscales respectively) the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 31.2% (n=128) and 39.3% (n=161), respectively. There was no significant relationship between anxiety and depression with any of the following variables: sex, marital status, history of drug abuse, smoking, duration of taking psychiatric medication, being tested for COVID-19, being quarantined. Regarding fear about COVID-19, patients with depression or anxiety showed higher scores on the fear questionnaire (p-value=0.03, p-value=0.008 respectively). Conclusions The prevalence of anxiety and depression in MS patients was higher than previously reported. Fear about COVID-19 was correlated with anxiety and depression. Multicenter studies are required to develop specific recommendations for screening mental health problems in MS patients during COVID pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.102798,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.102798,Scopus,10.1016/j.msard.2021.102798,2021-05-01,,,
82,Isoprostanes in wastewater as biomarkers of oxidative stress during COVID-19 pandemic,"Isoprostanes are the potential biomarkers of endogenous human metabolism and proven clinically to provide the quantitative measure of systematic oxidative injury. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analytical method capable of determining four biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-iso-PGF2α, 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III, PGE2, and 5-iPF2α-VI) in wastewater was developed and validated. Isoprostanes were quantified in the range of 31.1–1270 ng/L in raw wastewater samples in two communities in western Kentucky and Tennessee during the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent detection of PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI in wastewater suggested that PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI can be a reliable biomarker of community oxidative anxiety. The higher 4-month average mass load of isoprostanes [(ranged from 22.9 mg/d/1000 people to 807 mg/d/1000 people] may be attributed to the elevated community level oxidative anxiety owing COVID-19 uncertainties. The average mass loads of PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI in a community were significantly increased (two-tailed p < 0.001) from the first month of COVID-19 pandemic to the second month; however, significantly decreased (two-tailed p < 0.001) in the third month. Wastewater-based-epidemiological determination of isoprostanes can be a near-real-time and cost-effective approach of a trend in community depression. This is the first report of the quantification of PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI in wastewater and estimation of the community level oxidative anxiety.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129489,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129489,Scopus,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129489,2021-05-01,,,
83,"Basketball jones: Fan passion, motives, and reactions to the suspension of the National Basketball Association season due to COVID-19","The suspension of the 2019–2020 National Basketball Association (NBA) season due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that NBA fans were unable to engage in an activity that they loved in the midst of a global health crisis. In this research, we assessed if fan responses to the suspension were associated with different types of fan passion and motives. Shortly after the NBA season suspension, NBA fans (N = 395) completed online surveys assessing harmonious and obsessive passion for being an NBA fan, motives for watching games, and various attitudes and responses to the suspension. We found that both fan passion and motives predicted responses to the suspension, particularly obsessive passion which predicted greater levels of distress, coping responses, and negative attitudes toward the suspension. These findings have implications for both the passion and fan motives literatures.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101885,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101885,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101885,2021-05-01,,,
84,A potential solution to avoid overdose of mixed drugs in the event of Covid-19: Nanomedicine at the heart of the Covid-19 pandemic,"Since 2020, the world is facing the first global pandemic of 21st century. Among all the solutions proposed to treat this new strain of coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, the vaccine seems a promising way but the delays are too long to be implemented quickly. In the emergency, a dual therapy has shown its effectiveness but has also provoked a set of debates around the dangerousness of a particular molecule, hydroxychloroquine. In particular, the doses to be delivered, according to the studies, were well beyond the acceptable doses to support the treatment without side effects. We propose here to use all the advantages of nanovectorization to address this question of concentration. Using quantum and classical simulations we will show in particular that drug transport on boron nitrogen oxide nanosheets increases the effectiveness of the action of these drugs. This will definitely allow to decrease the drug quantity needing to face the disease.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2021.107834,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2021.107834,Scopus,10.1016/j.jmgm.2021.107834,2021-05-01,,,
85,"Anxiety, depression and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a cross-sectional survey","Background Multiple survey studies have demonstrated a mental health (MH) burden of COVID-19 globally. However, few studies have examined relevant risk factors for pandemic-related MH issues. Methods A link to an online survey was posted from April 8th - June 11th, 2020 which included questions regarding COVID-19 experience, perceived impact of the pandemic on life domains (e.g., social communication, finances), behavioural alterations (e.g., online activities, substance use), and MH treatment history. Current psychiatric symptom severity and impairment were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Perceived Stress Scale. Results Overall, 632 individuals (82% female, mean age:42.04 ± 16.56) in Canada and the United States completed the survey. While few reported contracting COVID-19 (0.5%), the impact of the pandemic was evident, with a vast majority reporting anxiety around COVID-19 infecting loved ones (88%). Almost half (43%) reported previous MH treatment and 31% met criteria for GAD, 29% for MDD and 63% reported significantly high levels of stress. Female sex, younger age and past MH treatment emerged as significant predictors of these issues(p < .01). Age-related differences in the impact of COVID-19 on life domains, substance use, and online activity were also noted. Conclusion The findings from the current sample add to the growing literature suggesting negative effects of COVID-19 on MH, while highlighting specific risk factors.

We investigated whether making meaning in negative experiences (MINE) would help people cope with COVID-19. We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study (N = 2364) three months before, during, and after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Results showed that participants reported increased tendency of MINE during the COVID-19 outbreak than three months before the outbreak. Moreover, both initial MINE and the increased MINE predicted less psychological distress including depression, anxiety and stress, during and three months after the outbreak. Perceived benefits and costs of the COVID-19 mediated the long-term effect of MINE. These findings not only provide novel evidence for meaning making model but also shed light on the underlying mechanism, suggesting an effective strategy to cope with stressful events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110670,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110670,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110670,2021-05-01,,,
87,Mining topic and sentiment dynamics in physician rating websites during the early wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: Machine learning approach,"Introduction An increasing number of patients are voicing their opinions and expectations about the quality of care in online forums and on physician rating websites (PRWs). This paper analyzes patient online reviews (PORs) to identify emerging and fading topics and sentiment trends in PRWs during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods Text data were collected, including 55,612 PORs of 3430 doctors from three popular PRWs in the United States (RateMDs, HealthGrades, and Vitals) from March 01 to June 27, 2020. An improved latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling (topic coherence-based LDA [TCLDA]), manual annotation, and sentiment analysis tool were applied to extract a suitable number of topics, generate corresponding keywords, assign topic names, and determine trends in the extracted topics and specific emotions. Results According to the coherence value and manual annotation, the identified taxonomy includes 30 topics across high-rank and low-rank disease categories. The emerging topics in PRWs focus mainly on themes such as treatment experience, policy implementation regarding epidemic control measures, individuals’ attitudes toward the pandemic, and mental health across high-rank diseases. In contrast, the treatment process and experience during COVID-19, awareness and COVID-19 control measures, and COVID-19 deaths, fear, and stress were the most popular themes for low-rank diseases. Panic buying and daily life impact, treatment processes, and bedside manner were the fading themes across high-rank diseases. In contrast, provider attitude toward patients during the pandemic, detection at public transportation, passenger, travel bans and warnings, and materials supplies and society support during COVID-19 were the most fading themes across low-rank diseases. Regarding sentiment analysis, negative emotions (fear, anger, and sadness) prevail during the early wave of the COVID-19. Conclusion Mining topic dynamics and sentiment trends in PRWs may provide valuable knowledge of patients’ opinions during the COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers should consider these PORs and develop global healthcare policies and surveillance systems through monitoring PRWs.

88,Using telehealth to improve buprenorphine access during and after COVID-19: A rapid response initiative in Rhode Island,"Despite its proven efficacy, buprenorphine remains dramatically underutilized for management of opioid use disorder largely due to onerous barriers to treatment initiation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many substance use disorder treatment facilities have reduced their hours and services, exacerbating existing barriers. To this end, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration adjusted their guidelines to allow for new buprenorphine prescriptions following audio-only telehealth encounters, no longer requiring an in-person evaluation prior to treatment initiation. Under this new guidance, we established a 24/7 telephone hotline to function as a “tele-bridge” clinic where people with opioid use disorder can be linked with a buprenorphine prescriber in real-time for OUD assessment and unobserved buprenorphine initiation with connection to follow-up if appropriate. Additionally, we developed an ED callback protocol to reach patients recently seen for opioid overdose and facilitate their entry into care if interested. In this commentary we describe our hotline and ED callback protocols, discuss theoretical and anecdotal benefits to this approach, and advocate for continuation of current regulatory changes post-COVID-19 to maintain expanded access to novel treatment approaches.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108283,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108283,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108283,2021-05-01,,,
89,"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health among 157,213 Americans","Background The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented crisis with potential negative mental health impacts. Methods This study used data collected via Youper, a mental health app, from February through July 2020. Youper users (N = 157,213) in the United States self-reported positive and negative emotions and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. We examined emotions and symptoms before (pre), during (acute), and after (sustained) COVID-related stay-at-home orders. Results For changes in frequency of reported acute emotions, from the pre to acute periods, anxiety increased while tiredness, calmness, happiness, and optimism decreased. From the acute to sustained periods, sadness, depression, and gratitude increased. Anxiety, stress, and tiredness decreased. Between the pre and sustained periods, sadness and depression increased, as did happiness and calmness. Anxiety and stress decreased. Among symptom measures, anxiety increased initially, from the pre to the acute periods, but later returned to baseline. Limitations The study sample was primarily comprised of young people and women. The app does not collect racial or ethnicity data. These factors may limit generalizability. Sample size was also not consistent for all data collected. Conclusions The present study suggests that although there were initial negative impacts on emotions and mental health symptoms in the first few weeks, many Americans demonstrated resilience over the following months. The impact of the pandemic on mental health may not be as severe as predicted, although future work is necessary to understand longitudinal effects as the pandemic continues.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.056,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.056,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.056,2021-05-01,,,
90,Substance use treatment in Appalachian Tennessee amid COVID-19: Challenges and preparing for the future,"The COVID-19 pandemic created a number of rapidly emerging and unprecedented challenges for those engaged in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, forcing service providers to improvise their treatment strategies as the crisis deepened. Drawing from five ongoing federally funded SUD projects in Appalachian Tennessee and hundreds of hours of meetings and interviews, this article explores the pandemic's impact on an already structurally disadvantaged region, its recovery community, and those who serve it. More specifically, we note detrimental effects of increased isolation since the implementation of COVID-19 safety measures, including stakeholders' reports of higher incidences of relapse, overdose, and deaths in the SUD population. Treatment providers have responded with telehealth services, but faced barriers in technology access and computer literacy among clients. Providers have also had to restrict new clients to accommodate social distancing, faced delays in health screening those they can accept, and denied family visitations, which has affected retention. In light of these challenges, several promising lessons for the future emerged––such as preparing for an influx of new and returning clients in need of SUD treatment; making arrangements for long-term housing and facility modification; developing a hybrid care delivery model, taking advantage of new regulations enabling telemedicine; budgeting for and storing personal protective equipment (PPE) and related supplies; and developing disaster protocols to withstand threats to intake, retention, and financial solvency.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108270,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108270,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108270,2021-05-01,,,
91,Prior depression predicts greater stress during Covid-19 mandatory lockdown among college students in France,"Background The Covid-19 pandemic and its related public health measures such as mandatory lockdowns have been shown to have an impact on mental health. A key question is the role of pre-existing psychiatric disorders in how such measures are experienced. Methods During the first country-wide lockdown imposed in France, a Covid-19 module was added to the French portion of the ongoing World Mental Health International college student survey. The present study focuses on respondents who completed the survey during that time frame (n = 291). Results Students with prior depression endorsed greater increases in anxiety (72.2% vs 50.9%) and stress (72.2% vs 49.4%), as well as greater decreases in concentration (87.0% vs 72.9%) during lockdown as compared to those without depression history. In multivariate analyses, prior depression was associated with overall stress (AOR = 5.50), financial stress (AOR = 1.95), family stress (AOR = 2.47), work related stress (AOR = 5.15), and stress related to loved ones (AOR = 2.21). Prior depression was also associated with greater probability experiencing increased anxiety (AOR = 2.61) and stress (AOR = 2.55) during lockdown. Conclusions The findings indicate that the best predictor of experiencing stress and anxiety during the first Covid-19 lockdown was a history of depression prior to the pandemic outbreak. Implementing public health measures such as mandatory national lockdowns should be accompanied by strategies for reaching out to those who are vulnerable due to a history of mental illness.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152234,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152234,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152234,2021-05-01,,,
92,Coping strategies in obsessive-compulsive patients during Covid-19 lockdown,"Background/Objective The main aim of this study was to compare coping strategies in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients and a healthy control group during COVID-19 lockdown and to analyze the relationship with some variables which may influence results (depression, anxiety, comorbidity, subtype of obsession-compulsion). Method: There were 237 participants, 122 OCD and 115 healthy controls, aged 17-61 years old (M = 33.48, SD = 11.13). Results: Groups showed differences in the use of some adaptive strategies (positive reinterpretation, acceptance, humor) and maladaptive (denial, self-blame). Within obsessive-compulsive group, comorbidity affected the greater use of inappropriate strategies (denial, substance abuse and self-blame) while type of obsession-compulsion did not influence use. Anxiety and depression levels were related to the use of less adaptive strategies. Conclusions: These findings strengthen the need for training in the use of effective and adaptive coping strategies, making it necessary to improve clinical follow-up of these patients.

93,Clinician perspectives on methadone service delivery and the use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study,"Objectives During the COVID-19 pandemic, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) in the U.S. were granted new flexibility in methadone dispensing and the use of telemedicine. To explore the impact of the pandemic and accompanying policy changes on service delivery, we asked OTP clinicians about changes in care patterns and perceptions of impacts on access and quality. Methods In May–June 2020, we completed semistructured telephone interviews with 20 OTP clinicians (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) from 13 U.S. states. The study recruited participants through Medscape, an online platform where clinicians access clinical content. We used rapid thematic analysis, a qualitative approach, to summarize participants' expressed views related to the research objectives. Results Clinicians identified a range of changes to methadone and ancillary service delivery as a result of COVID-19. Most clinicians reported that OTPs were prescribing more take-home doses of methadone and providing psychosocial services and medication management via telemedicine. Many also reported reducing the frequency of urine toxicology screening and accepting fewer new patients. While some clinicians expressed support for the increased flexibility around dosing and use of telemedicine, others expressed concern about increased risk of medication diversion and overdose. Clinicians reported several advantages and disadvantages of the changes due to the pandemic and that continued reimbursement would be required to maintain telemedicine services. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered the delivery of methadone treatment in the U.S. This study's findings suggest that OTPs may have reduced their methadone treatment during the early months of the pandemic and that the flexibilities that policy changes offered may not have resulted in changes in care delivery for all patients. Careful consideration and additional analysis should inform which changes OTPs should maintain long-term.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108288,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108288,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108288,2021-05-01,,,
94,Predictors of mental health among parents of children with cerebral palsy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran: A web-based cross-sectional study,"Background Caring for children with cerebral palsy (CP) for many aspects of their lives may affect caregiver’s psychological health. Emergence of COVID-19 put added pressure on caregivers. Aims The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological health of Iranian caregivers of children with CP and associated risks during a lockdown period. Methods Using online snowball sampling, 160 caregivers of children with CP participated in this web-based cross-sectional study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), Caregiver Difficulties Scale (CDS), and a demographic questionnaire were administered. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was applied to identify risk factors related to caregiver psychological health. Outcomes and results Mental health problems were prevalent; (depression = 45.0% and anxiety = 40.6%). Significant correlations were found between CDS and HADS-Anxiety (r = 0.472, P < 0.001), HADS-depression (r = 0.513, P < 0.001), and perceived stress (PSS) related to COVID-19 (r = 0.425, P < 0.001). After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, burden (CDS) was found to significantly predict caregiver anxiety, depression and stress. Furthermore, several demographic characteristics (being married, low educational level and low income) were significantly related to high HADS Anxiety scores. For depression, only having a physical problem was significantly related to HADS among demographic variables. No significant correlations were found between PSS-4 and demographic variables. Conclusions and implications During COVID-19 outbreak, the mental health of caregivers of children with CP is affected by multiple factors such as burden of care and demographic characteristics. Due to the importance of well-being among caregivers of disabled children, a comprehensive plan including psychological consultation, remote education, or in-person handouts for the self-care or handling of the children and adequate distance support may enable better mental health for these caregivers.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103890,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103890,Scopus,10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103890,2021-05-01,,,
95,"Does peritraumatic distress predict PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms during and after COVID-19 lockdown in France? A prospective longitudinal study","Background COVID-19 peritraumatic distress (CPD), an emerging trauma-related psychopathology, involves immediate physiological arousal as well as emotional and cognitive responses to the threat of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study examined the prevalence of and temporal changes in CPD, its early and follow-up predictors and the extent to which it was predictive of mental health problems. Methods The study took a two-wave design approach and was conducted during and 3–4 months after the nationwide lockdown in France. Baseline participants were 1123 (79.5% women; M age = 33.82; range: 18–80). They completed validated measures assessing CPD, posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety symptoms. Descriptive, correlational, and path model analyses were used. Findings Both baseline and follow-up groups presented similar psychosocial profiles. Overall, 35.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 32.7–38.4) baseline participants and 17.2% (95% CI: 12.6–22.7) follow-up participants developed clinical cases of CPD. The baseline CPD levels predicted 14–20% of the variances of PTS (b = 0.55), depression (b = 0.16) and anxiety symptoms (b = 0.16). After accounting for the effect of the baseline CPD levels, the current CPD levels predicted the three investigated mental health outcomes in high proportions (43–47%). Further findings revealed important temporal changes in baseline predictors of CPD. However, the chronic CPD and PTS symptoms were prevalent among students and individuals developing worries about the COVID-19 crisis while depression and anxiety symptoms were prevalent among single people and those with pre-existing mental health problems. Limitations Data from self-report measures of mental health were used. The dropout rate between the two time assessments was relatively high. Conclusions These longitudinal findings call for clinical efforts in assessment of and intervention in trauma-related distress. These efforts should be put into the predictive role of CPD in subsequent development of PTS symptoms and comorbidities as long as the health, social and economic consequences of the pandemic linger.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.035,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.035,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.035,2021-05-01,,,
96,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, access to care, and health disparities in the perinatal period","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health and created barriers to healthcare. In this study, we sought to elucidate the pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care for perinatal individuals. Methods This cross-sectional study of individuals in Massachusetts who were pregnant or up to three months postpartum with a history of depressive symptoms examined associations between demographics and psychiatric symptoms (via validated mental health screening instruments) and the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care. Chi-square associations and multivariate regression models were used. Results Of 163 participants, 80.8% perceived increased symptoms of depression and 88.8% of anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD at time of interview, higher education, and income were associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD were also associated with perceived changes in access to mental healthcare. Compared to non-Hispanic White participants, participants of color (Black, Asian, Multiracial, and/or Hispanic/Latinx) were more likely to report that the pandemic changed their mental healthcare access (aOR:3.25, 95%CI:1.23, 8.59). Limitations Limitations included study generalizability, given that participants have a history of depressive symptoms, and cross-sectional design. Conclusions The pandemic has increased symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety and impacted perceived access to care. Self-reported increases in depression and anxiety and changes to healthcare access varied by education, race/ethnicity, income, and positive screens. Understanding these differences is important to address perinatal mental health and provide equitable care.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.056,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.056,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.056,2021-05-01,,,
97,Addressing the critical need for long-term mental health data during the COVID-19 pandemic: Changes in mental health from April to September 2020,"Despite the large amounts of research currently being conducted and the high number of editorials warning about the potential mental health impacts, there is a stunning lack of longitudinal mental health data on the effects of the pandemic. Yet, the pandemic may have sizable long-term impacts on psychological distress and health behaviors—these effects may be long-lasting and may disproportionately affect some demographic groups more than others. Data came from a longitudinal international study of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults' psychological distress and wellbeing (N = 1567). We found high rates of depression (55% were diagnosable with probable depression at baseline), anxiety (65%), and risk for PTSD (51%). More than one-third of participants who reported that they drank alcohol indicated that their drinking had increased since the start of the pandemic. Over time, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased significantly, but acute stress symptoms decreased. Specific demographic groups (people of color and sexual and gender minorities) appeared to be at high risk of distress across analyses. Our findings suggest high rates of depression, anxiety, acute stress, and other signs of distress like isolation, hopelessness, and use of substances to cope—even at five-month follow-up. Our findings suggest a need to prioritize availability of, and access to, mental health care during both the pandemic and the recovery.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106465,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106465,Scopus,10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106465,2021-05-01,,,
98,A predictable home environment may protect child mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective Information about the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent and adult mental health is growing, yet the impacts on preschool children are only emerging. Importantly, environmental factors that augment or protect from the multidimensional and stressful influences of the pandemic on emotional development of young children are poorly understood. Methods Depressive symptoms in 169 preschool children (mean age 4.1 years) were assessed with the Preschool Feelings Checklist during a state-wide stay-at-home order in Southern California. Mothers (46% Latinx) also reported on externalizing behaviors with the Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire. To assess the role of environmental factors in child mental health we examined household income, food insecurity, parental essential worker status and loss of parental job, as well as preservation of the structure of children's daily experiences with the Family Routines Inventory. Results Sixty-one percent of families' incomes were below the living wage and 50% had at least one parent who was an essential worker. Overall, preschoolers’ depressive and externalizing symptoms were elevated compared to pre-COVID norms. Practice of family routines robustly predicted better child mental health, and this protective effect persisted after covarying income, dual-parent status and food insecurity as well as maternal depression and stress. Conclusion The stress of the COVID-19 pandemic is exacting a significant toll on the mental health of preschool children. Importantly, maintaining a structured, predicable home environment by adherence to family routines appears to mitigate these adverse effects, providing empiric basis for public health recommendations.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100291,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100291,Scopus,10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100291,2021-05-01,,,
99,COVID-19 pandemic effects in people with Autism Spectrum Disorder and their caregivers: Evaluation of social distancing and lockdown impact on mental health and general status,"Among the difficulties associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are those related to adaptation to changes and new situations, as well as anxious-depressive symptoms frequently related to excessive environmental requirements. The main objective of this research is to study the psychological impact of the lockdown due to the social emergency situation (COVID-19) in children/adolescents and adults diagnosed with ASD. Participants were 37 caregivers of children/adolescents with ASD, also 35 ASD adults and 32 informants. Evaluation was conducted through a web survey system and included standardized clinical questionnaires (CBCL and SCL-90-R), which were compared with results before lockdown start, and a brief self-reported survey addressing the subjective perception of changes in daily functioning areas. The results revealed a reduction of psychopathological symptoms in both age groups, but only reaching statistical significance in the adult group, except for Somatization, Anxiety, and Obsessive-Compulsive domains. ASD severity Level 2 showed greater improvement after lockdown onset in the children/adolescent group when compared to ASD Level 1 participants. Younger adults (18–25 yoa) reported greater improvement than older adults (=>25 yoa). Survey results indicate an improvement of feeding quality and a reduction in the number of social initiations during the lockdown. Adult ASD participants perceived a decrease in stress levels after the lockdown onset, whereas caregivers reported higher stress levels at the same point in both age groups. Limitations included the small number of participants and a heterogeneous evaluation window between measures. Pyschopathological status after two months of social distancing and lockdown seems to improve in ASD young adult population.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101757,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101757,Scopus,10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101757,2021-05-01,,,
100,Pandemic dreams: quantitative and qualitative features of the oneiric activity during the lockdown due to COVID-19 in Italy,"Objective The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on daily habits, emotional experience, mental health and sleep. A large body of evidence suggests that dreams are affected by both waking experiences and sleep pattern. In this view, the lockdown should have induced intense modifications in dreaming activity. The aim of the study was to assess dream features during the lockdown in Italy. Methods We used an online survey to collect self-reported demographic, clinical, sleep and dream data. Our sample included 1091 participants. Results Results point to an increased dream frequency, emotional load, vividness, bizarreness and length during the lockdown, compared to a pre-lockdown period. Higher dream frequency and specific qualitative features were found in females and subjects with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviours and depressive symptoms. Most of the dream features assessed during the lockdown were predicted by age, gender, depressive symptoms, presence/absence of other people at home, and territorial area. A specific focus on sleep features revealed that sleep duration and several sleep quality indexes were the best predictors of dream variables. During the lockdown, dreams were also characterized by increased negative emotions, which were particularly frequent in females, younger adults, and participants with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviours, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conclusions Our results confirm the hypothesis of a strong influence of the pandemic on dreaming, supporting both the hypothesis of continuity between wake and sleep mental processes and the view of a crucial influence of sleep quality and duration on dreaming activity.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.006,2021-05-01,,,
101,Psychological distress and feelings of loneliness: What are the impacts of Covid-19 losckdown on the French population?,"The COVID-19 pandemic created a worldwide health crisis. This crisis resulted in an almost two-month lockdown in France — lockdown that has serious impacts on physical and mental health. This unprecedented situation resulted in an important reflection about the mental health of the persons experiencing this crisis. The aim of our study was to apprehend the emotional state of the persons experiencing this lockdown, taking into account day-to-day life and feelings of loneliness. In order to develop a good comprehension of the impact of this situation on mental health, we recruited 4689 persons through an online survey between March 17th and May 11th of 2020 in France. We used several psychometric tools that gave us access to various data, such as socio-biographical information, situational variables — place of living, work context, etc. — and psychological state — depressive symptoms, anxiety, loneliness, etc. This paper focuses mostly on the UCLA loneliness scale, and the French Canadian version of the Psychiatric Symptoms Index (PSI), which measures psychological distress, as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Results show a moderate psychological distress for 27.5% of our sample, with depressive symptomatology, irritability or cognitive impairment. There is also a high loneliness feeling in 21.8% of the sample. Psychological distress is explained by sociodemographic variables — such as gender and age — but also by situational information — type of housing and persistence of income — and the loneliness feeling. If this pandemic and this lockdown show a clear impact on the emotional life of the French population, these results need to be taken into account with a broader range of situational and psychological variables. These additional data would help us have a more thorough understanding of the underlying factors explaining this difficult experience of the crisis. This comprehension also needs to go further in time and think about the repercussions beyond the end of the lockdown, in order to observe the evolution of these emotions and the potential persistence of psychological distress.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejtd.2020.100189,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejtd.2020.100189,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejtd.2020.100189,2021-05-01,,,
102,Temporal association of contamination obsession on the prehospital delay of STEMI during COVID-19 pandemic,"Background One of the modifiable risk factors for ST elevation myocardial infarction is prehospital delay. The purpose of our study was to look at the effect of contamination contamination obsession on prehospital delay compared with other measurements during the Covid-19 pandemic. Method A total of 139 patients with acute STEMI admitted to our heart center from 20 March 2020 to 20 June 2020 were included in this study. If the time interval between the estimated onset of symptoms and admission to the emergency room was >120 min, it was considered as a prehospital delay. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Padua Inventory-Washington State University Revision (PI-WSUR) test were used to assess Contamination-Obbsessive compulsive disorder (C-OCD). Result The same period STEMI count compared to the previous year decreased 25%. The duration of symptoms onset to hospital admission was longer in the first month compared to second and third months (180 (120–360), 120 (60–180), and 105 (60–180), respectively; P = 0.012). Multivariable logistic regression (model-2) was used to examine the association between 7 candidate predictors (age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, smoking, pain-onset time, and coronary artery disease (CAD) history), PI-WSUR C-OCD, and admission month with prehospital delay. Among variables, PI-WSUR C-OCD and admission month were independently associated with prehospital delay (OR 5.36 (2.11–13.61) (P = 0.01); 0.26 (0.09–0.87) p < 0.001] respectively].

103,Characterization and impact assessment of super cyclonic storm AMPHAN in the Indian subcontinent through space borne observations,"Tropical cyclones can cause extensive damage in coastal regions as a result of high winds, storm tide, and intense rainfall. The West Bengal state in India was severely affected by a recent cyclonic storm 'Amphan' a 'super cyclone'with a high wind speed of above 220 km/h. The present study aimed to assess the impact of the cyclone Amphan in the potential impact zone covering the two states of India (Odisha and West Bengal) and the west coast of Bangladesh. The present study analyzed the land use land cover, rainfall variability, and potential storm surge along the cyclone track to assess the possible impact on the coastal landscape as well as community. The cyclone Amphan was formed in the Northern Indian Ocean near Equatorial Easterly wave over south Andaman Sea and adjoiningsoutheast Bay of Bengal (BoB) at 10° N 87° E on 16 May 2020 as deep depression and moved toward the north direction and had land fall at the coast of West Bengal on 20 May 2020 as an extremely severe cyclonic storm with the wind speed 155 km/h and central pressure of 960hpa.The cyclone devastated the coastal districts of West Bengal due to the high intensity of precipitation along with the extreme storm surge. About 100 people lost their lives and ~20 million people severely affected in West Bengal alone. Within the West Bengal state, around 7877 sq km area was observed under the potential storm surge zone. Cropland was observed as the most surge affected land cover with 5191 sq km area (65.9%), followed by wetlands (1635.2 sq km (20.75%) along with 38.34 sq km (0.48%)) of built up land under the potential surge impact zone The cyclone more severely affected the west Medinapur and South 24 Parganas, which were also the most affected by COVID-19 which resulted in slow evacuation, delay in medical support and concomitant increase in loss of life.

104,Fever range whole body hyperthermia for re-irradiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: Final results of a prospective study,"Objectives Fever-range whole body hyperthermia (FRWBH) has been shown to improve tumor oxygenation in vivo. A prospective pilot study addressed the question if addition of FRWBH to re-irradiation is feasible in recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with unfavorable prognostic features. Materials and methods The study completed accrual with the recruitment of ten patients between April 2018 and March 2020. Re-irradiation was administered using volumetric arc hyperfractionated radiotherapy with bi-daily 1.2 Gray (Gy) single fractions and a total dose of 66 Gy to all macroscopic tumor lesions. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted mostly of cisplatin (7 patients). FRWBH was scheduled weekly during re-irradiation. The study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (NCT03547388). Results Only five patients received all cycles of FRWBH. Poor patient compliance, active infections during treatment and study restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic were the main reasons for omitting FRWBH. No increase of acute toxicity was observed by FRWBH. Exploratory evaluation of outcome data suggests that FRWBH treatment according to protocol does not seem to have a detrimental effect on tumor control or survival and might even increase treatment efficacy. Conclusion FRWBH is difficult to apply concomitant to re-irradiation in HNSCC. No excess toxicity was observed in patients receiving FRWBH and exploratory analyses suggest potential anti-tumor activity and decreased patient-reported depression scores after FRWBH.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105240,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105240,Scopus,10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105240,2021-05-01,,,
105,The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: An umbrella review of meta-analyses,"Background Healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, are particularly susceptible to physical and mental health consequences such as anxiety and depression. The aim of this umbrella review of meta-analyses is to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using relevant keywords, data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase were searched to obtain systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of January to the end of October 2020. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess heterogeneity among studies. Data was analyzed using STATA 14 software. Results In the primary search, 103 studies were identified, and ultimately 7 studies were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83–28.05, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41–28.25, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively. Conclusion This umbrella review shows that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is relatively high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

106,Mental health consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak in Spain. A longitudinal study of the alarm situation and return to the new normality,"Aims The objective is to conduct a longitudinal analysis of the effects of the pandemic and alarm situation on the mental health of the general population at three points in time: two weeks after beginning the confinement, after a month, and after two months, when the lockdown was lifted and the country returned to the new normality. Methods The evaluations were carried out by means of an online survey, with a sample of 3480 persons in the first data collection and 1041 and 569 persons in the successive evaluation periods. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, Covid-19 variables, loneliness, psychological well-being, social support, discrimination and a sense of belonging, were collected. Results Depressive symptoms increased significantly throughout the confinement, decreasing at the last assessment but not dropping to previous levels. In anxiety, there are no significant changes between the three evaluations, but a downward trend can be seen over time. Regarding the symptomatology of PTSD, a downward trend is observed throughout the three evaluations, with significantly lower scores between the first and third assessments. The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD. Conclusions This research shows that the pandemic has had a negative impact on our mental health, which still does not seem to be at pre-crisis levels, although it has improved as the emergency situation subsides. These results underline the importance of paying greater attention to mental health, and reveal key variables such as spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness in which to intervene from different care services, as well as younger people and women as vulnerable groups on which to focus more attention.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110219,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110219,Scopus,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110219,2021-04-20,,,
107,The impact of COVID-19 lockdown and of the following “re-opening” period on specific and general psychopathology in people with Eating Disorders: the emergent role of internalizing symptoms,"Background We assessed the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on specific Eating Disorder (ED) and general psychopathology in people with an ED diagnosis during the lockdown period and after the end of the related containment measures. Methods People with clinically defined diagnosis and undergoing treatment for an ED completed an online survey, which included adapted questions from standardized psychometric scales. Data relative to three different time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were collected. Psychopathological changes over these periods were investigated and compared through one-way analysis of variance or covariance with repeated measures. Results Three hundred twelve people completed the survey (57.4% diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or atypical AN, 20.2% with Bulimia Nervosa, 15.4% with Binge Eating Disorder, 7.05% with Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders). The severity of both specific and general psychopathology increased during the lockdown and the rise of general symptoms persisted in the following re-opening phase, except for suicide ideation. Almost all of these findings were not affected by ED diagnosis, participants’ age and illness duration. Limitations The retrospective nature of data collection is the main limitation of the study. Conclusions People with EDs showed a COVID-19 emergency-induced worsening of both general and specific psychopathology. The effect on general psychopathology persisted in the re-opening period. These findings suggest a high stress vulnerability of ED individuals with important effects on internalizing symptoms, which are worth of attention by clinicians.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.037,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.037,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.037,2021-04-15,,,
108,Examining temporal interactions between loneliness and depressive symptoms and the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties among UK residents during the COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal results from the COVID-19 psychological wellbeing study,"Background Longitudinal studies examining the temporal association between mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak are needed. It is important to determine how relationships between key outcomes, specifically loneliness and depressive symptoms, manifest over a brief timeframe and in a pandemic context. Method Data was gathered over 4 months (March – June 2020) using an online survey with three repeated measures at monthly intervals (N = 1958; 69.8% females; Age 18-87 years, M = 37.01, SD = 12.81). Associations between loneliness, depression symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulty were tested using Pearson's product moment correlations, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all study variables. Cross-lagged structural equation modelling was used to examine the temporal relationships between variables. Results The longitudinal association between loneliness and depressive symptoms was reciprocal. Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms one month later, and depressive symptoms predicted higher loneliness one month later. The relationship was not mediated by emotion regulation difficulties. Emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms were also reciprocally related over time. Limitations Limitations include the reliance on self-report data and the non-representative sample. There was no pre-pandemic assessment limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Conclusions Loneliness should be considered an important feature of case conceptualisation for depression during this time. Clinical efforts to improve mental health during the pandemic could focus on interventions that target either loneliness, depression, or both. Potential approaches include increasing physical activity or low-intensity cognitive therapies delivered remotely.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.033,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.033,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.033,2021-04-15,,,

Design Observational, cross-sectional. Methods An online survey was disseminated to adults (n=8,425; 44.5±14.8y) residing in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia within the first 2-6 weeks of government-mandated COVID-19 restrictions. Main outcome measures included: Stages of Change scale for exercise behaviour change; International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short-form); World Health Organisation-5 Well-being Index; and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-9. Results Participants who reported a negative change in exercise behaviour from before initial COVID-19 restrictions to during the initial COVID-19 restrictions demonstrated poorer mental health and well-being compared to those demonstrating either a positive-or no change in their exercise behaviour (p <0.001). Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p <0.001). Individuals who had more positive exercise behaviours reported better mental health and well-being (p <0.001). Although there were no differences in PA between countries, individuals in New Zealand reported better mental health and well-being (p <0.001). Conclusion The initial COVID-19 restrictions have differentially impacted upon PA habits of individuals based upon their age and sex, and therefore have important implications for international policy and guideline recommendations. Public health interventions that encourage PA should target specific groups (e.g., men, young adults) who are most vulnerable to the negative effects of physical distancing and/or self-isolation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2020.11.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2020.11.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsams.2020.11.016,2021-04-01,,,
110,Effects of centralized isolation vs. home isolation on psychological distress in patients with COVID-19,"Objective This study aimed to evaluate the impact of isolation form on the recovery of psychological distress in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after being discharged from hospital. Methods Baseline survey was conducted from February 10, 2020 to February 25, 2020 in patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital on the discharge day. After discharge, patients were free to choose whether isolate in a centralized isolation site (i.e. designated hotel) or their own home for another two weeks. A follow-up survey was conducted at the end of the 2-week post-discharge isolation. Depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health were assessed at both time points using the 9-item patient health questionnaire, 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale and self-rated health scores, respectively. Results Fifty centrally isolated and 45 home isolated patients completed both the baseline and the follow-up assessments. Significant effects of time and time by isolation form were found on depression and anxiety levels, with a significant decrease in depression and anxiety shown in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. Besides, a significant time effect was identified on self-rated health with significant improvement found in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. Conclusions Home isolation is superior to centralized isolation in the recovery of COVID-19-associated depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health. More attention needs to be paid to the psychological well-being of centrally isolated patients. A sustained and integrated rehabilitation plan is warranted for patients with COVID-19 to achieve both physical and psychological recovery.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110365,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110365,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110365,2021-04-01,,,

113,Prospective prediction of PTSD and depressive symptoms during social unrest and COVID-19 using a brief online tool,"Large-scale protracted population stressors, such as social unrest and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are associated with increased symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Cost-effective mental health screening is prerequisite for timely intervention. We developed an online tool to identify prospective predictors of PTSD and depressive symptoms in the context of co-occurring social unrest and COVID-19 in Hong Kong. 150 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments, with a median duration of 29 days. Three logistic regression models were constructed to assess its discriminative power in predicting PTSD and depressive symptoms at one month. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed for each model to determine their optimal decision thresholds. Sensitivity and specificity of the models were 87.1% and 53.8% for probable PTSD, 77.5% and 63.3% for high-risk depressive symptoms, and 44.7% and 96.4% for no significant depressive symptoms. The models performed well in discriminating outcomes (AUCs range: 0.769–0.811). Probable PTSD was predicted by social unrest-related traumatic events, high rumination, and low resilience. Rumination and resilience also predicted high-risk and no significant depressive symptoms, with COVID-19-related events also predicting no significant depression risk. Accessible screening of probable mental health outcomes with good predictive capability may be important for early intervention opportunities.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113773,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113773,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113773,2021-04-01,,,
114,Increases in distress during stay-at-home mandates During the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has contributed to over 500,000 deaths, and hospitalization of thousands of individuals worldwide. Cross-sectional data indicate that anxiety and depression levels are greater during the pandemic, yet no known prospective studies have tested this assertion. Further, individuals with elevated trait anxiety prior to a global pandemic may theoretically be more apt to experience greater pandemic-related anxiety and/or impairment. The current study tested whether anxiety and depression increased from the month before the state's Stay-At-Home order to the period of the Stay-At-Home order among 120 young adults in Louisiana, a state with especially high rates of COVID-19 related infections and deaths. We also tested whether pre-pandemic social anxiety was related to greater pandemic related anxiety, depression, and COVID-related worry and impairment. Depression but not anxiety increased during the Stay-At-Home order. Further, pre-pandemic trait anxiety, social anxiety, and depression were statistically significant predictors of anxiety and depression during the Stay-At-Home order, although only social anxiety was robustly related to COVID-related worry and impairment. Emotional distress increased during the COVID-19 pandemic Stay-At-Home order and this is especially the case among individuals with pre-pandemic elevations in trait anxiety (especially social anxiety) and depression.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113821,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113821,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113821,2021-04-01,,,
115,Data on media use and mental health during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China,"The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly in China in beginning of 2020. Self-quarantine was suggested by Chinese government to block the spread of the COVID-19. During the self-quarantine, the media played an indispensable role in acquisition of information about the disease. And it could also impact on people's mental health. Therefore, it is necessary to study the psychological outcome resulted from media use during the outbreak of COVID-19. The data in this article could help researchers to explore the mechanism between media use and mental health, and to have a deeper comprehension of the impact of media use on mental health during a public health emergency. The dataset provided in this article included 917 participants recruited from different provinces all over China. Among the participants, there were 304 males and 613 females, with an average age of 28.6 and a standard deviation of 9.5. They took Media Use Questionnaire (MUQ), Empathy-Sympathy Questionnaire (ESQ), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Death Anxiety Questionnaire (DAQ), Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), State boredom Questionnaire (SBQ), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) to assess their media use and mental health during the outbreak of COVID-19. All these instruments for data collection were Chinese versions. In addition, a .csv file consists of major variables we used are included as a supplementary material. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression had been conducted with these data.

117,"Impact of the first Covid-19 pandemic wave on first episode psychosis in Milan, italy.","The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic appears to increase risk for mental illness, either directly due to inflammation caused by the virus or indirectly due to related psychosocial stress, resulting in the development of both anxious-depressive and psychotic symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to assess the frequency and characteristics of all patients with First Episodes Psychosis (FEP) without COVID-19 infection hospitalized in the first four months since lockdown in Milan. We recruited sixty-two patients hospitalized between March 8 to July 8, 2020 versus those first hospitalized in the same period in 2019. The two subgroups were compared for sociodemographic variables and clinical characteristics of the episodes. Patients with FEP in 2020 were significantly older than patients with FEP in 2021, and presented with significantly less substances abuse. Interestingly, patients presenting with FEP in 2020 were significantly older than patients with FEP in 2019. These data are compatible with the greater vulnerability to stressful factors during the pandemic, as well as with the greater concern regarding a possible COVID-19 infection producing brain damage causing the FEP.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113802,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113802,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113802,2021-04-01,,,
118,"Longitudinal changes of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: The role of pre-existing anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders","Especially individuals with mental disorders might experience an escalation of psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the role of anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders for levels and longitudinal changes of COVID-19-related fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. In a longitudinal observational design with four assessment waves from March, 27th until June, 15th 2020, a total of 6,551 adults from Germany was assessed. 4,175 individuals participated in one, 1,070 in two, 803 in three, and 503 in all four waves of data collection. Multilevel analyses revealed that across all assessment waves, COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in individuals with vs. without anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders. All symptoms decreased on average over time, and this decrease was significantly stronger in individuals with vs. without anxiety disorders, and particularly driven by individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. Our findings suggest that individuals with mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders – and in particular those with a generalized anxiety disorder – seem to be vulnerable to experience psychological strain in the context of the pandemic, might likely overestimate potential threat, and should be targeted by preventive and therapeutic interventions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102377,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102377,Scopus,10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102377,2021-04-01,,,

Aim: To assess the mental health status of ambulatory cardiometabolic patients during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Spanish speaking Latin American countries. Methods: Cardiometabolic patients without COVID-19 evidence in 13 Latin American countries answered a survey between June 15th and July 15th, 2020. The Diagnosis Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition was used to identify the presence of major depressive symptoms. Results: The sample included 4216 patients, 1590 (37.71%; IC95% 36.24-39.19) were considered suffering major depression. Female gender, consuming ≥5 medications day, physical activity <100 minutes weekly, low fruits and vegetables intake, poor treatment adherence, reduced food consumption were independently associated to the presence of major depressive symptoms.

120,"The health and social consequences during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic among current and former people who inject drugs: A rapid phone survey in Baltimore, Maryland","Background There is limited data on the health and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among people who inject drugs (PWID). Methods We conducted a rapid telephone survey from April-June 2020 among participants of the community-based AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland. This interviewer-administered survey collected information on COVID-19 knowledge, symptoms, testing, diagnosis, and prevention behaviors, recent substance use, housing conditions, interruptions to healthcare, access to harm reduction and drug treatment, mental health, and social support. Results Of 443 current and former PWID who participated in the survey, 36 % were female, 85 % were Black, 33 % were living with HIV and 50 % reported any substance use in the prior six months. COVID-19 awareness was high, but knowledge of symptoms and routes of transmission were lower. PWID reporting recent substance use were less likely to always socially distance (63 % vs. 74 % among those without recent use, p = 0.02), and Black PWID were more likely than non-Black to socially distance (73 % vs. 48 %, p < 0.0001) and use when alone (68 % vs.35 %, p < 0.01). Only 6% reported difficulty accessing healthcare, yet only 48 % of those on opioid-agonist treatment had a four-week supply available. While 34 % reported increased depressive symptoms, participants reported high levels of social support. Conclusions This rapid assessment highlighted that PWID currently using drugs may be less able to practice social distancing and increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission may occur. Ongoing monitoring of substance use and mental health, as well as overdose prevention is necessary as the pandemic and public health responses continue.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108584,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108584,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108584,2021-04-01,,,
121,"Essential work, precarious labour: The need for safer and equitable harm reduction work in the era of COVID-19","This commentary highlights labour concerns and inequities within the harm reduction sector that hinder programs’ ability to respond to converging public health emergencies (the overdose crisis and COVID-19), and potentially contribute to spread of the novel coronavirus. Many harm reduction programs continue to support people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic, yet PWUD working in harm reduction programs (sometimes termed ‘peers’) experience precarious labour conditions characterized by low wages, minimal employee benefits (such as paid sick leave) and high employment insecurity. Along with precarious labour conditions, PWUD face heightened vulnerabilities to COVID-19 and yet have been largely overlooked in global response to the pandemic. Operating under conditions of economic and legal precarity, harm reduction programs’ reliance on precarious labour (e.g. on-call, temporary and unpaid work) renders some services vulnerable to staffing shortages and service disruptions during the pandemic, while also heightening the risk of virus transmission among workers, service users and their communities. We call for immediate policy and programmatic actions to strengthen working conditions within these settings with a priority on enhancing protections and supports for workers in peer roles.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103076,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103076,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103076,2021-04-01,,,
122,Associations between feelings/behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and depression/anxiety after lockdown in a sample of Chinese children and adolescents,"Background Children and adolescents may be more susceptible to mental disorders due to COVID-19 pandemic than adults. This study aimed to identify correlated factors for depression/anxiety among children and adolescents after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Methods An online survey by cluster sampling was conducted after lockdown in 5175 Chinese children and adolescents with informed consents from their parents. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scales with 10-point cutoff were used to measure depression and anxiety, separately. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted. Stata 15.1 Version was used. Results 12.33% and 6.26% of all participants reported depression and anxiety after lockdown, separately. Suicidal ideation, quarreling with parents, insomnia, difficulty in concentrating during online learning, and anxious and depressed mood during lockdown were positively associated with depression and anxiety after lockdown. Missing teachers was negatively associated with both depression and anxiety. Living in urban and not living with parents were positively associated with depression. Limitations The past history and familial history of mental disorders have not been collected. The recall biases for collecting self-reporting information might exist, and the causal inferences cannot be drawn. Conclusions The prevalence of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents might decline a bit after lockdown but is still at a high level after lockdown. Gatekeepers should pay more attention to modifiable factors of psychological well-being in children and adolescents, including family and school contexts and even feelings and behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.001,2021-04-01,,,

124,Mental health status of healthcare versus other essential workers in Australia amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: Initial results from the collate project,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has necessitated many healthcare workers operating on the frontlines. Another segment of the population whose mental well-being is being tested are the ‘other essential workers’ (e.g. supermarket workers). The current study aimed to compare the mental health of healthcare versus other essential workers in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE) project is a nationwide online mental health survey launched on 1 April 2020, aimed at identifying key mental health concerns. Adults currently living in Australia were invited to take part, and non-discriminative snowball sampling was employed. Participants were partitioned into healthcare workers (HCW; n=905), other essential workers (OEW; n=810), and the general population (GNP; n=3443). Across all groups, top COVID-19 related concerns were primarily associated with the health and well-being of loved ones. In terms of current levels of depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life, HCWs fared the best, and OEWs fared the worst (with the GNP falling in between). In the face of this medical crisis, Australian HCWs seem to be managing their mental health relatively well, but more supports need to be devoted to OEWs to safeguard their mental well-being.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113822,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113822,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113822,2021-04-01,,,
125,College student mental health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications of campus relocation,"Purpose During the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities evacuated their campuses, requiring students to vacate on campus residences. The psychological outcomes of students who relocated during the pandemic remains unknown. We examined mandated relocation experiences related to self-reported worry, grief, loneliness, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional survey data obtained from April 9 to August 4, 2020 on 791 young adults (ages 18–30 years) who were enrolled at a U.S. university. The CARES 2020 Project (COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study) is an online survey of young adults’ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment relied on snowball sampling. Participants were asked if they were required to relocate from campus and among those who did, their experiences in moving. COVID-19-related worry and grief, loneliness, and depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms were assessed. Results Approximately one-third of students reported being mandated to relocate. Students mandated to relocate reported more COVID-19-related grief, loneliness, and generalized anxiety symptoms compared to those who did not even after controlling for the severity level of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Students who had to leave behind valuable personal belongings reported more COVID-19-related worries, grief, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Students who were mandated to relocate reported worse psychological outcomes compared to students who were not mandated to relocate.

126,Top problems of adolescents and young adults with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective ADHD symptom severity appears to be exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study surveyed top problems experienced by adolescents and young adults (A/YAs) with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify possible reasons for symptom escalation and potential targets for intervention. We also explored perceived benefits of the pandemic for A/YAs with ADHD. Method At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (April–June 2020), we administered self and parent ratings about current and pre-pandemic top problem severity and benefits of the pandemic to a sample of convenience (N = 134 A/YAs with ADHD participating in a prospective longitudinal study). Results The most common top problems reported in the sample were social isolation (parent-report: 26.7%; self-report: 41.5%), difficulties engaging in online learning (parent-report: 23.3%, self-report: 20.3%), motivation problems (parent-report: 27.9%), and boredom (self-report: 21.3%). According to parent (d = 0.98) and self-report (d = 1.33), these top problems were more severe during the pandemic than in prior months. Contrary to previous speculation, there was no evidence that pandemic-related changes mitigated ADHD severity. Multi-level models indicated that A/YAs with higher IQs experienced severer top problems exacerbations at the transition to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions For A/YAs with ADHD, several risk factors for depression and school dropout were incurred during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. A/YAs with ADHD should be monitored for school disengagement and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommended interventions attend to reducing risk factors such as increasing social interaction, academic motivation, and behavioral activation among A/YAs with ADHD.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.009,2021-04-01,,,
127,The impact on mental health patients of COVID-19 outbreak in Spain,"Public health studies warn of the vulnerability of people with mental disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, the aims of this study were to (1) explore the presence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and acute stress among people with a mental disorder (MD); (2) evaluate the rate of COVID-19 infection between MD and non-MD, and (3) study the relationship between the emotional state of people with a mental disorder and some environmental variables. A cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques was conducted. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared in MD and non-MD. The rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases among MD and non-MD was compared as well as the relationship between some environmental variables and the emotional state within MD. Up to 1839 [201 (10.9%) MD] participants completed the survey. MD showed significant higher mean (SD) in anxiety [24.7 (11.8) vs. 17 (10.3); p = 0.001], depression [7.9 (6.0) vs. 4.2 (4.2); p = 0.001] and acute stress [6.3 (3.2) vs. 4.4 (3.1); p = 0.001] scores than non-MD. The COVID-19 confirmed cases rate was higher in MD participants than in non-MD (3.5% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.001). Among the MD group, being a COVID-19 confirmed case, the lack in basic needs coverage, the rpesence of violence, drug use and the absence of physical excercise were associated with more severe depressive symptoms.

However, aggressive measurements against the pandemic were at the expense of economic activities and companies’ financial performances. This cross-sectional study uses a survey of 672 companies in Vietnam and the logistic regression model to explore companies’ coping strategy choices based on their degree of financial distress, companies’ profiles, entrepreneurial factors, and the interactions between them. The results suggest that companies predominantly selected cost-cutting strategies to deal with the economic shutdown. However, the interactions between financial and entrepreneurial factors could significantly increase the likelihood of selecting growth-focused strategies. Besides, when facing a global pandemic such as COVID-19, managers’ perceptions about the spillover effects of global risks were much more impactful than local risks on companies’ coping strategy selections.

129,Update of takotsubo syndrome in the era of COVID-19,"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has become a well-known disease not only in Japan but also in the rest of the world. Early reports suggested that TTS is a self-limiting disease with better prognosis than acute coronary syndrome. However, recent data showed that TTS is not a benign disease as compared with acute coronary syndrome. In addition to the apical ballooning, several other types of wall motion abnormalities have been classified as variants of TTS. In particular, right ventricular involvement, or biventricular TTS, is not uncommon and is associated with poor in-hospital as well as long-term outcomes. With respect to the pathophysiology, modulation (desensitization) of the beta-adrenergic receptor is suspected as a possible mechanism for transiently depressed myocardial contraction. Although specific treatments to improve prognosis of TTS are still uncertain, observational data suggest favorable impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Finally, in the era of COVID-19, we should pay attention to a variety of cardiovascular conditions related to COVID-19. TTS is one of these conditions that can be triggered by both emotional and physical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2020.10.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2020.10.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.jjcc.2020.10.004,2021-04-01,,,

However, there is a limited understanding of suicide among individuals with positive/suspected COVID diagnosis specifically. Hence, this study, using online newspaper reports, aimed to determine factors influencing suicide among individuals withCOVID-19 infection status. Methodology : Information regarding positive/suspected COVID related suicide was obtained from online newspapers published in 4 languages between 30th Jan 2020 to 16th August 2020 using google news aggregator. Of 235 online identified, 93 were eligible for analysis after the exclusion and analysed using descriptive statistics. Results : Median Age of COVID related suicide victims was 45 years (range 15 - 80) wherein 61.3% belonged to 30-59 year age group, and 75.3% were males. 50% of suicides occurred within the first week of COVID diagnosis confirmation, and 50% suicides occurred at COVID centres. Hanging (53.8%) was the commonest method of suicide, followed by jumping (12.9%). Conclusion : Higher risk for suicide was observed among male gender and those with positive/suspected COVID infection within the first week, while receiving treatment in COVID care centres. Hanging and jumping were the two commonest methods.

132,"Attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care needs among parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic","Background COVID-19 pandemic has generated anxiety and mental health issues in the common population. In general, anxiety and poor health are higher in parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) than parents of children without ASD. However, the symptoms of anxiety, depression and poor mental health are likely to be more escalated in parents of children with ASD during COVID-19, possibly due to the emergency measures involving suspension of essential services, closure of schools, work-from-home policy and lack of professional support, etc. Aim This empirical research aimed to explore the attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care of parents of children with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A total of 211 participants, including mothers and fathers of children with ASD from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, participated in this online study. Along with demographic details, data on attitude, anxiety, mental health status and perceived mental health care were obtained using both self-reported questionnaire and reference standard questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using t-test, Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis. The responses to open-ended questions were also collected and analysed qualitatively. Results The study revealed that attitudes towards taking care of children with ASD were affected by parents' age and child's age, and mothers were more affected. Further, the anxiety of parents during COVID-19 was significantly higher than before the COVID-19 situation. It was found that parents' mental status during COVID-19 mediated the interaction between anxiety and perceived mental health care. Finally, the open-ended questions indicated that parents sought support from teachers, family members and therapists to deal with children with ASD during the pandemic outbreak. In the context of perceived mental health care, besides psychological and financial support, other measures like training sessions, online classes, etc., were recommended. Conclusions The findings of this study insisted on the importance of support from government and local health authorities to introduce interventions for parents and children with ASD to improve the overall mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103873,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103873,Scopus,10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103873,2021-04-01,,,

Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. Results With the EPDS cut-off value of 10, the incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms was 56.9%. Age, history of abortion and perceived stress were the influencing factors of postpartum depression (adjusted R 2 = 0.432, F = 23.611, p < .001). The top three health care needs were infant rearing guidance (78.0%), maternal and infant protection guidance (60.3%) and dietary guidance (45.0%). The proportion of psychological rehabilitation guidance needs in the depressed group was significantly higher than that in the non-depressed group (34.5% vs. 20.0%, p < .05). Conclusions Maternal postpartum depression in China was at a high level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women aged 25–34, with a history of abortion and high stress levels were at higher risk for postpartum depression. Timely psychological counselling, intervention and COVID-19-related health education are in great need for postpartum women.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.02.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.02.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.apnu.2021.02.001,2021-04-01,,,
134,Psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 lockdown: A two-wave network analysis,"Background Although preliminary research has evidenced negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population, little research has been carried out examining the interplay among the broader dimensions and correlates of individual distress. Via network analysis, the current study investigated the pathways that underlie some components of psychological distress and their changes over time (during and post COVID-19-related lockdown). Methods 1,129 adult participants (79.1% women) completed a two-wave online survey during and after the lockdown, and reported on variables such as depression, anxiety, stress, fear of COVID, intolerance of uncertainty, emotion regulation and social support. The networks were estimated via Gaussian Graphical Models and their temporal changes were compared through the centrality measures. Results Depression, stress, anxiety and fear of COVID formed a spatially contiguous pattern, which remained unchanged in both the two waves. After the lockdown, the fear of COVID node reduced its strength in the network, whereas inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty and emotion suppression were associated with depression. Emotion regulation was connected to depression, but not to stress and anxiety during both waves. Perceived emotional support had few connections to the other nodes. Limitations Only 32.7% of participants provided complete responses for both waves. Conclusion The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on adults. In the context of the network approach, depressive symptoms had the highest strength and their associations to other dimensions of individual distress may be key factors in understanding the influence of exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.016,2021-04-01,,,
135,"Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on mental health, wellbeing, sleep, and alcohol use in a UK student sample","The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictions imposed by governments worldwide have had profound social and psychological effects, particularly for young adults. This study used longitudinal data to characterise effects on mental health and behaviour in a UK student sample, measuring sleep quality and diurnal preference, depression and anxiety symptoms, wellbeing and loneliness, and alcohol use. Self-report data was collected from 254 undergraduates (219 females) at a UK university at two-time points: autumn 2019 (baseline, pre-pandemic) and April/May 2020 (under ‘lockdown’ conditions). Longitudinal analyses showed a significant rise in depression symptoms and a reduction in wellbeing at lockdown. Over a third of the sample could be classed as clinically depressed at lockdown compared to 15% at baseline. Sleep quality was not affected across the sample as a whole. The increase in depression symptoms was highly correlated with worsened sleep quality. A reduction in alcohol use, and a significant shift towards an ‘evening’ diurnal preference, were also observed. Levels of worry surrounding contracting COVID-19 were high. Results highlight the urgent need for strategies to support young people's mental health: alleviating worries around contracting COVID, and supporting good sleep quality, could benefit young adults’ mental health as the COVID-19 crisis unfolds.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113819,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113819,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113819,2021-04-01,,,

The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used as indicators of symptoms of depression and anxiety in a national online anonymous survey to assess the mental health of adults in Australia during the COVID-19 restrictions. The aim of this study was to describe gender- and age-specific PHQ-9 and GAD-7 item and summary data contributed by those who completed this survey. Data were analysed descriptively. Complete survey responses were contributed by 13,829 people. For both measures, item-by-item results, summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median and interquartile range) and prevalence of severity categories are reported for the whole sample, and disaggregated by gender and age groups.

137,Relationship between sleep quality and the psychological status of patients hospitalised with COVID-19,"Aim We explored the sleep quality of patients who required mental health and clinical interventions in our hospital after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Method We enrolled 189 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in April and May of 2020, of whom 78 were female and 111 male. We evaluated sleep quality and related factors in terms of demographic characteristics, the duration of hospitalisation, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale scores. Results All participants were divided into two groups according to PSQI score: n = 102 (54%) patients with PSQI scores ≥5 and n = 87 (46%) patients with PSQI scores <5. No significant between-group difference was evident in terms of age, gender, marital status, educational level, or chronic disease history. The duration of hospitalisation (p = 0.002) and the depression rate (p = 0.010) were higher in the group exhibiting poor sleep quality (PSQI score ≥5). Conclusion The duration of hospitalisation was longer in patients experiencing poor sleep quality.

138,"Trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A one-month follow-up","Objectives Little is known about the mental health outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The aims of the study were: (1) to examine the trajectories of anxiety, depression, and pandemic-related stress factors (PRSF) of COVID-19 hospitalized patients one-month following hospitalization; (2) to assess the presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) a month after hospitalization; (3) to identify baseline risk and protective factors that would predict PTSS one month after hospitalization. Methods We contacted hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 64) by phone, at three time-points: during the first days after admission to the hospital (T1); after ~two weeks from the beginning of hospitalization (T2), and one month after hospitalization (T3). At all time-points we assessed the levels of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as PRSF. At T3, PTSS were assessed. Results The levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms decreased one-month following hospitalization. Moreover, higher levels of anxiety (standardized β = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.81–1.49, p < 0.001) and depression (β = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.63–1.31 p < 0.001) symptoms during the first week of hospitalization, feeling socially disconnected (β = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37–0.81 p < 0.001) and experiencing a longer hospitalization period (β = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.03–0.47 p = 0.026) predicted higher PTSS scores a month post-hospitalization.

139,"The use of mental health promotion strategies by nurses to reduce anxiety, stress, and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak: A prospective cohort study","Objectives To evaluate and compare nurses' depression, anxiety and stress symptoms at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and after six months; to evaluate and compare the frequency of use of mental health promotion strategies during the same period; and to identify the relationship between the frequency of use of mental health promotion strategies, during the same period, with nurses’ depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Methods Data collection was carried out in two moments: at baseline and after six months. An online questionnaire was applied to nurses to assess the frequency of use of some mental health promotion strategies and their depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (through the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales – short version (DASS-21)). Results The anxiety and stress symptoms significantly decreased over time. The physical activity increased, and a decrease was observed in the remote social contacts after six months. The stress, anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in nurses who frequently or always used all strategies compared to participants who never or rarely used them, except for one strategy (rejecting information about COVID-19 from unreliable sources). Conclusions Mental health promotion strategies, such as physical activity, relaxation activity, recreational activity, healthy diet, adequate water intake, breaks between work shifts, maintenance of remote social contacts, and verbalization of feelings/emotions, are crucial to reduce nurses’ stress, anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110828,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110828,Scopus,10.1016/j.envres.2021.110828,2021-04-01,,,
140,The proportion and associated factors of anxiety in Chinese adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Background Given the serious impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health of Chinese adolescents, this study aimed to examine the proportion of anxiety and its correlates among Chinese adolescents with depression during the pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional online survey was conducted from February 20th to February 27, 2020 in China. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed by the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), respectively. Results In this study, 3,498 adolescents with depression were identified. Of them, the proportion of anxiety was 45.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]=43.5%-46.8%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that being concerned about graduation (OR=1.25, P=0.002, 95% CI=1.09-1.43), sleep duration <6hr/day (OR=1.80, P<0.001, 95% CI=1.38-2.34), study duration >8hr/day (OR=1.21, P=0.02, 95% CI=1.03-1.42), and quantity of homework higher than before (OR=1.68, P<0.001, 95% CI=1.40-2.02) were positively associated with anxiety; the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at a provincial level of 100-999 (OR=0.70, P<0.001, 95% CI=0.59-0.83) and 1,000-9,999 (OR=0.69, P=0.001, 95% CI=0.55-0.87) were negatively related to anxiety in adolescents with depression. Limitations Because this was a cross-sectional online study, the causality between variables and anxiety could not be examined among depressed adolescents. The use of self-reported scales may lead to an underestimation of the proportion of anxiety among adolescents with depression. Conclusions The symptoms of anxiety were common in adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 outbreak.

141,Increased alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic: The effect of mental health and age in a cross-sectional sample of social media users in the U.S.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a public health crisis of unprecedented scale. Increased alcohol use has been extensively documented during other crises, particularly among persons with anxiety and depression. Despite COVID-19's differential impact by age, the association of age, mental health and alcohol use during the pandemic has not been explored. This study aimed to examine whether age modified the association of anxiety and depressive symptoms with alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two online surveys were administered to U.S. adult social media users in March and April 2020. Generalized linear models were conducted in 2020 among 5850 respondents (52.9% female; 22.0% aged 18–39 years, 47.0% aged 40–59 years, and 31.0% aged ≥60 years) to examine if age modified the association of anxiety and depression symptomatology and alcohol use. Overall, 29% of respondents reported increased alcohol use. Adjusted odds ratios of reporting increased alcohol use were 1.41 (95% CI = 1.20–1.66) among respondents with anxiety symptoms and 1.64 (95% CI = 1.21–2.23) among those with depressive symptoms compared to those without such symptoms. Whereas respondents aged 18–39 years had the highest probability of reporting increased alcohol use, the probability of older persons (40–59 and ≥60 years) reporting increased drinking was much greater among those with symptoms of anxiety and depression, compared to those without symptoms. These findings warrant age-differentiated public health messaging on the risks of excessive alcohol use and scale-up of substance use services for middle-aged and older adults with symptoms of depression and anxiety.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106422,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106422,Scopus,10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106422,2021-04-01,,,
142,"Trajectories of depression, anxiety and pandemic experiences; A longitudinal study of youth in New York during the Spring-Summer of 2020","Initial reports suggest that mental health problems were elevated early in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have followed-up participants as the pandemic evolved and examined both between and within person predictors of symptom trajectories. In the current study, adolescents and young adults (N=532) in New York were surveyed monthly between March 27th and July 14th, 2020, a period spanning the first peak and subsequent decline in COVID-19 infection rates in the region. Surveys assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Child Depression Inventory and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, as well as experiences related to the pandemic. Multilevel growth modeling indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety peaked around late April/early May and then decreased through May-July. Some pandemic experiences followed a similar quadratic trajectory, while others decreased linearly across the study. Specific relationships emerged between some types of pandemic experiences and depression and anxiety symptoms. While symptoms of depression and anxiety in youth may have been elevated early in the pandemic, these findings suggest they subsided across Spring-Summer of 2020, with higher levels of both corresponding to a period of peak infection rates and decreases paralleling the decline in pandemic experiences and COVID-19 infection rates.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113778,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113778,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113778,2021-04-01,,,

The moderating role of employee resilience","The COVID-19 health disaster has had a dramatic impact on the global hospitality industry, affecting millions of people. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of job insecurity on hotel employees’ anxiety and depression, and whether these psychological strains could influence employees’ self-rated task performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also examine the moderating role of hotel employees’ resilience in this context. The hypotheses were examined by collecting data from 353 hotel employees currently working in the Canary Islands (Spain). The results highlight the significant effects of job insecurity on employees’ anxiety and depression levels. However, hotel employees’ task performance was not affected by their job insecurity or by their anxiety and depression. In addition, employees’ resilience has a moderating effect as it reduces the negative influence of job insecurity on depression.

The present study explored the efficacy of a short-term digital group intervention aimed at providing seniors with the tools and skills necessary for improving their coping ability during these stressful times. A total of 82 community-dwelling adults aged between 65 aged 90 (Mage = 72 years, SD = 5.63) were randomized to either an intervention group (n = 64) or a wait-list control group (n = 18). The intervention comprised online guided sessions in small groups in which behavioral and cognitive techniques were learned and practiced via the ZOOM videoconferencing platform. Loneliness and depression levels were measured pre- and post-participation. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in the intervention group in terms of both loneliness and depressive symptoms, compared with the control group. Results of mixed effect models indicated a medium ameliorative effect on loneliness (d = 0.58), while that for depressive symptoms was only marginally significant and smaller in size (d = 0.43).

146,Psychosocial experiences of postnatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic. A UK-wide study of prevalence rates and risk factors for clinically relevant depression and anxiety,"Background When the vulnerabilities of the postnatal period are combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, psychosocial outcomes are likely to be affected. Specifically, we aim to: a) explore the psychosocial experiences of women in the early postnatal period; b) describe prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression; and c) explore whether psychosocial change occurring as a result of COVID-19 is predictive of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression. Methods A sample of UK mothers (N = 614) with infants aged between birth and twelve weeks were recruited via convenience sampling. A cross-sectional survey design was utilised which comprised demographics, COVID-19 specific questions, and a battery of validated psychosocial measures, including the EPDS and STAI-S which were used to collect prevalence rates of clinically relevant depression and anxiety respectively. Data collection coincided with the UK government's initial mandated “lockdown” restrictions and the introduction of social distancing measures in 2020. Findings Descriptive findings from the overall sample indicate that a high percentage of mothers self-reported psychological and social changes as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures. For women who reported the presence of psychosocial change, these changes were perceived negatively. Whilst seventy women (11.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of depression, two hundred and sixty-four women (43%) reported a score of ≥13 on the EPDS, indicating clinically relevant depression. Whilst one hundred and thirteen women (18.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of anxiety, three hundred and seventy-three women (61%) reported a score of ≥40 on STAI-S, indicating clinically relevant anxiety. After accounting for current clinical diagnoses of depression or anxiety, and demographic factors known to influence mental health, only perceived psychological change occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk of clinically relevant maternal depression (30%) and anxiety (33%). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first national study to examine the psychosocial experiences of postnatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety were extremely high when compared to both self-reported current diagnoses of depression and anxiety, and pre-pandemic prevalence studies. Perceived psychological changes occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk for clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety.

Additional aims were to explore memory reconsolidation as a change factor in art therapy. The study examined three- and four-drawing protocols and two resource reminder conditions to evaluate which version of the protocol was most helpful. Significant improvements were found in ratings of pain, depression, anxiety, relationship quality, and helplessness from pre-test to post-test, and in the frequency of experiencing pain, depression, fear, anger, relationship problems, and endorsed resources. There were significant differences between groups for anger, and a time by resource reminder condition interaction effect for fear. Exploratory analyses showed similar results for those who participated in the study before and during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and online versus in-person participation. However, pre-pandemic participants reported an increase in frequency of hopefulness over time, yet participants during the pandemic reported a decrease in frequency of experiencing hopefulness over time. Also, online participants reported a greater decrease in hopefulness frequencies when compared to in-person participants.

149,The COVID-19 outbreak and PNES: The impact of a ubiquitously felt stressor,"Objective We aimed to assess frequency of functional seizures or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) during the COVID-19 outbreak and to recognize possible factors associated with worsening in this population. Methods In this cross-sectional study conducted during the second phase of the pandemic, adult patients with PNES documented by video-EEG and followed up in two tertiary epilepsy centers responded to a structured telephone survey. Data were gathered on demographics, clinical features and frequency of PNES, history of psychiatric comorbidity, access to treatment, as well as on anxiety (GAD-7 items) and depressive symptoms (NDDI-E). Results Fifty-four patients (78% female; mean age of 31.36 years [SD = 10.6]) were contacted and 15 (28%) reported increased frequency of PNES during the pandemic. Higher scores of GAD-7 items ( p < 0.001) and NDDI-E ( p < 0.001) were associated with PNES worsening. There was strong evidence of a correlation between higher stress levels ( p < 0.001) and poor sleep quality ( p 0.005) with PNES aggravation. After regression, stress was the strongest predictor of PNES increased frequency. Significance Patients with functional neurological disorders are vulnerable during ubiquitously felt stressors. However, the atmosphere of uncertainty did not affect these patients equally. Patients with PNES showing symptoms of anxiety and depression are at higher risk of seizure worsening.

151,Reducing the stigma of mental health disorders with a focus on low- and middle-income countries,"Mental health disorders are a burgeoning global public health challenge, and disproportionately affect the poor. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear 80 % of the mental health disease burden. Stigma associated with mental health results in delayed help seeking, reduced access to health services, suboptimal treatment, poor outcomes and an increased risk of individuals’ human rights violations. Moreover, widespread co-occurrence of physical comorbidities such as noncommunicable diseases with mental health disorders makes the treatment of both conditions challenging and worsens prognosis. This paper explores various aspects of stigma towards mental health with a focus on LMICs and assesses measures to increase help-seeking and access to and uptake of mental health services. Stigma impacts persons living with mental illness, their families and caregivers and healthcare professionals (mental health professionals, non-psychiatric specialists and general practitioners) imparting mental health care. Cultural, socio-economic and religious factors determine various aspects of mental health in LMICs, ranging from perceptions of health and illness, health seeking behavior, attitudes of the individuals and health practitioners and mental health systems. Addressing stigma requires comprehensive and inclusive mental health policies and legislations; sustainable and culturally-adapted awareness programs; capacity building of mental health workforce through task-shifting and interprofessional approaches; and improved access to mental health services by integration with primary healthcare and utilizing existing pathways of care. Future strategies targeting stigma reduction must consider the enormous physical comorbidity burden associated with mental health, prioritize workplace interventions and importantly, address the deterioration of population mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102601,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102601,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102601,2021-04-01,,,
152,Induction of stress resistance and extension of lifespan in Chaenorhabditis elegans serotonin-receptor knockout strains by withanolide A,"Introduction Approximately 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression. The COVID-19 crisis may dramatically increase these numbers. Severe side effects and resistance development limit the use of standard antidepressants. The steroidal lactone withanolide A (WA) from Withania somnifera may be a promising alternative. Caenorhabditis elegans was used as model to explore WA's anti-depressive and anti-stress potential. Methods C. elegans wildtype (N2) and deficient strains (AQ866, DA1814, DA2100, DA2109 and MT9772) were used to assess oxidative, osmotic or heat stress as measured by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), determination of lifespan, and mRNA expression of serotonin receptor (ser-1, ser-4, ser-7) and serotonin transporter genes (mod-5). The protective effect of WA was compared to fluoxetine as clinically established antidepressant. Additionally, WA's effect on lifespan was determined. Furthermore, the binding affinities and pKi values of WA, fluoxetine and serotonin as natural ligand to Ser-1, Ser-4, Ser-7, Mod-5 and their human orthologues proteins were calculated by molecular docking. Results Baseline oxidative stress was higher in deficient than wildtype worms. WA and fluoxetine reduced ROS levels in all strains except MT9772. WA and fluoxetine prolonged survival times in wildtype and mutants under osmotic stress. WA but not fluoxetine increased lifespan of all heat-stressed C. elegans strains except DA2100. Furthermore, WA but not fluoxetine extended lifespan in all non-stressed C. elegans strains. WA also induced mRNA expression of serotonin receptors and transporters in wildtype and mutants. WA bound with higher affinity and lower pKi values to all C. elegans and human serotonin receptors and transporters than serotonin, indicating that WA may competitively displaced serotonin from the binding pockets of these proteins. Conclusion WA reduced stress and increased lifespan by ROS scavenging and interference with the serotonin system. Hence, WA may serve as promising candidate to treat depression.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153482,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153482,Scopus,10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153482,2021-04-01,,,
153,Improving racial disparities in unmet palliative care needs among intensive care unit family members with a needs-targeted app intervention: The ICUconnect randomized clinical trial,"Introduction The technologies used to treat the millions who receive care in intensive care unit (ICUs) each year have steadily advanced. However, the quality of ICU-based communication has remained suboptimal, particularly concerning for Black patients and their family members. Therefore we developed a mobile app intervention for ICU clinicians and family members called ICUconnect that assists with delivering need-based care. Objective To describe the methods and early experiences of a clustered randomized clinical trial (RCT) being conducted to compare ICUconnect vs. usual care. Methods and analysis The goal of this two-arm, parallel group clustered RCT is to determine the clinical impact of the ICUconnect intervention in improving outcomes overall and for each racial subgroup on reducing racial disparities in core palliative care outcomes over a 3-month follow up period. ICU attending physicians are randomized to either ICUconnect or usual care, with outcomes obtained from family members of ICU patients. The primary outcome is change in unmet palliative care needs measured by the NEST instrument between baseline and 3 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include goal concordance of care and interpersonal processes of care at 3 days post-randomization; length of stay; as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 months post-randomization. We will use hierarchical linear models to compare outcomes between the ICUconnect and usual care arms within all participants and assess for differential intervention effects in Blacks and Whites by adding a patient-race interaction term. We hypothesize that both compared to usual care as well as among Blacks compared to Whites, ICUconnect will reduce unmet palliative care needs, psychological distress and healthcare resource utilization while improving goal concordance and interpersonal processes of care. In this manuscript, we also describe steps taken to adapt the ICUconnect intervention to the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare setting. Enrollment status A total of 36 (90%) of 40 ICU physicians have been randomized and 83 (52%) of 160 patient-family dyads have been enrolled to date. Enrollment will continue until the end of 2021.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2021.106319,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2021.106319,Scopus,10.1016/j.cct.2021.106319,2021-04-01,,,

155,Suicidality among healthcare professionals during the first COVID19 wave,"Background Prevalence estimates of suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB) among clinically active healthcare professionals during the first wave of COVID19 pandemic are non-existing. The main aim of this study was to investigate the 30-day prevalence of STB and associated risk factors. Methods As part of the Recovering Emotionally from COVID study (RECOVID), 30-day STB among healthcare professionals (N = 6,409) was assessed in an e-survey in healthcare settings in Belgium. The prevalence of STB and associated risk factors were estimated in multivariable models with individual-level and society-level measures of association. We used post-stratification weights to make the data representative for the entire clinical workforce in Belgium. Results Prevalence was 3.6% death wish, 1.5% suicide ideation, 1.0% suicide plan, and 0.0% suicide attempt. Thirty-day STB was (a) increased among respondents with lifetime and current mental disorders (mostly depression) and those hospitalized for COVID19 infection, (b) decreased among respondents with social support, and (c) unrelated to work environment. Limitations This is an explorative cross-sectional study using multivariate models that generates specific hypotheses on the prevalence of and risk factors for STB during the COVID19 pandemic rather than testing specific pathways that lead to STB onset. Conclusions Across age, gender, professional discipline, and exposure to COVID, lifetime and current mental disorders were highly associated with STB. These factors could guide governments and healthcare organizations in taking up responsibilities in preventing emotional problems and developing resilience among healthcare professionals during, but probably beyond, the current COVID19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.013,2021-03-15,,,
156,The psychological impact of COVID-19 and restrictive measures in the world,"Background In a short time, the COVID-19 pandemic turned into a global emergency. The fear of becoming infected and the lockdown measures have drastically changed people's daily routine. The aim of this study is to establish the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is entailing, particularly with regards to levels of stress, anxiety and depression, and to the risks of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Methods The study, carried out with a sample of 1612 subjects distributed in seven countries (Australia, China, Ecuador, Iran, Italy, Norway and the United States), allowed us to collect information about the psychological impact of COVID-19. Results The findings of this study show that the levels of stress, depression and anxiety, as well as the risks of PTSD, are higher than average in over half of the considered sample. The severity of these disorders significantly depends on gender, type of outdoor activities, characteristics of their homes, eventual presence of infected acquaintances, time dedicated to looking for related information (in the news and social networks), type of source information and, in part, to the level of education and income. Conclusions We conclude that COVID-19 has a very strong psychological impact on the global population. This appears to be linked to the coping strategies adopted, level of mindful awareness, socio-demographic variables, people's habits and the way individuals use means of communication and information.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.020,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.020,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.020,2021-03-15,,,
157,Resilience and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Resilience is a process that allows recovery from or adaptation to adversities. The aim of this study was to evaluate state resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in psychiatric patients (PP), unaffected relatives (UR) and community controls (CC). Methods: This study is part of the Barcelona ResIlience Survey for Mental Health COVID-19 (BRIS-MHC) project. Logistic regression models were performed to identify mental health outcomes associated with bad state resilience and predictors of good state resilience. The association between state resilience and specific affective temperaments as well as their influence on the association between depressive symptoms and state resilience were verified. Results: The study recruited 898 participants that took part in the survey. The presence of depressive symptoms was a predictor of bad state resilience in PP (β=0.110, OR=1.117, p=0.028). No specific mental health outcome was associated with bad state resilience in UR and CC. Predictors of good state resilience in PP were having pursued hobbies/conducted home tasks (β=1.261, OR=3.528, p=0.044) and level of organization in the family (β=0.986, OR=2.682, p=0.008). Having a controlling family was inversely associated with good state resilience in CC (β=-1.004, OR=0.367, p=0.012). The association between bad state resilience and depressive symptoms was partially mediated by affective temperaments. Limitations: Participants self-reported their psychiatric diagnoses, their relatives’ diagnoses or the absence of a psychiatric disorder, as well as their psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Enhancing resilience and coping strategies in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic might have important implications in terms of mental health outcomes.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.055,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.055,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.055,2021-03-15,,,
158,Innate Inhibiting Proteins Enhance Expression and Immunogenicity of Self-Amplifying RNA,"Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a cutting-edge platform for both nucleic acid vaccines and therapeutics. saRNA is self-adjuvanting, as it activates types I and III interferon (IFN), which enhances the immunogenicity of RNA vaccines but can also lead to inhibition of translation. In this study, we screened a library of saRNA constructs with cis-encoded innate inhibiting proteins (IIPs) and determined the effect on protein expression and immunogenicity. We observed that the PIV-5 V and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ORF4a proteins enhance protein expression 100- to 500-fold in vitro in IFN-competent HeLa and MRC5 cells. We found that the MERS-CoV ORF4a protein partially abates dose nonlinearity in vivo, and that ruxolitinib, a potent Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibitor, but not the IIPs, enhances protein expression of saRNA in vivo. Both the PIV-5 V and MERS-CoV ORF4a proteins were found to enhance the percentage of resident cells in human skin explants expressing saRNA and completely rescued dose nonlinearity of saRNA. Finally, we observed that the MERS-CoV ORF4a increased the rabies virus (RABV)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) by ∼10-fold in rabbits, but not in mice or rats. These experiments provide a proof of concept that IIPs can be directly encoded into saRNA vectors and effectively abate the nonlinear dose dependency and enhance immunogenicity.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.11.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.11.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.11.011,2021-03-03,,,
159,The psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions associated with severe infections of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses,"Introduction It is known that viral infections are epidemiologically prevalent and some of them are harmful to the central nervous system (CNS) due to the development of neuropsychiatric syndromes which affect the cognitive, affective, behavioral and perceptual domains. Objective To carry out a comprehensive analysis of the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions of COVID-19 based on epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical foundations observed in previous and recent pandemic events, and also to make a proposition about effective therapeutic interventions to help tackle this serious public health problem, more specifically in its neuropsychiatric developments. Method This current literature review has utilized literature reserves and scientific search engines MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. The search terms included, “SARS-CoV-2”, “etiology,” “psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions”, “severe infections” “COVID-19”. Specific choices of unique papers from each of the searches were identified. The inclusion criteria were relevance and availability of full-text. Papers were excluded on the basis of relevance and non-availability of full-text. Papers were identified in the general literature reserve as pertinent to the search terms. Results The main psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions analyzed were depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis, nonspecific neurological symptoms, delirium, cerebrovascular complications, encephalopathies, neuromuscular disorders, anosmia and ageusia. Conclusion The psychiatric and neuropsychiatric symptoms of acute respiratory syndromes can appear during or after the infectious stage. Among the risk factors pointed out for such effects are the female gender, health professionals, presence of avascular necrosis and distressing pain.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110159,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110159,Scopus,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110159,2021-03-02,,,

161,Self-harm during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic in England: Comparative trend analysis of hospital presentations,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures necessary to address it may have major effects on mental health, including on self-harm. We have used well-established monitoring systems in two hospitals in England to investigate trends in self-harm presentations to hospitals during the early period of the pandemic. Method: Data collected in Oxford and Derby on patients aged 18 years and over who received a psychosocial assessment after presenting to the emergency departments following self-harm were used to compare trends during the three-month period following lockdown in the UK (23rd March 2020) to the period preceding lockdown and the equivalent period in 2019. Results: During the 12 weeks following introduction of lockdown restrictions there was a large reduction in the number of self-harm presentations to hospitals by individuals aged 18 years and over compared to the pre-lockdown weeks in 2020 (mean weekly reduction of 13.5 (95% CI 5.6 - 21.4) and the equivalent period in 2019 (mean weekly reduction of 18.0 (95% CI 13.9 - 22.1). The reduction was greater in females than males, occurred in all age groups, with a larger reduction in presentations following self-poisoning than self-injury. Conclusions: A substantial decline in hospital presentations for self-harm occurred during the three months following the introduction of lockdown restrictions. Reasons could include a reduction in self-harm at the community level and individuals avoiding presenting to hospital following self-harm. Longer-term monitoring of self-harm behaviour during the pandemic is essential, together with efforts to encourage help-seeking and the modification of care provision.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.015,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.015,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.015,2021-03-01,,,

163,Ketamine's rapid antisuicidal effects are not attenuated by Buprenorphine,"Ketamine's rapid antisuicidal action has gathered significant clinical interest in treatment of depression though concerns exist that its actions occur through the Opioid pathway. A recent study additionally reported that Naltrexone blocks antisuicidal effects of Ketamine suggesting that its antisuicidal effects are also due to opioid mechanisms. We present a case of treatment refractory depression with recent suicide attempt and active suicidal ideations who was on an Opioid partial agonist, Buprenorphine, for management of pain. Patient responded to a trial of IV ketamine treatment with rapid improvement in suicidal thoughts. Patient's suicidal ideations decreased after first Ketamine treatment and resolved after second treatment while maintained on Buprenorphine. Our finding shows that Buprenorphine does not block Ketamine's effects on suicidal ideations and therefore Ketamine treatment could be provided safely in controlled environment to those with substance use disorders or with chronic pain while being maintained on Buprenorphine. Additionally, our case suggests that non-Opioid mechanisms may be involved in Ketamine's antidepressant effects and its response to suicidal ideations in those on Opioid partial agonists.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.120,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.120,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.120,2021-03-01,,,

This study aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -associated epidemiology and clinical outcomes in Bangladesh in order to understand the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic and develop approaches to prevention. A cross-sectional study based on retrospective interviews was conducted on 1021 individuals with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted in six different hospitals in Bangladesh and who recovered 4 weeks before the interview date. Of the 1021 patients, 111 (10.9%) were asymptomatic and the other 910 (89.1%) were symptomatic. Higher prevalence of COVID-19 was found in the male population (75%), in cohorts with B-positive blood group (36.3%) and in the 31–40 years age group. Common symptoms observed in our study participants were fever (72.4%), cough (55.9%), loss of taste (40.7%) and body ache (40%); whereas among the biochemical parameters, neutrophil count (46.4%), D-dimer (46.1%) and ferritin (37.9%) levels were elevated. Among the recovered individuals, short-term outcomes including pains and aches (31.8%), weakened attention span (24.4%) and anxiety or depression (23.1%) were also significantly prevalent in the symptomatic cases with comorbidities. Our study showed that in Bangladesh, adult males aged between 31 and 40 years were more vulnerable to developing COVID-19. It also indicated a rising trend of asymptomatic cases as the pandemic progressed.

Methods The subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The subjects were asked to open their mouth to make “ah” sound (traditional method) or simulate yawn (improved method) for throat swab collection. The usage of tongue depressor, collection time, adverse reactions and subjective discomfort (VAS score) were compared. The collection time, comprehensive indicators of adverse reactions and VAS score were also compared among three collectors. Results The tongue depressor was less used in the improved group (χ2 = 40.186, P < 0.01). The average collection time of the traditional group was 5.44 ± 2.97 and that of the improved group was 4.00 ± 2.31 (P < 0.01). The subjects in the improved group had fewer and milder adverse reactions. The VAS score of subjects in the improved group was lower than that in the traditional group (P < 0.01).

Mobile mental care applications (apps) comprise a form of online mental care that enables the delivery of remote mental care. Objectives This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of university students in Spain and to explore their attitudes toward the use of mobile mental care apps. Method Respondents answered a survey, which comprised two sections. The first included the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) that was employed to assess the students’ mental health. The second section included six questions developed by the authors to explore the students’ attitudes toward mental care apps. Results The results showed that the students suffered from anxiety and depression as well as social dysfunction. Further, 91.3 % of the students had never used a mobile app for mental health, 36.3 % were unaware of such apps, and 79.2 % were willing to use them in the future.

Individuals with early life adversity (ELA) may be more susceptible to those psychological stresses during this epidemic. Aims To measure the effect of the ELA on acute stress reactions, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to examine whether specific trauma types and frequencies of exposure are associated with a more severe acute stress reaction and increased risk of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Method This investigation was performed at college students in a comprehensive University of China. The online self-report questionnaire included ELA experiences, exposure to epidemic-related events, acute stress reactions, and anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Logistic regression and stepwise regression were used to assess the associations and interactions among these variables. Results Participants with ELA reported more exposure to epidemic-related events and more severe stress reactions during the epidemics than did those with no ELA. The experience of ELA is associated with acute stress reactions, anxiety and depression in early adulthood. Furthermore, experiencing more ELA during childhood may not only increase the risk of anxiety and depression episode in early adulthood but also lead to more severe acute stress reactions during the epidemic. Conclusion Regardless of specific ELA types, ELAs have longer time effects on individual's susceptibility to stress. Under this epidemic, the mental health in young adults with ELA needs more attention.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.126,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.126,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.126,2021-03-01,,,
172,Unprecedented need and recommendations for harnessing data to guide future policy and practice for opioid use disorder treatment following COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic struck in the midst of an ongoing opioid epidemic. To offset disruption to life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), several federal agencies granted exemptions to existing federal regulations. This included loosening restrictions on medications for OUD (MOUD), including methadone and buprenorphine. In this commentary, we briefly review policy and practice guidelines for treating OUD prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We then outline specific MOUD treatment policy and practice exemptions that went into effect in February and March 2020, and discuss the ways in which these unprecedented changes have dramatically changed MOUD treatment.

175,The mental health and lifestyle impacts of COVID-19 on bipolar disorder,"Background It is unclear how those with bipolar disorder (BD) have been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to obtain a more detailed understanding of the current mental health needs of these individuals, which is important for both the development of intervention strategies to better manage patient distress and to better prepare for similar circumstances in future. Methods The sample comprised 43 individuals with a verified diagnosis of BD and 24 healthy controls. Data about pandemic-related mental health support use, socio-demographics, mood, lifestyle, social rhythm and subjective cognitive dysfunction data were collected and compared between groups. Inter-relationships between scores were also examined. Results No between-group differences were found in terms of age, sex, living situation, job loss or reduced work hours due to COVID-19. Most patients with BD reported a history of ongoing formal psychological support (68.3%), with most continuing this support throughout the pandemic (82.1%). A large, statistically significant pandemic-related increase in subjective cognitive dysfunction was evident in the BD group. Subjective cognitive dysfunction was significantly associated with negative symptomology, suicidal thoughts, and quality of life ratings. Limitations Data was collected in self-report format in an online survey and objective symptom measures were not used at this time Conclusion The absenceof substantial differences between patients and controls in terms of mood symptoms, COVID-19 fear or lifestyle factors and social rhythms suggests a degree of resilience in BD patients; despite large pandemic related increases in subjective cognitive dysfunction.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.186,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.186,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.186,2021-03-01,,,
176,Correlation between depressive symptoms and sexual dysfunction in postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective To evaluate the relation between sexual function and depressive symptoms in puerperal women during the pandemic period. Study design Prospective cohort with 125 women evaluated in the immediate postpartum period (before the pandemic - T1) in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, 3 months (pandemic onset - T2) and 6 months (pandemic peak - T3) after birth by email and WhatsApp. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were applied. Results Fifty puerperal women participated in the three periods of the study. The median age was 25 years. There was an inverse correlation between the ​​ FSFI and EPDS values at T2 (p < 0.001) and T3 (p < 0.001), demonstrating that the worsening sexual response was secondary to the higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in the puerperium in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an increase in EPDS scores in the three periods: at T1, the EPDS scores ​​were 5.0 (2.0−9.0), increasing to 7.0 (4.0−14.0) at T2 and 6.5 (3.0−13.0) at T3 (p = 0.004). There was no difference between the FSFI index at the three evaluated times. Conclusions Puerperal women are a susceptible subgroup for sexual dysfunction and depressive symptoms, which are correlated to each other and worsen in periods of stress, therefore, it is mandatory to investigate depressive symptoms in puerperal women with sexual complaints, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.12.039,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.12.039,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.12.039,2021-03-01,,,

Medical staff around the world are nervously responding to the crisis, and their mental health problems deserve attention. To better know the differences in the mental health status between frontier-line and non-frontier-line medical staff. This study used the Child PTSD Symptom Scale, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale to examine the PTSD, depression, anxiety and resilience among 162 frontier-line medical workers and 163 non-frontier-line medical workers in China. The results showed that all negative factor scores of non-frontier-line medical staff seemed to be worse than those of frontier-line medical staff, and the positive factor scores were the opposite through descriptive analysis, independent sample t-test and Chi-square test.

184,"Pyometra Management Practices in the High Quality, High Volume Spay-Neuter Environment","Pyometra management in the high quality, high volume spay-neuter (HQHVSN) environment is not well documented. The goal of this study was to identify pyometra management practices and patient outcomes in the HQHVSN environment. An electronic survey was piloted and distributed to HQHVSN clinics using Survey Monkey via email lists and social media. A total of 118 responses were received from June to July 2020. Respondents were distributed across the United States with the majority of clinics associated with a shelter (75%). Clinics performed a median of 25 spays and neuters per day and 5000 per year. Most clinics (86%) were willing to treat nonincidental pyometras at least sometimes, and nearly all of these clinics (97%) were willing to accept pyometra referrals. Of these clinics, nearly all (95%) felt they had the necessary resources to treat most pyometras that presented and that a pyometra case was only modestly disruptive to their surgery flow. Most clinics (70%) charged a fee for treatment, charging a median of $200 for dogs and $125 for cats. This is much lower as compared to the estimated ranges for private practice ($600-$2500) and emergency hospitals ($1500-$3579). The majority of patients that HQHVSN clinics accepted for treatment were seen the same day (50%) or next day (42%). These clinics estimated that of the animals who presented, 76% were BAR or QAR, 20% were depressed or nonambulatory, and 4% were obtunded and lateral. Estimated survival for these treated groups were 98%, 80%, and 38%, respectively. HQHVSN clinics may represent a resource for treating pyometras when treatment is disruptive to the schedule of a private practice or clients present with financial limitations. There is an opportunity for HQHVSN and private practice to form a partnership to leverage the strengths of both models and improve access to care for pets.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2020.100499,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2020.100499,Scopus,10.1016/j.tcam.2020.100499,2021-03-01,,,
185,Anxiety and depression due to 2019 SARS-CoV-2 among frontier healthcare workers in Kenya,"Background The novel coronavirus disease continues to spread across the globe, causing anxiety and depression among healthcare workers. Objectives The current study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and depression due to the coronavirus pandemic among healthcare workers in Kenya. Methods A total sample of 476 respondents participated. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Patient-Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), together with a socio-demographic questionnaire, were applied. Stratified sampling was used. Data was analysed using the Statistical Package Programme for Social Science Version 23.0.0. Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were employed to establish the differences in levels of anxiety and depression across socio-demographic characteristics. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to establish the predictors of levels of anxiety and depression, and associations were considered significant at p < 0.05. Results A total of 35.1% (n = 167) of the participants had mild anxiety, and 13.4% (n = 64) severe anxiety. Approximately 53.6% (n = 255) had mild depression while 9.2% (n = 44) had severe depression. The univariate analysis illustrated a statistical difference in anxiety levels in gender (p > 0.027), years of work experience (p = 0.005), and the cadre of respondents (p = 0.0028). Gender was statistically significant with the level of depression (p = 0.045). About 62.6% (n = 298) of healthcare workers had been trained, and only 9% (n = 43) were confident in managing COVID-19 cases. A large proportion, 98% (n = 458) had concerns about the availability of personal protective equipment. Conclusion The study findings indicated that the majority of healthcare workers had mild anxiety and depression. Female healthcare workers were more likely to experience severe anxiety and depression. Also, levels of anxiety and depression differed across different cadres of healthcare workers.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06351,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06351,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06351,2021-03-01,,,
186,Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on nurses’ mental health: A prospective cohort study,"Objectives To evaluate variations in nurses’ sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to evaluate whether the presence of potential risk factors influenced these symptoms over time. Methods This prospective cohort study surveyed nurses three times – surveying personal factors, working conditions, family dynamics, and attitude towards COVID-19 – between March 31 and May 4, 2020. Nurses’ mental health was assessed through Depression Anxiety Stress Scales – short version (DASS-21); their sleep quality was assessed through a 5-point Likert scale question. Results Nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress presented a positive variation over the COVID-19 outbreak. The only factors which are directly related to the COVID-19 outbreak and that were associated with the positive variation in nurses’ symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were the fear to infect others and the fear to be infected (higher fear of being infected or to infect someone corresponded to increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress). Conclusions Although the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have had an immediate impact on nurses' mental health, a psychological adaptation phenomenon was also observed. Future research should focus on assessing nurses’ symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, after the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to compare and contrast the findings with the results of our study.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110620,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110620,Scopus,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110620,2021-03-01,,,
187,Association between psychological resilience and changes in mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background Psychological responses to potentially traumatic events tend to be heterogeneous, with some individuals displaying resilience. Longitudinal associations between resilience and mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to examine the association between resilience and trajectories of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Participants were 6,008 adults from the Understanding America Study, a probability-based Internet-panel representative of the US adult population. Baseline data were collected between March 10 and March 31, 2020, with nine follow-up waves conducted between April 1 and August 4. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to examine the association between date and mental distress, stratified by resilience level (low, normal, or high). Results In contrast to the high resilience group, participants in the low and normal resilience groups experienced increases in mental distress in the early months of the pandemic (low: OR=2.94, 95% CI=1.93-4.46; normal: OR=1.91, 95% CI=1.55-2.35). Men, middle-aged and older adults, Black adults, and adults with a graduate degree were more likely to report high resilience, whereas adults living below the poverty line were less likely to report high resilience. Limitations These associations should not be interpreted as causal, and resilience was measured at only one time-point. Conclusions Trajectories of mental distress varied markedly by resilience level during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with low-resilience adults reporting the largest increases in mental distress during this crisis. Activities that foster resilience should be included in broader strategies to support mental health throughout the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.071,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.071,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.071,2021-03-01,,,
188,"A longitudinal study on clinically relevant self-reported depression, anxiety and acute stress features among Italian community-dwelling adults during the COVID-19 related lockdown: Evidence of a predictive role for baseline dysfunctional personality dimensions","Background: Although necessary for public health, quarantine has been documented to cause post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression. We designed the present longitudinal study to evaluate the psychological impact of quarantine in Italian community-dwelling adult participants. Methods: A sample of 304 Italian community-dwelling adult participants (75.7% female; mean age = 35.28 years) was administered self-reported measures of depression, anxiety and acute stress symptoms at the beginning and at the end of the lockdown. Potential predictors of clinically relevant symptoms at the end of the lockdown were assessed. Specifically, data on gender, civil status, education level, occupation, and area of residence, as well as maladaptive personality domains were collected. Results: More than 43% of participants suffered from the early impact of the lockdown; at the end of the lockdown roughly 32% of participants still reported any clinically relevant depression anxiety, and/or acute stress disorder condition. Clinically relevant acute stress reaction at the beginning of lockdown was a particularly important risk factor for experiencing clinically relevant acute stress, depression, and anxiety at the end of the lockdown. Maladaptive personality domains represent non-trivial predictors of participants’ self-reports of clinically relevant depression, anxiety, and acute stress conditions at the end of the lockdown. Limitations: Excess of female participants and the impossibility of evaluating if participants suffered from any internalizing disorder before the COVID-19 quarantine represent major limitations of our study. Conclusions: Our findings suggest assessment of internalizing disorder symptoms during quarantine may be helpful in identifying people who may benefit from early treatment interventions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.165,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.165,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.165,2021-03-01,,,
189,The role of only-child status in the psychological impact of COVID-19 on mental health of Chinese adolescents,"Background The impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on public mental health in 2019 is verified, but the role of only-child status in the mental health of adolescents confined at home during the COVID-19 epidemic has not been investigated and is not clear. Objective Our study aims to assess the impact of only-child status on the mental health of adolescents confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The exposure risk to COVID-19, adverse experience, parent-child relationship, and resilience have also been measured and considered. Methods From March 20 to 31, 2020, a cross-sectional survey test was conducted on 11,681 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years in middle schools (Grade 7 to Grade 9) across five provinces in China. The self-reported online questionnarie was used to collected data of demographic information, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the exposure risk to COVID-19. Results A total of 11,180 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective rate of 95.7%. 35.2% of only children and 38.8% of non-only children reported depression symptoms, while 20.5% of only children and 24.7% of non-only children reported anxiety symptoms. It was significant that non-only children were more likely to have anxiety and depression symptoms than only children (OR = 1.164, 95%CI: 1.064–1.273, p = 0.001). The risk of exposure to COVID-19 was a risk factor of depression (OR = 2.284, 95%CI: 1.640–3.180, p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.959, 95%CI: 1.402–2.737, p < 0.001) in non-only children, but not in only children. For both only children and non-only children, the resilience and parent-child relationship were protective factors of depression and anxiety symptoms, while emotional abuse was a risk factor (p < 0.001). Conclusion The non-only children are more likely to develop the symptoms of anxiety and depression than only children, during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The adolescents with siblings are psychiatrically more vulnerable to exposure risk of COVID-19 and need more attention, especially those with poor parent-child relationship, low resilience and experience of emotional abuse.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.113,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.113,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.113,2021-03-01,,,
190,"Impact of COVID-19 on the lives and psychosocial well-being of persons with epilepsy during the third trimester of the pandemic: Results from an international, online survey","Objective To evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures on the lives and psychosocial well-being of persons with epilepsy (PWE) during the third trimester of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A structured questionnaire investigating different aspects of the lives and psychosocial well-being of PWE during the COVID-19 pandemic was developed. Persons with epilepsy were invited via social media to anonymously respond to a secure web-based online questionnaire (www.icpcovid.com). Responses were collected between July 26th and December 3rd, 2020. Hospital anxiety and depression scales (HADS) were used to screen respondents for depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A). Results Responses of 407 PWE were included in the analysis; 304 (74.7%) respondents were female and 245 (60.2%) living in Europe, 157 (38.6%) in South America, and 5 (1.2%) in Canada. Seventy-six (18.7%) reported a decrease of income during the COVID-19 lockdown, and 122 (30.0%) experienced difficulties in obtaining anti-seizure medication (ASM), mostly (72/122, 59.0%) due to unavailability. Seizure frequency increased in 122 (30.0%); 295 (72.5%) screened positive for anxiety, and 159 (39.1%) for depression. Hundred eighty-eight (46.2%) reported reluctance to seek medical care; 27.3% believed that epilepsy was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 disease. Forty-six (74.2%) of 62 PWE who were followed up by telephone or video consult were satisfied with this consult. Fifty-five respondents, most (89.1%) of whom were from Europe, had also participated in a previous survey during the early months of the pandemic. In this subgroup, although there was no difference in prevalence of a positive screening for depression or anxiety, mean scores on HADS-A and HADS-D increased from 6.65 ± 3.99 to 7.27 ± 4.01 (p = 0.418), and from 5.84 ± 4.43 to 6.60 ± 4.45 (p = 0.371), respectively. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the psychosocial and somatic well-being of PWE. To minimize this impact, ensuring uninterrupted access to ASM is essential. Teleconsultations are valid alternatives for continued follow-up, but should include attention to psychosocial well-being. Persons with epilepsy should be more actively informed that epilepsy is not a risk factor for developing (more severe) COVID-19 disease.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107800,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107800,Scopus,10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107800,2021-03-01,,,
191,Is necessity also the mother of implementation? COVID-19 and the implementation of evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorders,"Opioid-related overdoses and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represent two of the deadliest crises in United States' history and together constitute a syndemic. The intersecting risks of this syndemic underscore the urgent need to implement effective opioid use disorder (OUD) treatments that are sustainable amid COVID-19 mitigation strategies. In response to new federal guidance released during the pandemic, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) have quickly innovated to implement new systems of medication delivery. OTPs rapid implementation of new medication delivery models defies conventional wisdom about the pace of research transfer. As part of an ongoing cluster-randomized type 3 hybrid trial evaluating strategies to implement contingency management (CM), select staff of eight OTPs had been trained to deliver CM and were in the midst of receiving ongoing implementation support. As COVID-19 emerged, all eight OTPs mirrored trends in the addiction field and effectively adapted to federal/state demands to implement new methods of medication delivery. However, over the past few months, necessity has arguably been the mother of implementation. We have observed greater variance among these OTPs' success with the additional implementation of adjunctive CM. The speed and variability of innovation raises novel questions about drivers of implementation. We argue that the mother of the next innovation should be a public call for a progressive, thoughtful set of public health policies and other external setting levers to address the needs of those with OUD and the OTPs that serve them.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108210,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108210,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108210,2021-03-01,,,

193,Psychological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on the staff of a French hospital,"Background The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among hospital staff. The factors associated with this psychological impact remain to be determined. Methods A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire completed by the staff of a French hospital, two months after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Results Among the 353 participants (of whom 67% were healthcare professionals), 32% had symptoms of anxiety, 16% of depression and 16% of PTSD. Eleven per cent had initiated or increased treatment with sleeping pills, and 6% with anxiolytics. In a multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with anxiety were: change of professional team, having a relative infected by SARS-CoV-2 and a new/increased treatment with sleeping pills or anxiolytics. The only factor associated with depression was the feeling of risk during professional practice. The factors associated with PTSD were: having a relative infected by SARS-CoV-2, the feeling of risk during professional practice, the increase in smoking and treatment with sleeping pills. The observance of transmission preventive measures (TPM) was not associated with the psychological impact of SARS-CoV-2. A personal history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and age<36 years were associated with insufficient use of protective equipment. Age<36 years, and being a healthcare professional were associated with the non-observance of social distancing. Conclusion The hospital staff displayed psychological consequences, resulting in the use of anxiolytics and sleeping pills.

The present paper aims at analysing the impact of suspicious of SARS-COV-2 infection in a cohort of parents presented at 3 major hospitals (spread between north and center of Italy) during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic phase 1. Methods Participants of the present cross-sectional, multicenter study were parental couples of children suspected to have COVID-19 who underwent testing with nasopharyngeal swabbing. All subjects were assessed by means of the: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in order to evaluate Post-traumatic stress (PTSS), anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively. Outcomes Results evidenced that parents whose children tested positive for COVID-19 were more prone to developing PTSS, anxiety and depressive symptoms. The same results emerged for parents who had quarantined as opposed to those who had not. Moreover, patients who suffered economic damage showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas PTSS was more common among unemployed subjects and among mothers.

196,Potential predictors of depressive symptoms during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak among Brazilian adults,"Background In early 2020, Sars-Cov-2 was identified in China as a new coronavirus. Due to its transmission, Sars-Cov-2 has spread rapidly across the world. In the early stage of the disease outbreak, psychiatric symptoms have been reported, including depressive symptoms. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in quarantine and its association with sociodemographic variables and known protective factors for depression, such as spirituality, social support, resilience, and quality of life. Methods A cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was distributed via social media. The instruments consisted of the 8-item EUROHIS-QOL, PHQ-9, Social Support Questionnaire, WHOQoL-SRPB, and CD-RISC. Results A total of 3,274 participants were included in this study. 23.67% of the participants met the criteria for a depressive episode. Higher age, spirituality, social support, resiliency, and quality of life were associated with less depressive symptoms. Quarantine length; mental health treatment; chronic disease; age; sex; lower levels of spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, physical exercise, and education; and unpaid occupation were found to be predictors of depressive symptoms during COVID-19 quarantine. Limitations The data are limited to the pandemic initial period, the sample isn't random and the use of self-reported questionnaires are some limitations of our study. Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil, quarantine time, treatment for mental health, chronic illness, lower levels of education, and unpaid occupation were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Age, sex, spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, and physical exercise showed a negative relationship with depressive symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.203,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.203,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.203,2021-03-01,,,

200,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in a cohort of myasthenia gravis patients in India,"Objective Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness due to immune mediated damage of acetylcholine receptor (AchR). COVID-19 infection, mental stress and non-availability of drugs following lockdown may worsen myasthenic symptoms. We report the impact of COVID 19, and lockdown on the physical and mental health, and quality of sleep in a cohort of MG. Methods Thirty-eight MG patients were telephonically interviewed 2months after the declaration of lockdown in India. The difficulty in procuring drugs, complications, and worsening in the MG Foundation of America (MGFA) stage were noted. The patients were enquired about MG Quality of Life 15 (MGQOL15), MG Activity of Daily Living (MGADL), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) using a prefixed questionnaire. Their pre-COVID parameters were retrieved from our earlier trial data, which was completed 4months back. The scores of the above mentioned parameters before and after COVID were compared. Results Their median age was 45 years, and the median duration of treatment for MG was 4.5years. Eleven (28.9 %) patients were hypertensive and 3(7.9 %) diabetic. All were on prednisolone and 18(47.4 %) received azathioprine. None developed COVID, but three had other infections. Two patients needed hospitalization because of wrong medication in one and severe anxiety-insomnia in another. Following COVID19 and lockdown, MG patients had worsening in MGQOL15, MGADL, HADS and PSQI scores. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score correlated with MGQOL15 and dose of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors. Conclusion COVID-19 and lockdown were associated with anxiety, depression, poor MGQOL and sleep especially in severe MG patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106488,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106488,Scopus,10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106488,2021-03-01,,,

202,Prevalence and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (COVID-D): a multicentre cohort study,"Background To date, 750 000 patients with COVID-19 worldwide have required mechanical ventilation and thus are at high risk of acute brain dysfunction (coma and delirium). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae. Methods This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression. Findings Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40·0 (30·0 to 53·0). 1397 (66·9%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87·5%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64·0%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 12·0) and 1481 (70·9%) were given propofol for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 11·0). Median Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was –4 (–5 to –3). 1704 (81·6%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10·0 days (6·0 to 15·0) and 1147 (54·9%) were delirious for a median of 3·0 days (2·0 to 6·0). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p≤0·04), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p<0·0001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5·0 days (0·0 to 14·0). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p<0·01). 601 (28·8%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU. Interpretation Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Benzodiazepine use and lack of family visitation were identified as modifiable risk factors for delirium, and thus these data present an opportunity to reduce acute brain dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.

204,Suicidal Ideation Among Individuals Who Have Purchased Firearms During COVID-19,"Introduction Given the increase in firearm purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study seeks to determine the extent to which COVID-19 firearm purchasers differ in terms of suicide risk from nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. Methods Participants (N=3,500) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels to participate in an online survey examining methods for self-protection. ANCOVAs were utilized to assess suicidal ideation. Multivariate ANCOVAs were used to examine firearm storage practices and storage changes during COVID-19. Data were collected in late June and early July 2020, and analyses were conducted in July 2020. Results Individuals who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 more frequently reported lifetime, past-year, and past-month suicidal ideation than nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. COVID-19 purchasers with lifetime ideation were less likely to hide loaded firearms in a closet than those without lifetime ideation. COVID-19 purchasers with past-year or past-month ideation were more likely to use locking devices than COVID-19 purchasers without past-month ideation. Conclusions In contrast to firearm owners more generally, COVID-19 firearm purchasers appear far more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and appear less likely to use certain unsafe firearm storage methods but also report a greater number of storage changes during COVID-19 that made firearms less secure. Future research should seek to further understand those who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 and determine ways to increase secure storage among firearm owners.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.013,2021-03-01,,,
205,"Suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown in Greece: Prevalence in the community, risk and protective factors","The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the community as well as the risk and protective factors of suicidal ideation during restriction measures in Greece, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Α web-based anonymous survey was conducted during the first lockdown period. Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation (SCORE-15), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISK-2), and a self-report questionnaire for COVID-19 pandemic-related data. From a total of 5,116 adults included in the study, 5.20% reported suicidal thoughts, 14.17% were potential clinical cases of anxiety, and 26.51% of depression. Participants presented significantly higher suicidal ideation rates during the last two weeks of the lockdown compared to its previous two weeks. Unmarried or divorced marital status, mental health history, poor perceived quality of physical health, impaired family functioning, anxiety and depression symptoms were independently associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation, whereas higher resilience, positive feelings with regard to the lockdown measures, relationship with friends, and faith in a Supreme Being were associated with lower suicidal ideation odds. According to the findings, suicidal ideation prevalence might be considered elevated and its increase during the lockdown period alarming. The risk and protective factors identified in the study offer valuable information for the development of preventive strategies against suicidal ideation, especially in times of crisis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113713,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113713,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113713,2021-03-01,,,
206,Impact of a shelter-in-place order during the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdoses,"Introduction Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, there have been concerns about the potential impact of the pandemic on persons with opioid use disorder. Shelter-in-place (SIP) orders, which aimed to reduce the spread and scope of the virus, likely also impacted this patient population. This study aims to assess the role of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdose before and after a SIP order. Methods A retrospective review of the incidence of opioid overdoses in an urban three-hospital system was conducted. Comparisons were made between the first 100 days of a city-wide SIP order during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 100 days during the COVID-19 pandemic preceding the SIP order (Pre-SIP). Differences in observed incidence and expected incidence during the SIP period were evaluated using a Fisher's Exact test. Results Total patient visits decreased 22% from 46,078 during the Pre-SIP period to 35,971 during the SIP period. A total of 1551 opioid overdoses were evaluated during the SIP period, compared to 1665 opioid overdoses during the Pre-SIP period, consistent with a 6.8% decline. A Fisher's Exact Test demonstrated a p < 0.0001, with a corresponding Odds Ratio of 1.20 with a 95% confidence interval (1.12;1.29). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated SIP order were associated with a statistically and clinically significant increase in the proportion of opioid overdoses in relation to the overall change in total ED visits.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.12.047,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.12.047,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.12.047,2021-03-01,,,

208,Reimagining patient-centered care in opioid treatment programs: Lessons from the Bronx during COVID-19,"Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) operate within a rigid set of clinical guidelines and regulations that specify the number of required OTP visits for supervised administration of methadone. To ensure physical distancing in light of COVID-19, the federal government loosened regulations to allow for additional flexibility. As OTP providers in the Bronx, NY, caring for more than 3600 patients in the epicenter of both the overdose and COVID-19 pandemics, we describe how our clinical practice changed with COVID-19. We halted toxicology testing, and to promote physical distancing and prevent interruptions in access to treatment for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), we drastically increased unsupervised take-home doses of MOUD. Within two weeks, we reduced the proportion of patients with 5–6 OTP visits per week from 47.2% to 9.4%. To guide treatment decision-making, we shifted focus from toxicology tests to other patient-centered measures, such as engagement in care and patient goals. In the initial three months, our patients experienced six nonfatal overdoses, no fatal overdoses, and 20 deaths attributable to COVID-19. This experience provides an opportunity to re-imagine care in OTPs going forward. We advocate that OTPs rely less on toxicology testing and more on the other patient-centered measures to guide decisions about distribution of take-home doses of MOUD. To minimize financial risk to OTPs and facilitate their transition to a more flexible model of care, we advocate for the reassessment of OTP reimbursement models.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108219,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108219,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108219,2021-03-01,,,

This study aims to understand the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and identify risk and protective factors during pregnancy. Methods Participants were 303 pregnant individuals from Ontario, Canada. Depression, anxiety and insomnia were measured using validated questionnaires. COVID-related experiences (i.e., financial difficulties, relationship conflict, social isolation) were assessed in relation to mental health. Social support and cognitive appraisal of the pandemic were examined as protective factors. Results 57% of the sample reported clinically elevated depression, >30% reported elevated worries, and 19% reported elevated insomnia. Depression (t = 25.14, p < .0001) and anxiety (t = 17.21, p < .0001) levels were higher than non-COVID pregnant samples. Social isolation, financial trouble, relationship difficulties and threat of COVID-19 were associated with mental health. Social support (rrange −.24 to −.38, p <.01) was associated with lower mental health problems and negative cognitive appraisal (rrange .20 to .33, p <.01) was linked to more mental health problems. Furthermore, social support and cognitive appraisal interacted (β = -.92, SE = .41, p < .05), such that higher social support acted as a protective factor, particularly for those who appraise the impact of COVID-19 to be more negative. Conclusions Findings underscore the need to address the high rates of mental health during pregnancy and outline potential targets (cognitive appraisal and social support) to protect pregnant people from experiencing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.027,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.027,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.027,2021-03-01,,,

218,"Quality of life in the COVID-19 outbreak: influence of psychological distress, government strategies, social distancing, and emotional recovery","Considering the severity of the effects of COVID-19 on psychological health and quality of life, the present study investigates the direct effects of government strategies and social distancing and the moderating effect of emotional recovery on psychological distress and quality of life using the tenets of the theory of attachment and learned helplessness. The snowball sampling technique was used to recruit respondents from Bangladesh who completed a self-administered questionnaire via Google Forms, which provided cross-sectional data. The results revealed that both social distancing and government strategies have significant negative influences on psychological distress. Besides, government strategies have a significant positive influence on social distancing. Although psychological distress has a significant negative influence on quality of life, emotional recovery shows no moderating effect on the relationship between psychological distress and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study provides insights for regulatory bodies and policymakers for developing effective policy interventions to ensure the well-being of people during this pandemic.

221,Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 inpatients who underwent psychiatric consultations,"Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are at risk of developing many neuropsychiatric disorders, due to the effects of the disease on the brain and the psychosocial pressures of having the disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19, who underwent psychiatric consultations. The medical records of 892 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and the 89 among them who requested psychiatric consultations were analyzed retrospectively. After the psychiatric consultations, patients were most frequently diagnosed with delirium (38.2 %), adjustment disorder (27.0 %), depressive disorder (19.1 %) and anxiety disorder (11.2 %). Patients with delirium had longer hospital stays (p < 0.001), were transferred more frequently to intensive care units (p < 0.001), and had higher mortality rates during their hospital stays (p < 0.001), than all other patients. The need for oxygen (p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) was also significantly higher in delirium patients, as well as in patients who received other psychiatric diagnoses.

223,With crisis comes opportunity: Unanticipated benefits resulting from pivots to take-home naloxone (THN) programs during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in stay-at-home orders, which presented a significant challenge to the design and operation of an essential harm-reduction strategy in the opioid epidemic: community-based, take-home naloxone (THN) programs. This commentary describes how four rural and/or Appalachian communities quickly pivoted their existing THN programs to respond to community need. These pivots, which reflect both the context of each community and the capacities of its service delivery and technology platforms, resulted in enhancements to THN training and distribution that have maintained or expanded the reach of their efforts. Additionally, all four community pivots are both highly sustainable and transferrable to other communities planning to or currently implementing THN training and distribution programs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108220,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108220,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108220,2021-03-01,,,

225,An Emotion Care Model using Multimodal Textual Analysis on COVID-19,"At the dawn of the year 2020, the world was hit by a significant pandemic COVID-19, that traumatized the entire planet. The infectious spread grew in leaps and bounds and forced the policymakers and governments to move towards lockdown. The lockdown further compelled people to stay under house arrest, which further resulted in an outbreak of emotions on social media platforms. Perceiving people's emotional state during these times becomes critically and strategically important for the government and the policymakers. In this regard, a novel emotion care scheme has been proposed in this paper to analyze multimodal textual data contained in real-time tweets related to COVID-19. Moreover, this paper studies 8-scale emotions (Anger, Anticipation, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, and Trust) over multiple categories such as nature, lockdown, health, education, market, and politics. This is the first of its kind linguistic analysis on multiple modes pertaining to the pandemic to the best of our understanding. Taking India as a case study, we inferred from this textual analysis that ‘joy’ has been lesser towards everything (~9-15%) but nature (~17%) due to the apparent fact of lessened pollution. The education system entailed more trust (~29%) due to teachers' fraternity's consistent efforts. The health sector witnessed sadness (~16%) and fear (~18%) as the dominant emotions among the masses as human lives were at stake. Additionally, the state-wise and emotion-wise depiction is also provided.

229,NO<inf>2</inf> levels as a contributing factor to COVID-19 deaths: The first empirical estimate of threshold values,"This study represents the first empirical estimation of threshold values between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and COVID-19-related deaths in France. The concentration of NO2 linked to COVID-19-related deaths in three major French cities were determined using Artificial Neural Networks experiments and a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of NO2 in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that NO2, as a precursor to secondary particulate matter formation, can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. Three different neural networks for the cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille were built in this work, followed by the application of an innovative tool of cutting the signal from the inputs to the selected target. The results show that the threshold levels of NO2 connected to COVID-19 range between 15.8 μg/m3 for Lyon, 21.8 μg/m3 for Marseille and 22.9 μg/m3 for Paris, which were significantly lower than the average annual concentration limit of 40 μg/m³ imposed by Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663,Scopus,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663,2021-03-01,,,
230,Prevalence and predictors of post-traumatic stress symptoms and depressive symptoms among Bangladeshi students during COVID-19 mandatory home confinement: A nationwide cross-sectional survey,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought not only the risk of infection but also unbearable mental health difficulties with the concern of educational loss among students. This study explored the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Bangladeshi students’ mental health and detected potential influencing factors related to post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and depressive symptoms. Convenience sampling was applied to collect data via online survey from 3997 college and university students between 29th May and 22nd July 2020. PHQ-9 and IES scales were used to assess depressive symptoms and PTSS, respectively. Of all participants, 52.87% had depressive symptoms and 40.91% had PTSS. Severe educational disruption was a risk factor for depressive symptoms (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.37–2.06) and PTSS (AOR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.51–2.29). COVID-19 like symptoms including fever, cough, breathing difficulty and fatigue showed a stronger association with higher IES and PHQ-9 scores than other symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, sore throat) (p ≤ 0.01). Fear of infection and death by COVID-19 were risk factors for PTSS and depressive symptoms (p ≤ 0.01). Recreational activity and regular physical exercise emerged as the most protective factors for depressive symptoms and PTSS.

233,Characterizing pediatric emergency department visits during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective We determine how pediatric emergency department (ED) visits changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of U.S. EDs. Methods Using retrospective data from January–June 2020, compared to a similar 2019 period, we calculated weekly 2020–2019 ratios of Non-COVID-19 ED visits for adults and children (age 18 years or less) by age range. Outcomes were pediatric ED visit rates before and after the onset of pandemic, by age, disposition, and diagnosis. Results We included data from 2,213,828 visits to 144 EDs and 4 urgent care centers in 18 U.S. states, including 7 EDs in children's hospitals. During the pandemic period, adult non-COVID-19 visits declined to 60% of 2019 volumes and then partially recovered but remained below 2019 levels through June 2020. Pediatric visits declined even more sharply, with peak declines through the week of April 15 of 74% for children age < 10 years and 67% for 14–17 year. Visits recovered by June to 72% for children age 14–17, but to only 50% of 2019 levels for children < age 10 years. Declines were seen across all ED types and locations, and across all diagnoses, with an especially sharp decline in non-COVID-19 communicable diseases. During the pandemic period, there was 22% decline in common serious pediatric conditions, including appendicitis. Conclusion Pediatric ED visits fell more sharply than adult ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and remained depressed through June 2020, especially for younger children. Declines were also seen for serious conditions, suggesting that parents may have avoided necessary care for their children.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.11.037,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.11.037,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.11.037,2021-03-01,,,
234,Prevalence and correlates of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic and the major role of stigmatization in low- and middle-income countries: A multinational cross-sectional study,"Objectives Currently, there is little data on the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to examine the pooled and separate prevalence and determinants of depression during the pandemic in samples from four LMICs. Methods Participants (N= 1267, 40.9% women) were recruited from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo. They completed an online cross-sectional survey on sociodemographics, exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression subscale, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2. Results The pooled prevalence for depression symptoms was 24.3% (95% CI: 22.08-26.79%), with significant differences across countries. Younger age, gender (women), and high levels of exposure and stigmatization related to COVIID-19, and resilience were associated with depression in the pooled data. There were significant variations at the country level. Stigmatization (but not exposure to COVID-19 and resilience) was a strong predictor among the four countries. Conclusions The prevalence of depression symptoms in the LMICs are similar to those reported in China and in most high-income countries during the pandemic. The findings emphasize the need for implementing non-fear-based education programs during epidemics to reduce stigmatization.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113714,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113714,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113714,2021-03-01,,,
235,Anxiety and Depression Associated with the Management of COVID-19 Among Healthcare workers in Cameroon,"Objectif La pandémie de la COVID-19 a eu un retentissement important dans le monde, à différents niveaux. La littérature consultée indique que les travailleurs de santé, en première ligne de la riposte, sont généralement ceux qui paient le plus lourd tribu. La présente étude évalue l’importance des symptomatologies anxieuse et dépressive chez ces acteurs de la riposte à la COVID-19, dans le contexte du Cameroun. Méthode La Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) a été mise à contribution pour évaluer les symptomatologies anxieuse et dépressive. La collecte des données a eu recours à la construction d’un web questionnaire sur la plateforme Google Forms. Le lien du questionnaire a été envoyé à des groupes professionnels dans les 10 Régions du pays, au préalable de leur consentement éclairé. Au total, 331 professionnels de santé ont été interrogés sur la période du 05 au 19 avril 2020. Résultats Les résultats montrent un taux important d’anxiété (41,8 %) et de dépression (42,8 %). On observe une plus forte susceptibilité à la dépression chez les sujets jeunes (30-39 ans). La peur de la contamination et la peur de la mort sont des facteurs modulateurs de la dépression et de l’anxiété. La comorbidité anxiété-dépression dans l’échantillon est de 14,73 %. Les taux de prévalence du trouble dépressif majeur et du trouble de l’adaptation dans l’échantillon sont respectivement de 8,2 % et 3,3 %. Les données présentées confirment les tendances enregistrées dans la littérature, concernant l’impact des épidémies mortelles sur la santé mentale des travailleurs de santé. Discussion Les résultats indiquent, comme c’est le cas dans la plupart des travaux consultés dans la littérature, que la pandémie de la Covid 19 affecte de manière importante la santé mentale des travailleurs de santé. Ceci souligne l’urgence de mettre en place un dispositif d’aide et/ou d’accompagnement spécialisé, dans le contexte de l’actuelle pandémie, comme celui des crises sanitaires de même nature. Un tel dispositif n’existe pas au Cameroun, où la réponse de santé mentale reste faible. Conclusion Ces résultats suggèrent que les personnels de santé engagés dans la riposte contre la COVID-19 au Cameroun sont affectés de manière significative dans leur santé mentale. Ce qui souligne la nécessité d’une aide psychologique spécialisée pour le personnel soignant. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. Method The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. Result The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. Discussion The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and/or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. Conclusion These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health.

239,Parenting activities and the transition to home-based education during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study reports on parent-child dynamics during initial COVID-19 related school closures, based on cross-sectional analyses of a survey that utilized a convenience sampling approach. Data were collected in April 2020, approximately five weeks after the World Health Organization declared that the Coronavirus was a pandemic. Participants (N = 405) were adults recruited throughout the U.S. This study examines data from parents (69% mothers and 31% fathers) with at least one child 0–12 years of age. The majority were White (71%) and 41% had at least a bachelor’s degree. The majority of parents (78%) were educating their child at home due to COVID-19. Most (77.1%) reported use of online tools for at-home education, including educational apps, social media, and school-provided electronic resources. More than one-third (34.7%) of parents said their child’s behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B = −0.16, 95% CI = [−0.29, −0.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B = −0.37, 95% CI = [−0.47, −0.27], p < .001) were negatively associated with parents’ perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = 0.17, 95% CI = [0.06, 0.28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = 0.40, 95% CI = [0.32, 0.48], p < .001). Content analyses of open-ended questions indicated that school closures were a significant disruption, followed by lack of physical activity, and social isolation.

242,Low uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviours and high socioeconomic impact of lockdown measures in South Asia: Evidence from a large-scale multi-country surveillance programme,"Background South Asia has become a major epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding South Asians’ awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region. Methods We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries. Data were collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative. Results Participants were 61% female, mean age 45.1 years. Almost half had one or more chronic disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Knowledge of the primary COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%). Key preventive measures were not widely adopted. Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to long-term medications; 40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression. The prevalence of unemployment rose from 9.3% to 39.4% (P < 0.001), and household income fell by 52% (P < 0.001) during the lockdown. Younger people and those from less affluent socio-economic groups were most severely impacted. Sedentary time increased by 32% and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake increased by 10% (P < 0.001 for both), while tobacco and alcohol consumption dropped by 41% and 80%, respectively (P < 0.001), during the lockdown. Conclusions Our results identified important knowledge, access and uptake barriers to the prevention of COVID-19 in South Asia, and demonstrated major adverse impacts of the pandemic on chronic disease treatment, mental health, health-related behaviours, employment and household finances. We found important sociodemographic differences for impact, suggesting a widening of existing inequalities. Our findings underscore the need for immediate large-scale action to close gaps in knowledge and access to essential resources for prevention, along with measures to safeguard economic production and mitigate socio-economic impacts on the young and the poor.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100751,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100751,Scopus,10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100751,2021-03-01,,,
243,Do psychological strengths protect college students confined by COVID-19 to emotional distress? The role of gender,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a stressful situation for the university population due to the important changes in the development of their studies and in their living conditions. However, the impact of factors related to the family unit (living with COVID-19 positive patients and living with Essential Services Workers-ESW) and other protective psychosocial factors that could produce resilient or psychopathological results (anxiety and depression) in this population has not been sufficiently assessed, differentiating them by gender. The results obtained show that both variables related to the family unit and psychosocial protective variables explain 28.6% of the variance in general distress in the total sample (R2 = 0.286; F(3,250) =34,717; p < .001). However, models of regression of distress and anxiety levels differ between men and women, but not in terms of mood alteration. Women facing circumstances reminiscent of mandatory pandemic containment have moderately higher levels of resilience than men (tCDRISC(125) = 2.218; p < .05; tGSE(125) = 2.415; p < .05; tCDRISC(125) = 0.146; p = .884; tGSE(125) = 0.315; p = .756).

244,Immediate psychological responses during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi medical students,"Background The most recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has been creating multidimensional damages, including a detrimental impact on the mental health status of individuals. Medical students, a vulnerable cross-section of the population, may have perceived a myriad of psychological stressors during this crisis in the background of their prevailing stressful academic pressure and preexisting higher psychological and mental health issue. Objective To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to elucidate the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Bangladeshi medical students. Method A cross-sectional study design was utilized to conduct this survey. The online survey including demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; higher scores on the subscales indicate higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms), was completed by 425 Bangladeshi medical students. Collected data were statistically analyzed by using SPSS (version 25.0) software. Result The HADS anxiety subscale revealed that 65.9% of the medical students had different levels of anxiety, ranging from mild (27.3%), moderate (26.8%), and severe (11.8%). As per HADS depression subscale, 49.9% of the medical students had varying degrees of depressive symptoms, with 3.3% of the participants had suffered from severe depressive symptoms. Female students had a relatively more anxiety and depressive symptoms when compared with males. The students, who were severely tensed of getting infected by the virus, were at higher risk of suffering from anxiety (3.5-fold) and depressive (2.7-fold) symptoms, when compared with no/minimally stressed students. Besides, fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to hospital or home, not to be able to give maximum concentration on study after COVID-19 pandemic, students’ present emotional status (agitation), had statistically significant higher risk of anxiety. Conclusion A substantial proportion of Bangladeshi medical students are experiencing pandemic-related adverse psychological impact. Poor mental health conditions of these vulnerable medical students pose important threat to their potential contribution in future health care. Thus, medical colleges and health authorities should focus on addressing their psychological needs and formulate effective strategies to ameliorate medical students’ mental health status, particularly during any infectious disease outbreak.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105912,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105912,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105912,2021-03-01,,,
245,The role of online social comparison as a protective factor for psychological wellbeing: A longitudinal study during the COVID-19 quarantine,"During the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the experience of quarantine has been an undesirable condition for people and it can have a negative impact on mental health and psychological wellbeing. Social isolation has led to an increase in time spent on social network sites, with people interacting more frequently with each other, and comparing online the way in which they are experiencing the same state of home confinement. Our study aimed to investigate the role of online social comparison on individuals' psychological distress and life satisfaction during the COVID-19-related quarantine. Specifically, a cross-lagged panel study at three-waves was conducted in Italy in order to examine the change in psychosocial distress levels (e.g. depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, low life-satisfaction) from before the quarantine for a period of one month, as well as the predictive role of online social comparison to ameliorate individual distress. An online survey was distributed through a social media platform three times after the initial lockdown and at the epidemic's peak two and five weeks later. A total of 113 participants participated in an online survey between the 7th of March and 14th of April 2020. The results showed an increase in the levels of loneliness, depression, stress, anxiety and a decrease in the level of life satisfaction in the pre/post quarantine comparison. Our cross-lagged results also showed that online social comparison at T1 and T2 predicted the individual's improvement in levels of anxiety, stress, loneliness and life satisfaction over time. Overall, the results of the current study underline the positive effects of online social comparison on the reduction of psychological distress during the COVID-19 quarantine.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110486,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110486,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2020.110486,2021-03-01,,,

247,Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with allergic diseases,"Background On March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic disease. Interactions between allergy-related inflammatory and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been documented. Therefore, those who have pre-existing allergic conditions may have an increased psychiatric reaction to the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective Identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 in patients with allergic diseases and determine if these individuals have a greater risk of presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods It is a cross-sectional, survey-based study designed to assess the degree of symptoms of depression and the risk of PTSD using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), respectively, in allergic patients. Results A total of 4106 surveys were evaluated; 1656 (40.3%) were patients with allergic disease, and 2450 (59.7%) were non-allergic (control) individuals. Of those with allergies, 76.6% had respiratory allergic disease including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Individuals with allergic disease reported higher scores regarding symptoms of PTSD on the IES-R scale (p = 0.052, OR 1.24 CI 0.99–1.55) as well as a higher depression risk score in the PHQ-9 questionnaire (mean 6.82 vs. 5.28) p = 0.000 z = −8.76. The allergy group presented a higher score in the IES-R questionnaire (mean 25.42 vs. 20.59), being more susceptible to presenting PTSD (p = 0.000, z = −7.774). The individuals with allergic conditions were further divided into subgroups of those with respiratory allergies such as allergic rhinitis and asthma vs those with non-respiratory allergies such as drug and food allergy, urticaria and atopic dermatitis. This subgroup analysis compares respiratory versus non-respiratory allergic patients, with similar results on the IES-R (mean 25.87 vs 23.9) p = 0.0124, z = −1.539. There was no significant difference on intrusion (p = 0.061, z = −1.873) and avoidance (p = 0.767, z = −0.297), but in the hyperarousal subscale, patients with respiratory allergy had higher scores (mean 1.15 vs. 0.99) p = 0.013 z = −2.486. Conclusions Psychological consequences such as depression and reported PTSD are present during the COVID-19 pandemic causing an impact particularly in individuals with allergic diseases. If we acknowledge the impact and how it is affecting our patients, we are able to implement interventions, follow up, and contribute to their overall well-being.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2021.100510,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2021.100510,Scopus,10.1016/j.waojou.2021.100510,2021-03-01,,,

250,Mental well-being and association of the four factors coping structure model: A perspective of people living in lockdown during COVID-19,"Background The physical and mental health risks of COVID-19 become higher as people are asked to stay home for an indefinite period. The objective was to investigate the link between the four-factor structure model of coping and mental health among those living in lockdown. Methods The sample was comprised of 100 participants. The data was collected through purposive sampling. Mental health was measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and coping strategies from the Brief Cope Inventory. A personal information questionnaire was also used to gather information about the characteristics of participants, such as age, gender and education, in addition to questions related to other stressors. Linear regression was used to assess the association between variables. A P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Overall, the results showed high levels of stress, anxiety and depression among participants. These findings revealed a significant association between active avoidance and religious/denial coping strategies and mental health problems. However, problem-focused and positive coping strategies were found to be insignificant for all three mental health problems. Other social and personal factors, such as being away from family (90%), having problems sleeping (86%), worrying about the future (85%), experiencing anger (83%), lacking emotional support (79%) and having fear of receiving bad news (72%), were reported often by participants. Conclusion Participants showed concern for COVID-19 that was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These findings have important implications for public health emergency preparedness planning. Moreover, psychological preparedness in the community is essential.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100605,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100605,Scopus,10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100605,2021-03-01,,,
251,The prevalence and risk factors of depression in prenatal and postnatal women in China with the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019,"Background The prevalence of depression increase with the outbreaks of epidemic disease. The prevalence of depression during the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in prenatal and postnatal women was examined in China. Methods 2201 prenatal and postnatal women in mainland China were recruited in this cross-sectional study from February 28th to April 26th, 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression in prenatal and postnatal women. Results The prevalence rate of depression was 35.4%. The risk factors for depression included drinking (p = 0.04; adjusted OR = 2.81, 95%CI: 1.26~6.24), nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 3.54, 95%CI: 1.10~11.44), pregnancy's influence on mobility (p = 0.02; adjusted OR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.11~1.83), anxiety (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.57~1.75), insomnia (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.14~1.21) and daily attention to fetal movement (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.31~0.56). Limitations This study used a cross-sectional design, and cannot compare changes in the incidence of depression before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions During the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence rate of depression among Chinese prenatal and postnatal women was 35.4%. Moreover, anxiety, insomnia, drinking, nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, as well as the impaired movement and less daily monitoring of fetal movement were risk factors for depression.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.019,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.019,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.019,2021-03-01,,,
252,No impact of confinement during COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression in Parkinsonian patients,"Background Governments around the world have imposed varied containment measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19 infection. The psychological impact could be highly negative in patients with neurologic condition like Parkinson's Disease (PD). Methods We prospectively evaluated symptoms of depression and anxiety in 50 (26 females; mean age at 60.4) non demented Moroccan PD patients, using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), at the beginning and after 6 weeks of a full confinement. Results At the first evaluation, 28% of patients had depression while 32% had anxiety. After 6 weeks of confinement, some patients got worse and others got better scores but no significant statistical difference for both troubles was seen. Conclusion Our results show that there is no significant impact of 6 weeks of confinement on overall anxiety and depression scores.

257,Ancillary services in Great Britain during the COVID-19 lockdown: A glimpse of the carbon-free future,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to partial or total lockdowns in several countries during the first half of 2020, which in turn caused a depressed electricity demand. In Great Britain (GB), this low demand combined with large renewable output at times, created conditions that were not expected until renewable capacity increases to meet emissions targets in coming years. The GB system experienced periods of very high instantaneous penetration of non-synchronous renewables, compromising system stability due to the lack of inertia in the grid. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the consequences of the lockdown on the GB electricity system is provided, focusing on the ancillary services procured to guarantee stability. Ancillary-services costs increased by £200m in the months of May to July 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 (a threefold increase), highlighting the importance of ancillary services in low-carbon systems. Furthermore, a frequency-secured scheduling model is used in the present paper to showcase the future trends that GB is expected to experience, as penetration of renewables increases on the road to net-zero emissions by 2050. Several sensitivities are considered, demonstrating that the share of total operating costs represented by ancillary services could reach 35%.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116500,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116500,Scopus,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116500,2021-03-01,,,
258,Sooner than you think: A very early affective reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine in Argentina,"The unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic pose serious challenges to mood stability and emotional regulation at all ages. Although many people tend to react resiliently to stress, others appear to display emotional anxiety and depression-related symptoms. In this study, we carried out a survey (N = 10,053) during the first week of the general lockdown (quarantine) in Argentina to measure early affective reactions in Argentine adults. Respondents showed substantial anxious and depressive symptoms, with 33% and 23% of participants reporting possible depressive and anxious syndromes, respectively, with the youngest group (18 to 25 y.o.) showing the highest prevalence of symptoms. Even if prior mental health problems predisposed or aggravated the reaction, participants without prior complaints showed signs of psychological impact. Using linear regression, the most important independent variables related to depressive symptoms were the feeling of loneliness followed by daily stress. In the case of anxious states, the strongest variables were negative repetitive thinking and feeling of loneliness. Other psychological, economic, and social factors are discussed. This study is in line with previous literature that highlight the importance of the psychological impact of pandemics, but additionally demonstrates that these reactions are present at a large scale immediately after the start of quarantine with very low infectious rates as an early anticipatory adaptive reaction leading to potential negative outcomes from adjustment disorders to major disorders. In addition, the present results provide potentially relevant information about sudden environmental impacts on affective states and specific pathways for anxiety and depression to be expressed.

Many of these patients admitted to making home brews of alcohol while others simply use industrial toxic alcohols. The diagnosis of these poisonings is challenging as direct assays are not available in our setting. Case report We present a case of presumed ethylene glycol poisoning that presented with persistent seizures and a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). Discussion A high index of suspicion for toxic alcohol poisoning should be maintained in patients presenting with an altered mental status, seizures and a HAGMA.

261,Macroeconomic policies and the pandemic-driven recession,"We build a three-country DSGE model to address the economic fallout from the COVID-19 shock. First, three different scenarios –optimistic, baseline and pessimistic– are drawn where economic authorities are assumed to not react to the disturbance. We find that the pandemic brings about a prolonged economic depression in the latter scenario –the most realistic one–, as GDP and hours worked fall by 20% (from trend) and they never recover their pre-crisis levels over the span of time studied. We then move on to analyze the effectiveness of conventional fiscal and monetary policy tools in curbing the recessionary consequences of the pandemic. The most powerful instruments are government purchases and expansionary monetary policy, although these two measures come with some trade-offs. In addition, we explore how a binding zero lower bound (ZLB) that renders conventional monetary policy ineffective can affect our findings. We show that the lower constraint deepens the recession caused by the pandemic, primarily because the central bank cannot lower the policy rate further, and because fiscal policy tightens in order to ensure government debt sustainability. Naturally, we next ask ourselves what would happen in this context did the monetary authority rely on unconventional monetary policy to try to dampen the recessionary consequences of the pandemic. Our results reveal that quantitative easing (QE) prevents private consumption, inflation, and to a much lesser extent, output from falling as much due to the shock.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.iref.2020.12.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.iref.2020.12.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.iref.2020.12.010,2021-03-01,,,

268,Antidepressant drugs as emerging contaminants: Occurrence in urban and non-urban waters and analytical methods for their detection,"Antidepressants are drugs with a direct action on the brain's biochemistry through their interaction with the neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The increasing worldwide contamination from these drugs may be witnessed through their increasing presence in the urban water cycle. Furthermore, their occurrence has been detected in non-urban water, such as rivers and oceans. Some endemic aquatic animals, such as certain fish and mollusks, have bioaccumulated different antidepressant drugs in their tissues. This problem will increase in the years to come because the present COVID-19 pandemic has increased the general worldwide occurrence of depression and anxiety, triggering the consumption of antidepressants and, consequently, their presence in the environment. This work provides information on the occurrence of the most administrated antidepressants in urban waters, wastewater treatment plants, rivers, and oceans. Furthermore, it provides an overview of the analytical approaches currently used to detect each antidepressant presented. Finally, the ecotoxicological effect of antidepressants on several in vivo models are listed. Considering the information provided in this review, there is an urgent need to test the presence of antidepressant members of the MAOI and TCA groups.

Cognitive biases have been related to depression degree in previous studies. Here, we used behavioral and brain imaging analysis, to determine if and how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the relationship between current cognitive biases and future depression degree and the underlying neural basis in a nonclinical depressed population. An out-expectation result showed that a more negative memory bias was associated with a greater decrease in future depressive indices in nonclinical depressed participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might be due to decreased social stress.

Results The results indicate that insecurity predicted students’ stress positively and that students with high-level perceived insecurity are more likely to perceive stress. Moreover, hope and self-efficacy mediated the relationship between insecurity and stress, indicating that hope and self-efficacy could buffer the negative effects of insecurity on stress. Limitations This study examines the mediating model between insecurity and stress among Chinese university students. The generalizability of the findings in other regions remains to be explored. Additionally, the roles of other positive self-beliefs including optimism and resilience in relieving stress can be further explored in future research. Conclusions This research provides direct evidence of insecurity effects on stress among university students, enriching relevant theories in the field of stress. Moreover, this research suggests that enhancing positive self-beliefs such as hope, and self-efficacy helps to relieve students’ stress during COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.047,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.047,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.047,2021-02-15,,,
276,Sleep Conditions Associate with Anxiety and Depression Symptoms among Pregnant Women during the Epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen,"Background Pregnant women often encounter psychiatric symptoms and declined sleep quality as pregnancy proceeds. The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. Methods An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. Results In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality. Limitations Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women. Conclusions Our research revealed a notable proportion of the pregnant women who exhibited mild anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. Targeted interventions in improving sleep conditions might help alleviate gestational anxious and depressive symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.114,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.114,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.114,2021-02-15,,,
277,Prevalence of psychological disorders in the COVID-19 epidemic in China: A real world cross-sectional study,"Objective This study aimed to explore the prevalence of psychological disorders and associated factors at different stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods The mental health status of respondents was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. Results 5657 individuals participated in this study. History of chronic disease was a common risk factor for severe present depression (OR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82–2.66, p < 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.41, 95% CI, 1.97–2.95, p < 0.001), and insomnia (OR 2.33, 95% CI, 1.83–2.95, p < 0.001) in the survey population. Female respondents had a higher risk of depression (OR 1.61, 95% CI, 1.39–1.87, p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.15–1.57, p < 0.001) than males. Among the medical workers, confirmed or suspected positive COVID-19 infection as associated with higher scores for depression (confirmed, OR 1.87; suspected, OR 4.13), anxiety (confirmed, OR 3.05; suspected, OR 3.07), and insomnia (confirmed, OR 3.46; suspected, OR 4.71). Limitation The cross-sectional design of present study presents inference about causality. The present psychological assessment was based on an online survey and on self-report tools, albeit using established instruments. We cannot estimate the participation rate, since we cannot know how many potential subjects received and opened the link for the survey. Conclusions Females, non-medical workers and those with a history of chronic diseases have had higher risks for depression, insomnia, and anxiety.

280,Prevalence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background The global COVID-19 pandemic has generated major mental and psychological health problems worldwide. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We searched online biomedical databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, CNKI, and Wanfang Data) and preprint databases (SSRN, bioRxiv, and MedRxiv) for observational studies from January 1, 2020 to March 16, 2020 investigating the prevalence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results We retrieved 821 citations from the biomedical databases and 53 citations from the preprint databases: 66 studies with 221,970 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia was 31.4%, 31.9%, 41.1% and 37.9%, respectively. Noninfectious chronic disease patients, quarantined persons, and COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of depression (Q=26.73, p<0.01) and anxiety (Q=21.86, p<0.01) than other populations. The general population and non-medical staff had a lower risk of distress than other populations (Q=461.21, p< 0.01). Physicians, nurses, and non-medical staff showed a higher prevalence of insomnia (Q=196.64, p<0.01) than other populations. Limitations All included studies were from the early phase of the global pandemic. Additional meta-analyses are needed to obtain more data in all phases of the pandemic. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic increases the mental health problems of the global population, particularly health care workers, noninfectious chronic disease patients, COVID-19 patients, and quarantined persons.

282,"Coping strategies, cyberbullying behaviors, and depression among Chinese netizens during the COVID-19 pandemic: a web-based nationwide survey","Background: As a major life stressor now, the COVID-19 pandemic could substantially increase risks of cyberbullying and depression for global people, especially in the context of increased digital interconnectedness and strict social distancing. Though people are adopting different coping strategies, still little is known about their cyberbullying and depression and how the two associated with coping strategies. Methods: A web-based nationwide questionnaire survey was conducted among 5,608 netizens during the peak time of COVID-19 in China. The study collected cross-sectional data on participants’ coping strategies, general cyberbullying behaviors, cyberbullying behaviors specifically to residents of Hubei Province where first COVID-19 case was reported, and depression. Results: A two-factor structure applied to participants’ coping strategies, namely problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping, and the former was more adopted. There existed gender, age, education, and income differences in the coping strategies. Problem-focused coping was associated with less cyberbullying behaviors while had no correlation with depression; emotion-focused coping was found positively correlated with cyberbullying and depression. The association between emotion-focused coping and depression was mediated by cyberbullying. Limitations: The study used cross-sectional design, and its findings should be cautioned to be generalized to other countries, due to the differences in culture, stage of crisis, and government policies on COVID-19. Conclusions: Problem-focused coping was associated with less cyberbullying, and emotion-focused coping predicted cyberbullying and depression. Cyberbullying mediated the correlation between emotion-focused coping and depression. These findings provide new perspectives for interventions on people's coping strategies towards COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.023,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.023,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.023,2021-02-15,,,
283,"The impact of social distancing during COVID-19: A conditional process model of negative emotions, alienation, affective disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder","Background The social distancing during COVID-19 is likely to cause a feeling of alienation, which may pose a threat to the public's mental health. Our research aims to examine the relationship between negative emotions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), considering the mediation effect of alienation and how it is moderated by anxiety and depression. Methods For this, the current study conducted a cross-sectional survey on 7145 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19, via online questionnaires comprised of a self-designed Negative emotions questionnaire, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90), PTSD Checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), and Adolescent Students Alienation Scale (ASAS). Results A total of 6666 pieces of data from the general population were included in the statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics showed a relatively mild level of mental disorders. Besides, results of Conditional Process Model analysis supported our hypotheses that negative emotions and alienation were both predictors for PTSD symptoms, and their direct and indirect effects were all moderated by the level of anxiety. Limitations This study was limited by the generality and causality of the conclusion. The moderating effect of depression was left for further study due to the collinearity problem of variables. Conclusions Social distancing may have an impact on individuals’ mental health by the feeling of alienation, which was moderated by affective disorders. Clinical psychologists should identify individuals’ particular cognition and mental disorders to provide a more accurate and adequate intervention for them.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.004,2021-02-15,,,
284,Mental Health Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China: A 2-Wave Longitudinal Survey,"Background Growing evidence supports a clear association between COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. However, little is known about the longitudinal course of psychopathology in young adults at different stages of the pandemic. Methods This large-scale, longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted among college students in China. The rates of three mental health problems (acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and their change patterns at two phases of the pandemic (early vs under-control) were measured. Predictors of changes in mental health symptoms were examined utilizing multivariate regression. Results Among the 164,101 college students who participated in the first wave survey (T1=during onset of outbreak), 68,685 (41.9%) completed a follow-up survey (T2=during remission). In the follow-up survey, the prevalence of probable acute stress (T1: 34.6%; T2: 16.4%) decreased, while the rates of depressive (T1: 21.6%; T2: 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (T1: 11.4%; T2: 14.7%) increased. Senior students, with suspected or conformed cases in their community and COVID-19 related worries (all AORs > 1.20, ps < 0.001) were found to have a higher risk of developing mental health problems in at least one wave. Less physical exercise, low perceived social support, and a dysfunctional family were found to negatively impact psychological symptoms. Conclusions Acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have been prevalent among college students during the COVID-19 epidemic, and showed a significant increase after the initial stage of the outbreak. Some college students, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibited persistent or delayed symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.109,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.109,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.109,2021-02-15,,,

Preliminary results from the BRIS-MHC STUDY.,"Background : The aim of this study was to evaluate potential differences about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown between community controls (CC) and patients with a mental illness (MI) in a Spanish population during the state of emergency. Methods : Individuals with a psychiatric condition and the general population were invited to complete an anonymous online survey. Bivariate analyses were used to compare them in a broad range of measures: sociodemographic, clinical variables, behavioral changes related to the lockdown and coping strategies to face it. Two groups of different psychiatric disorders were compared: depression or anxiety disorders (D+A) versus bipolar disorder and schizophrenia related disorders (BD+SCZ). Results : 413 CC and 206 MI were included in the study. CC reported to use more adaptive coping strategies as following a routine, talking to friends/relatives, practicing physical exercise and maintaining a balanced diet. MI reported significantly more anxiety and depression symptoms during the lockdown when compared to CC. Gaining weight, sleep changes, and tobacco consumption were more prevalent in the MI group. The D+A group showed significantly more psychological distress and negative expectations about the future, suffered more sleep disturbances when compared to BD+SCZ, whilst reported to practice more exercise. Limitations : psychiatric disorders were self-reported. Conclusions : Imposed restrictions and uncertainty during confinement had a higher psychological impact in individuals with a psychiatric illness, with less healthy behavior strategies to face the situation.

339,"Penetrating trauma during a global pandemic: Changing patterns in interpersonal violence, self-harm and domestic violence in the Covid-19 outbreak","Introduction The restrictions imposed on social activity in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound impact globally. In the UK, the NHS was placed on a war-footing, with elective surgery, face-to-face outpatient clinics, and community care facilities all scaled back as a temporary measure to redistribute scarce resources. There has been concern during this period over increasing levels of violence in the domestic setting, as well as self-harm. Methods Data was collected on all patients presenting with traumatic penetrating injuries during the ‘lockdown’ period of 23rd March to 29th April 2020. Demographics and injury details were compared with the same period in the two preceding years. Results Overall trauma fell by 35% compared with the previous year. Over one in four penetrating injuries seen were a result of self-harm, which was significantly higher than in previous years (11% in 2019, 2% in 2018). There were two cases of injuries due to domestic violence, while a total of 4 cases of injury arose in separate violent domestic incidents. Self-harm commonly involved penetrating injury to the neck. Discussion Our centre has seen an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries as a result of both self-harm and violence in the domestic setting. The number of penetrating neck injury cases, which can represent suicidal intent or a major presentation of psychiatric illness, is of particular concern. We must further investigate the effect of social restrictions on violent injury, and how home confinement may influence a changing demographic picture of victims.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004,2021-02-01,,,
340,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care-recorded mental illness and self-harm episodes in the UK: a population-based cohort study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected population mental health. We aimed to assess temporal trends in primary care-recorded common mental illness, episodes of self-harm, psychotropic medication prescribing, and general practitioner (GP) referrals to mental health services during the COVID-19 emergency in the UK. Methods We did a population-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from general practices registered on the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We included patient records from Jan 1, 2010, to Sept 10, 2020, to establish long-term trends and patterns of seasonality, but focused primarily on the period January, 2019–September, 2020. We extracted data on clinical codes entered into patient records to estimate the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders, self-harm, prescriptions for antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and GP referrals to mental health services, and assessed event rates of all psychotropic prescriptions and self-harm. We used mean-dispersion negative binomial regression models to predict expected monthly incidence and overall event rates, which were then compared with observed rates to assess the percentage reduction in incidence and event rates after March, 2020. We also stratified analyses by sex, age group, and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. Findings We identified 14 210 507 patients from 1697 UK general practices registered in the CPRD databases. In April, 2020, compared with expected rates, the incidence of primary care-recorded depression had reduced by 43·0% (95% CI 38·3–47·4), anxiety disorders by 47·8% (44·3–51·2), and first antidepressant prescribing by 36·4% (33·9–38·8) in English general practices. Reductions in first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders were largest for adults of working age (18–44 and 45–64 years) and for patients registered at practices in more deprived areas. The incidence of self-harm was 37·6% (34·8–40·3%) lower than expected in April, 2020, and the reduction was greatest for women and individuals aged younger than 45 years. By September, 2020, rates of incident depression, anxiety disorder, and self-harm were similar to expected levels. In Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, rates of incident depression and anxiety disorder remained around a third lower than expected to September, 2020. In April, 2020, the rate of referral to mental health services was less than a quarter of the expected rate for the time of year (75·3% reduction [74·0–76·4]). Interpretation Consequences of the considerable reductions in primary care-recorded mental illness and self-harm could include more patients subsequently presenting with greater severity of mental illness and increasing incidence of non-fatal self-harm and suicide. Addressing the effects of future lockdowns and longer-term impacts of economic instability on mental health should be prioritised.

342,Suicidal and self-harm ideation among Chinese hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence and correlates,"The COVID-19 pandemic put global medical systems under massive pressure for its uncertainty, severity, and persistence. For detecting the prevalence of suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI) and its related risk factors among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional study collected the sociodemographic data, epidemic-related information, the psychological status and need, and perceived stress and support from 11507 staff in 46 hospitals by an online survey from February 14 to March 2, 2020. The prevalence of SSI was 6.47%. Hospital staff with SSI had high family members or relatives infected number and the self-rated probability of infection. Additionally, they had more perceived stress, psychological need, and psychological impact. On the contrary, hospital staff without SSI reported high self-rated health, willingness to work in a COVID-19 ward, confidence in defeating COVID-19, and perceived support. Furthermore, they reported better marital or family relationship, longer sleep hours, and shorter work hours. The infection of family members or relatives, poor marital status, poor self-rated health, the current need for psychological intervention, perceived high stress, perceived low support, depression, and anxiety were independent factors to SSI. A systematic psychological intervention strategy during a public health crisis was needed for the hospital staff's mental well-being.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113654,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113654,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113654,2021-02-01,,,

348,Preliminary investigation of the association between COVID-19 and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the U.S.,"Evidence suggests that the negative consequences of COVID-19 may extend far beyond its considerable death toll, having a significant impact on psychological well-being. Despite work highlighting the link between previous epidemics and elevated suicide rates, there is limited research on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Utilizing an online survey, the current study aimed to better understand the presence, and extent, of the association between COVID-19-related experiences and past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adults in the United States recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 907). Results support an association between several COVID-19-related experiences (i.e., general distress, fear of physical harm, effects of social distancing policies) and past-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Further, a significant proportion of those with recent suicidal ideation explicitly link their suicidal thoughts to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses highlight a potential additional link between COVID-19 and suicidal behavior, suggesting that a portion of individuals may be intentionally exposing themselves to the virus with intent to kill themselves. These findings underscore the need for suicide risk screening and access to mental health services during the current pandemic. Particular attention should be paid to employing public health campaigns to disseminate information on such services to reduce the enormity of distress and emotional impairment associated with COVID-19 in the United States.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.037,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.037,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.037,2021-02-01,,,

352,Suicidal behaviors and suicide risk among Bangladeshi people during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online cross-sectional survey,"Background Suicide, a major public health concern, is a leading cause of injury and death worldwide. The present study aims to assess suicidal behaviors and suicide risk among Bangladeshi people during COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from July 10 to July 20, 2020, involving 1,415 Bangladeshi residents ages 18 years or older. Data was collected via an anonymous online questionnaire. The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised was used to assess suicide risk. The depression and anxiety subscales of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analyses and Pearson's correlation were performed to examine the association of variables. Results The prevalence of suicide ideation and planning among Bangladeshi people during the COVID-19 pandemic was 19.0% and 18.5%, respectively. Having suicidal risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by 33.5% participants. Suicide risk was associated higher with females, divorced or widowed marital statuses and low educational attainment (i.e., secondary or below and higher secondary/diploma). Additionally, living in high COVID-19 prevalent areas, having economic loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, relatives or acquaintances die from COVID-19, direct contact with COVID-19 patient(s), and fear of COVID-19 infection were associated with suicide risk. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic imposes significant psychological consequences on people, thus, concerned authorities should pay attention to people's mental health and focus on suicide prevention and awareness during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e05937,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e05937,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e05937,2021-02-01,,,

366,Suicide during COVID-19 and other major international respiratory outbreaks: A systematic review,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recently declared a pandemic by the WHO. This outbreak threatens not only physical health but also has significant repercussions on mental health. In recent world history, major infectious outbreaks were associated with severe mental health sequelae, including suicide. In this study, we systematically review the literature on suicidal outcomes during major international respiratory outbreaks, including COVID-19. We reviewed descriptive and analytic articles addressing suicide during major international respiratory outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases and then utilized an independent method for study selection by a pair of reviewers. Two reviewers completed data abstraction and conducted a narrative summary of the findings. Our search generated 2,153 articles. Nine studies (three descriptive, five analytical, and one with mixed methodology) were eligible. The included studies were heterogeneous, divergent in methods, and with a low degree of evidence. Deducing an association between pandemics, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes remains thus poorly supported. Future research with better methodological characteristics, the use of longitudinal studies, and a focus on suicide as the primary outcome would allow for an in-depth understanding and formulation of the scope of this problem.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102509,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102509,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102509,2021-02-01,,,

368,Correlates of psychological distress in epileptic patients during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Introduction Following the severe consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, on March 9th, 2020 the Italian Government implemented extraordinary measures to limit viral transmission, including restrictive quarantine measures. Psychological distress represents the seizure-precipitating factor most often reported by patients with epilepsy. To date, no studies have analyzed the role played by the different dimensions of psychological distress quarantine-induced in patients with epilepsy. Materials and Methods We included a total of 40 patients, 18 suffered from generalized, and 22 from focal epilepsy. The patients previously seen in the outpatient clinic during the pre-lockdown period between January and February 2020 were reevaluated after the lockdown period. Psychological distress was evaluated by using the three subscales of Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Finally, we employed logistic regression analyses to explore the demographic and clinical features associated to high scores on IES-R. Results Patients with higher scores on IES-R Intrusion and IES-R Avoidance subscales demonstrated an increased number of epileptic attacks compared to prelockdown period. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that a specific subgroup of patients (i.e., older, female with more anxious symptoms) are at higher risk of increased seizure frequency. Conclusions Our study confirmed that the frequency of epileptic seizures increased during lockdown when compared to pre-lockdown period. The early identification of patients more vulnerable to worsening is crucial to limit the risk of requiring hospital or clinical treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107632,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107632,Scopus,10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107632,2021-02-01,,,

370,An Online Questionnaire Survey on the Sexual Life and Sexual Function of Chinese Adult Men During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic,"Introduction There has been no report regarding the impact on male sexual life or sexual function by changes in lifestyle during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Aim To investigate the changes in sexual life and sexual function of Chinese men during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods An online questionnaire was created and the survey was administered through social media to Chinese adult men. Main Outcome Measure The main end point was the deteriorated erectile function or ejaculatory control ability, defined by self-evaluation or by decreased International Index of Erectile Function-5 items (IIEF-5) scores or increased premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) scores. Results Altogether, 612 questionnaires were collected. About 322 (52.6%) subjects were unmarried. About 8.4% and 8.5% subjects reported deteriorated erectile function or ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation, whereas 31.9% and 17.9% subjects showed decreased IIEF-5 scores or increased PEDT scores. Subjects with deteriorated erectile function by self-evaluation and decreased IIEF-5 scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P = .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic, decreased frequency of sexual life (P < .001 and P < .001) and physical exercise (P = .009 and .007) after the epidemic. Subjects with deteriorated ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation and increased PEDT scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P < .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic. Subjects with decreased frequency of sexual life had reduced income (P < .001), increased anxiety (P < .001) and depression (P < .001). Married subjects had higher proportion of improved depression (P = .048) and increased frequency of sexual life (P = .010). Conclusion During the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased sexual function was present in a certain proportion of adult men, and the risk factors include increased anxiety and depression, and decreased frequency of sexual life.

372,Myocardial injury in a patient with severe coronavirus disease: A case report,"Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can lead to severe disease or death and is characterized by a wide range of mild to severe symptoms. In addition to the lungs, studies have reported the involvement of the stomach, intestine, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the heart. Case report We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who died soon after developing multi-organ failure and myocardial injury due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A 71-year-old man who contracted COVID-19 was admitted to the hospital after presenting with fever for 7 days and developed dyspnea. Following treatment, his respiratory status worsened. Thus, he was transferred to our hospital for intensive care on day 11. Physical examination revealed fever, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and no chest pain. Invasive positive pressure ventilation was initiated for acute respiratory distress syndrome on day 14. On day 15, we observed renal, liver, and coagulation dysfunction, indicating multi-organ failure. Chest radiography did not show clear signs of an increased cardiothoracic ratio or pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of myocardial infarction, which was confirmed by elevated troponin I and creatine kinase levels. The patient's circulatory dynamics did not improve on medication, and he died on day 16. Conclusions We report the case of a patient with severe COVID-19 who died from an exacerbation of myocardial injury. Clinicians should not only evaluate respiration but also assess the heart by performing a 12-lead ECG, echocardiogram, and myocardial injury marker examination.

375,"Prevalence of stress, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background The new coronavirus disease's (COVID-19) high risk of infection can increase the workload of healthcare workers, especially nurses, as they are most of the healthcare workforce. These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I2) statistics. Results A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37–49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32–41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31–39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36–50). Conclusion This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions.

Community-based quarantine can slow down the pandemic growth while adversely affecting population-wide psychological well-being. Affected psychological well-being could potentially influence population compliance in following stipulated community quarantine procedures. Aim The aim was to quantify psychological distress among Greater Jakarta area residents during the community containment period. Objectives The objective was to measure depression, anxiety, and stress levels using the Indonesian version of the DASS-21. Demographic data on sex, education strata, and working/productive-age group were also collected. Methods This cross-sectional observational analytic study employed an online questionnaire involving participants acquired through snowball sampling. The questionnaire comprises two parts: demographic data and psychological distress indicators. Linear regression evaluated psychological distress as a response variable. Results Among 1,205 women and 824 men, our findings suggested male sex, age in the range of 15-24 years, and having a bachelor's degree or professional qualification have a strong association with psychological distress.

384,A commentary on the impact of COVID-19 on engagement of youth with substance use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders,"Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with substance use disorders (SUD) have low rates of engagement and retention in SUD treatment (Mericle et al., 2015). Engagement and retention refers to treatment attendance and regular communication with providers. The reason for this low rate is multifactorial and includes the stigma surrounding SUD and treatment (Bagley, Hadland, Carney, & Saitz, 2017), and challenges accessing developmentally appropriate treatment (Mericle et al., 2015; Sterling, Weisner, Hinman, & Parthasarathy, 2010). Yet engaging AYA early in their trajectory of substance use offers an invaluable opportunity to minimize the short-term and long-term consequences of use (Compton et al., 2019; Levy, Williams, & Prevention, C. on S.

385,Factors influencing social distancing to prevent the community spread of COVID-19 among Chinese adults,"The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020 has been an international public health threat. Early strong social distancing efforts is needed to stop transmission of the virus. The purpose of the present study is to identify individual and environmental factors related to individuals' compliance with the recommended social distancing, as well as the moderating role of social media in influencing individuals' implementation of social distancing. A total of 2130 Chinese adults were surveyed in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses were performed to ascertain the predictors of social distancing. Overall, the majority of respondents (95.6%) reported compliance with social distancing. Women were more likely to practice social distancing compared to men (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.93–5.02). Psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and social media were significant predictors of social distancing after controlling for other individual and environmental factors. Social media moderated the effects of psychological distress on social distancing (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94–0.99). Findings from the study indicates that mental health status and social media are influential factors of social distancing, which have significant implications in enhancing the effectiveness of prevention strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106385,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106385,Scopus,10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106385,2021-02-01,,,
386,Rapid transitional response to the COVID-19 pandemic by opioid agonist treatment programs in Ukraine,"On March 16, 2020, Ukraine's Ministry of Health issued nonspecific interim guidance to continue enrolling patients in opioid agonist therapies (OAT) and transition existing patients to take-home dosing to reduce community COVID-19 transmission. Though the number of OAT patients increased modestly, the proportion receiving take-home dosing increased from 57.5% to 82.2%, which translates on average to 963,952 fewer clinic interactions annually (range: 728,652–1,016,895) and potentially 80,329 (range: 60,721–84,741) fewer hours of in-person clinical encounters. During the transition, narcologists (addiction specialists) expressed concerns about overdoses, the guidance contradicting existing legislation, and patient dropout, either from incarceration or inadequate public transportation. Though clinicians did observe some overdoses, short-term overall mortality remained similar to the previous year. As the country relaxes the interim guidance, we do not know to what extent governmental guidance or clinical practice will change to adopt the new guidance permanently or revert to pre-guidance regulations. Some future considerations that have come from COVID-19 are should dosing schedules continue to be flexible, should clinicians adopt telehealth, and should there be more overdose education and naloxone distribution? OAT delivery has improved and become more efficient, but clinicians should plan long-term should COVID-19 return in the near future. If the new efficiencies are maintained, it will free the workforce to further scale up OAT.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108164,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108164,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108164,2021-02-01,,,
387,"Fatal self-injury in the United States, 1999–2018: Unmasking a national mental health crisis","Background Suicides by any method, plus ‘nonsuicide’ fatalities from drug self-intoxication (estimated from selected forensically undetermined and ‘accidental’ deaths), together represent self-injury mortality (SIM)—fatalities due to mental disorders or distress. SIM is especially important to examine given frequent undercounting of suicides amongst drug overdose deaths. We report suicide and SIM trends in the United States of America (US) during 1999–2018, portray interstate rate trends, and examine spatiotemporal (spacetime) diffusion or spread of the drug self-intoxication component of SIM, with attention to potential for differential suicide misclassification. Methods For this state-based, cross-sectional, panel time series, we used de-identified manner and underlying cause-of-death data for the 50 states and District of Columbia (DC) from CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. Procedures comprised joinpoint regression to describe national trends; Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient to assess interstate SIM and suicide rate congruence; and spacetime hierarchical modelling of the ‘nonsuicide’ SIM component. Findings The national annual average percentage change over the observation period in the SIM rate was 4.3% (95% CI: 3.3%, 5.4%; p<0.001) versus 1.8% (95% CI: 1.6%, 2.0%; p<0.001) for the suicide rate. By 2017/2018, all states except Nebraska (19.9) posted a SIM rate of at least 21.0 deaths per 100,000 population—the floor of the rate range for the top 5 ranking states in 1999/2000. The rank-order correlation coefficient for SIM and suicide rates was 0.82 (p<0.001) in 1999/2000 versus 0.34 (p = 0.02) by 2017/2018. Seven states in the West posted a ≥ 5.0% reduction in their standardised mortality ratios of ‘nonsuicide’ drug fatalities, relative to the national ratio, and 6 states from the other 3 major regions a >6.0% increase (p<0.05). Interpretation Depiction of rising SIM trends across states and major regions unmasks a burgeoning national mental health crisis. Geographic variation is plausibly a partial product of local heterogeneity in toxic drug availability and the quality of medicolegal death investigations. Like COVID-19, the nation will only be able to prevent SIM by responding with collective, comprehensive, systemic approaches.

388,The effect of apnea management on novel coronavirus infection: A study on patients with obstructive sleep apnea,"Objective To assess the frequency of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and the effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) management on COVID-19 among patients with confirmed OSA. Design Cross-sectional telephone interview survey. Setting Academic sleep labs. Participants Iranian adults ≥ 18 years old with confirmed OSA. Results Among 275 participants with OSA, 20% (n = 55) were suspected to have history of COVID-19 but had no positive test, and 18% (n = 51) were in the definite COVID-19 group according to their reported symptoms or confirmed positive test. Having severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index ≥ 30) was associated with an increased risk of definite COVID-19, with an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 2.31 (0.87-5.55) compared to having mild OSA in definite COVID-19 group. Those not undergoing treatment for OSA had an OR (95% CI) of 2.43 (1.26-4.67) for definite COVID-19 compared to those accepting treatment in definite COVID-19 group. Total sleep times (TSTs) were 354, 340, and 320 minutes in healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively; TST was associated with COVID-19 (P-value = .04). Similarly, sleep efficiency (SE) scores were 75.7, 74.2, and 67.9% for the healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively (P-value = .005); Beck Depression scores were 13.8, 13.0, and 17.7, respectively (P-value = .056). Conclusions OSA as a proinflammatory condition with multiple comorbidities may be a contributing factor to developing COVID-19. Greater OSA severity, no treatment for OSA, and lower TST and SE were associated with increased COVID-19 prevalence among patients with OSA.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2020.09.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2020.09.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleh.2020.09.003,2021-02-01,,,
389,Fear and depression linked to COVID-19 exposure A study of adult twins during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Millions of people have been impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. High infection rates and death tolls, combined with social distancing measures, may have unintended psychological consequences on individuals. The goal of this study was to examine the interrelations between COVID-19 exposure, fear of COVID-19, and depression among a community-based sample of adult twins. We further explored whether fear of COVID-19 mediated the association between COVID-19 exposure and depression. 732 same-sex adult twin pairs (78.1% MZ, 21.9% DZ) completed an online survey examining their feelings in May 2020. About one-fifth of the participants reported having any COVID-19 exposure. Most participants (>80%) were somewhat concerned about themselves or their household members being infected by COVID-19. The average depression level was relatively low (M = 0.9 out of 6). We found that COVID-19 exposure was related to increased fears of COVID-19 and depression, and that depressive feelings increased with fear of COVID-19. The correlation between COVID-19 exposure and depression was partially mediated by fear of COVID-19. However, these associations were confounded by familial influences. As society navigates through the pandemic, it is essential to implement public health strategies to help individuals cope with the concerns and fears about COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113699,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113699,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113699,2021-02-01,,,
390,Impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in changes of prevalence of predictive psychiatric disorders among children and adolescents in Bangladesh,"Lockdown, isolation, quarantine and social distancing are proved to be only effective measures to prevent and tackle COVID-19 till date. Unfortunately, these measures have caused physical, economical and mental health problems. Children and adolescents are not immune to the adverse mental health effect due to the new changes. Research around the globe shows children and adolescents are suffering from an increased number of depressive symptoms, clinginess, inattention, irritability and worry. This cross-sectional online-based survey type study was aimed to get a snapshot of the prevalence of predictive psychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent population in Bangladesh before and during lockdown. Validated Bangla parent version of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to assess the psychopathology among subjects. Total sample was 552 aged from 4–17 years. Boy-girl ratio was 1.3:1. Prevalence of any predictive psychiatric disorder before lockdown was 20.5 % and within lockdown was 39.7 % and the difference was highly significant (P < 0.001). Prevalence of emotional, conduct disorder and hyperactivity were also increased significantly during the lockdown period than before. Conduct disorder and hyperactivity were more prevalent among boys both before and within lockdown. In contrast, prevalence of emotional disorder was higher among girls before lockdown but within the lockdown period, the boy-girl prevalence was almost the same. This study shows the new extreme measures to tackle COVID-19 has a disaster impact on mental health of children and adolescents.

391,Psychological distress in North America during COVID-19: The role of pandemic-related stressors,"Rationale The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on lives around the globe. In addition to the primary threat of infection, widespread secondary stressors associated with the pandemic have included social isolation, financial insecurity, resource scarcity, and occupational difficulties. Objective The current study examined the impact of these disruptions on psychological distress during the initial adjustment phase to the pandemic in North America. Method A sample of 2463 residents of the US and Canada completed both baseline and follow-up surveys across several weeks between March and May 2020. Results Those participants perceiving stress related to higher levels of personal threat to health and to the well-being of family members at baseline reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for baseline depressive symptoms. In addition, pandemic-related secondary stressors (social isolation, financial insecurity, occupational difficulty, and resource scarcity) were all independently associated with depressive symptoms at follow-up, controlling for both baseline depression and perceived health threats. The results were robust and held up after controlling for demographic factors. Women, young adults, and those who reported lower income were all at higher risk for subsequent depressive symptoms. Conclusion Findings from the present study can help to identify key groups at risk for mental health problems during the pandemic, and indicate actionable areas for targeted intervention.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113687,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113687,Scopus,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113687,2021-02-01,,,

397,Eating to Cope With the COVID-19 Pandemic and Body Weight Change in Young Adults,"Purpose Life disruptions caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic are particularly salient for young adults. Some young adults may engage in unhealthy eating practices to cope with social distancing and isolation during the pandemic, which could increase incidental weight gain. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of eating to cope with the pandemic with body weight change in young adults before versus after spread of COVID-19. Methods Data included the baseline (October/2018–October/2019) and follow-up (May/2020–July/2020) assessments from an ongoing longitudinal cohort recruited from Southern California. A diverse sample of participants (54% Hispanic; age = 19.72[.47] years; N = 1,820) completed online self-report measures of weight at baseline and follow-up and were given a checklist of pandemic coping behaviors including overeating (yes/no) and eating high fat or sugary foods (yes/no) to cope with social distancing and isolation during the pandemic. Results With and without adjusting for confounders, young adults who did versus did not report overeating to cope with the pandemic gained more weight from baseline to follow-up (5.55 vs. 2.54 lbs). Unhealthy food intake to cope with the pandemic was not associated with weight change. Baseline weight moderated the association of eating coping practices with weight change such that individuals with higher baseline weight gained more weight if they engaged in eating to cope behaviors versus not (p’s≤.001). Conclusions Unhealthy eating behavior to cope with the pandemic and corresponding body weight increases may be occurring in young adults. Interventions to promote healthy eating practices in young adults warrant consideration for weight gain prevention during the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.11.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.11.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.11.011,2021-02-01,,,
398,"Students’ mental health problems before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","The lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic may have exacerbated mental health problems. To what degree mental health may be affected by social isolation is still poorly known. We collected prospective data on students’ mental health in two instances: (i) in October and December 2019, and (ii) 6 months later, in April 2020 amidst the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy and in mid-May/June 2020, after the lifting of lockdown. A total of 358 Italian students aged 18–30 completed socio-demographic questionnaires and the Beck Depression Inventory – 2 (BDI-2), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory – Revised (OCI-R), the Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ), and the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3). We applied multiple regression models to evince any changes in the aforementioned questionnaire scores during and after lockdown with respect to the scores before lockdown. Students reported on average worse depressive symptoms during lockdown than 6 months before isolation (median increase in the BDI-2 score +2; IQR = −3, 6; β = 0.09 ± 0.03, p = 0.005), with students without any established diagnosis of psychopathology being affected the most. The regression models predict that 86.2% (IQR = 67.9, 91.4%) of students would not experience a clinically significant worsening of symptoms, while approximately 6% of our target population could develop more severe depressive symptoms. This study supports the view that depressive symptomatology may be aggravated during lockdown, but also highlights that after the lifting of lockdown any changes quickly vanished, as the BDI-2 scores were not different from the ones reported before lockdown.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.045,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.045,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.045,2021-02-01,,,
399,The effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing relaxation training for improving sleep quality among nursing staff during the COVID-19 outbreak: a before and after study,"Objectives Recent studies have demonstrated that first-line nurses involved in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) crisis may experience sleep disturbances. As breathing relaxation techniques can improve sleep quality, anxiety, and depression, the current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing relaxation training (DBRT) for improving sleep quality among nurses in Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods This study used a quasi-experimental (before and after) intervention strategy, with 151 first-line nurses from four wards in Leishenshan hospital. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) to evaluate the effectiveness of DBRT before and after the intervention. Data were examined using the Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, and paired t-test. Results A total of 140 nurses completed the DBRT sessions. First-line nurses achieved significant reductions in global sleep quality (p < 0.01), subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001), sleep latency (p < 0.01), sleep duration (p < 0.001), sleep disturbances (p < 0.001), habitual sleep efficiency (p = 0.015), daytime dysfunction (p = 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001). There were no significant reductions in the use of sleeping medication (p = 0.134) and depression (p = 0.359). Conclusion DBRT is a useful non-pharmacological treatment for improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety among first-line nurses involved in the COVID-19 outbreak.

Methods This is a prospective observational study involving pediatric patients with epilepsy with neurocognitive and emotional comorbidities. Included patients were admitted to our hospital between August 2019 and February 2020 for epilepsy and neuropsychiatric assessment, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) questionnaires were filled in by parents. Those patients and their families accepted to participate in a phone follow-up visit in April–May 2020 and to refill CBCL and Parenting Stress Index–Short Form (PSI-SF) questionnaires. Descriptive statistics for demographic and clinical data, CBCL questionnaire scores before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and PSI-SF scores have been computed. Moreover, results of a short phone survey on the psychological burden during COVID lockdown have been reported. Results This study provides the parental-proxy report of emotional and behavioral profile changes of 23 pediatric patients with epilepsy and neurocognitive and emotional comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns for therapy monitoring at the time of lockdown emerged in 43% of families, and 30% of patients showed worries for an altered contact with the referring medical team. Patients with neurocognitive comorbidities were more likely to exhibit behavioral problems, especially externalizing problems compared with patients with a diagnosis of anxiety/depression.

401,Adapting and avoiding coping strategies for women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for people living with cancer, impacting not only physical health but psychological well-being. The psychological response affects the individual as well as the community and can persist long after the outbreak. We aim to assess coping strategies employed by women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Women with a current or prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey which included a query about coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed from March 30th through April 13, 2020 through survivor networks and social media. Results: Six hundred and three women visited the survey website during the study period and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. Four hundred and eight (73.5%) provided information on coping strategies utilized during COVID-19. Among those who responded, the median age was 58 years (range 20–85) and 150 participants (40.8%) were undergoing active cancer treatment. Commonly utilized adaptive coping strategies included emotional support (159, 39.0%), self care (148, 36.3%), hobbies (139, 34.1%), planning (87, 21.3%), positive reframing (54, 13.2%), religion (50, 12.3%) and instrumental support (38, 9.3%). Many participants also relied on avoidance coping strategies including self distraction (111, 27.2%) and substance use (19, 4.7%). Conclusions: Most ovarian cancer survivors are using adaptive, problem-focused coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, however many are practicing avoidance strategies as well. As coping mechanisms profoundly impact quality of life, oncology providers must assist patients in identifying coping strategies that optimize physical and psychological well-being.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.11.017,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.11.017,Scopus,10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.11.017,2021-02-01,,,
402,A longitudinal observation of general psychopathology before the COVID-19 outbreak and during lockdown in Italy,"Objective Italy has been largely involved by the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed at evaluating the impact of the lockdown during the pandemic on mental health adopting both a longitudinal and a cross-sectional design. Accordingly, the study investigated general psychopathology a few weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak (T0) and during lockdown (T1), and the associations between lockdown-related environmental conditions, self-perceived worsening in daily living and psychopathology. Methods 130 subjects (aged 18–60 years) were included in the longitudinal design, and an additional subsample of 541 subjects was recruited for the in-lockdown evaluation. Socio-demographic data and the Brief Symptom Inventory were collected both at T0 and T1. Moreover, at T1 an online survey was administered for the evaluation of lockdown-related environmental conditions and self-perceived variations in daily living induced by quarantine, along with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Results Longitudinal analysis showed that phobic anxiety and depressive symptoms increased at T1 as compared with T0, whereas interpersonal sensitivity and paranoid ideation decreased. Pre-existing general psychopathology predicted COVID-19-related post-traumatic symptomatology. Cross-sectional analyses underlined that self-perceived deteriorations in various areas of daily living were associated with general and post-traumatic psychopathology, and with several lockdown-related conditions, especially economic damage. Conclusion The present study underlined a different trend of increased internalizing and decreased interpersonal symptoms during COVID-19 quarantine in Italy. Furthermore, the results showed that subjects with pre-existing psychopathology and those reporting economic damage during the pandemic were more likely to develop deterioration of their mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110328,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110328,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110328,2021-02-01,,,
403,Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown in Poland. Specific predictors and differences in symptoms severity,"Background Previous studies carried out in different countries have indicated that young adults experienced higher levels of emotional distress, in the form of depressive and anxiety symptoms, than older age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about which pandemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. Purpose The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in four age groups in the Polish population during the COVID-19 lockdown; (ii) differences in perceived difficulties related to the pandemic in these groups; and (iii) which factors and difficulties related to the pandemic are the best predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method A total of 1115 participants (aged 18–85) took part in the study. The sample was representative of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed the following online: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, a Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, a Social Support Scale, and a Scale of Pandemic-Related Difficulties. Results Younger age groups (18–29 and 30–44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45–59 and 60–85 years). Household relationship difficulties were among the most significant predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus was one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18 and 29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms exclusively in the youngest group. Conclusions The youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members are the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. It is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the various challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152222,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152222,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152222,2021-02-01,,,
404,"A rapid review of the pathoetiology, presentation, and management of delirium in adults with COVID-19","Background COVID-19 causes significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the high prevalence of delirium and delirium-related symptoms in COVID-19 patients, data and evidence-based recommendations on the pathophysiology and management of delirium are limited. Objective We conducted a rapid review of COVID-19-related delirium literature to provide a synthesis of literature on the prevalence, pathoetiology, and management of delirium in these patients. Methods Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, LitCovid, WHO-COVID-19, and Web of Science electronic databases were conducted. Grey literature was also reviewed, including preprint servers, archives, and websites of relevant organizations. Search results were limited to the English language. We included literature focused on adults with COVID-19 and delirium. Papers were excluded if they did not mention signs or symptoms of delirium. Results 229 studies described prevalence, pathoetiology, and/or management of delirium in adults with COVID-19. Delirium was rarely assessed with validated tools. Delirium affected >50% of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. The etiology of COVID-19 delirium is likely multifactorial, with some evidence of direct brain effect. Prevention remains the cornerstone of management in these patients. To date, there is no evidence to suggest specific pharmacological strategies. Discussion Delirium is common in COVID-19 and may manifest from both indirect and direct effects on the central nervous system. Further research is required to investigate contributing mechanisms. As there is limited empirical literature on delirium management in COVID-19, management with non-pharmacological measures and judicious use of pharmacotherapy is suggested.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110350,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110350,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110350,2021-02-01,,,

409,"Dyspnea, Acute Respiratory Failure, Psychological Trauma, and Post-ICU Mental Health: A Caution and a Call for Research","Dyspnea is an uncomfortable sensation with the potential to cause psychological trauma. Patients presenting with acute respiratory failure, particularly when tidal volume is restricted during mechanical ventilation, may experience the most distressing form of dyspnea known as air hunger. Air hunger activates brain pathways known to be involved in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. These conditions are considered part of the post-intensive care syndrome. These sequelae may be even more prevalent among patients with ARDS. Low tidal volume, a mainstay of modern therapy for ARDS, is difficult to avoid and is likely to cause air hunger despite sedation. Adjunctive neuromuscular blockade does not prevent or relieve air hunger, but it does prevent the patient from communicating discomfort to caregivers. Consequently, paralysis may also contribute to the development of PTSD. Although research has identified post-ARDS PTSD as a cause for concern, and investigators have taken steps to quantify the burden of disease, there is little information to guide mechanical ventilation strategies designed to reduce its occurrence. We suggest such efforts will be more successful if they are directed at the known mechanisms of air hunger. Investigation of the antidyspnea effects of sedative and analgesic drugs commonly used in the ICU and their impact on post-ARDS PTSD symptoms is a logical next step. Although in practice we often accept negative consequences of life-saving therapies as unavoidable, we must understand the negative sequelae of our therapies and work to minimize them under our primary directive to “first, do no harm” to patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.09.251,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.09.251,Scopus,10.1016/j.chest.2020.09.251,2021-02-01,,,

Methods We searched MEDLINE(R) ALL (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), Embase and Embase Classic (Ovid), Emcare Nursing (Ovid), and AgeLine (EBSCO) for research that quantified an aspect of social connection among LTC residents; we limited searches to English-language articles published from database inception to search date (July 2019). For the current analysis, we included studies that reported (1) the association between social connection and a mental health outcome, (2) the association between a modifiable risk factor and social connection, or (3) intervention studies with social connection as an outcome. From studies in (2) and (3), we identified strategies that could be implemented and adapted by LTC residents, families and staff during COVID-19 and included the articles that informed these strategies. Results We included 133 studies in our review. We found 61 studies that tested the association between social connection and a mental health outcome. We highlighted 12 strategies, informed by 72 observational and intervention studies, that might help LTC residents, families, and staff build and maintain social connection for LTC residents. Conclusions and Implications Published research conducted among LTC residents has linked good social connection to better mental health outcomes. Observational and intervention studies provide some evidence on approaches to address social connection in this population. Although further research is needed, it does not obviate the need to act given the sudden and severe impact of COVID-19 on social connection in LTC residents.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.11.025,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.11.025,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamda.2020.11.025,2021-02-01,,,

412,Different prevalence trend of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers and general public before and after the peak of COVID-19 occurred in China: A meta-analysis,"Objective We aim to evaluate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among general public and healthcare workers during COVID-19 in China and the changes of prevalence before and after the peak of the epidemic occurred. Methods Studies were searched from following database: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WANGFANG DATA, from inception to 1 st May 2020. Random-effects model was applied to pool the prevalence. Comparative analysis was also applied to evaluate the changes of prevalence before and after the peak of the epidemic occurred. Results 34 articles were finally included. Prevalence of depression and anxiety was higher among healthcare worker than general public. Among general public, 26 % (95 %CI: 17 %–36 %) were suffering from depression and 22 % (95 %CI: 15 %–30 %) were having anxiety during COVID-19, while the prevalence of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers was 31 % (95 %CI: 25 %–37 %) and 40 % (95 %CI: 33 %–46 %) respectively. Comparative analysis showed healthcare workers (depression: 40 %, anxiety: 38 %) had higher percentage of having depression and anxiety than the general public (depression: 33 %, anxiety: 24 %) before the peak. Then a descended prevalence among healthcare workers (depression: 22 %, anxiety: 22 %) was detected compared with that before, while the prevalence among the general public raised (depression: 62 %, anxiety: 44 %) after the peak occurred. Conclusion The COVID-19 epidemic had a potential psychiatric impact on general public and healthcare workers in China, which is more severer among healthcare workers. However, the psychiatric status of the general public trend to deteriorated, while healthcare workers trend to improve after the peak of epidemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102547,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102547,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102547,2021-02-01,,,
413,“It's an emotional roller coaster… But sometimes it's fucking awesome”: Meaning and motivation of work for peers in overdose response environments in British Columbia,"Background The province of British Columbia (BC), Canada is amid dual public health emergencies in which the overdose epidemic declared in 2016 has been exacerbated by restrictions imposed by the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Experiential workers, commonly known as ‘peers’ (workers with past or present drug use experience) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives and are essential in creating safe spaces for people who use drugs (PWUD) in harm reduction. Working in overdose response environments can be stressful, with lasting emotional and mental health effects. There is limited knowledge about the personal meaning that experiential workers derive from their work, which serve as motivators for them to take on these often-stressful roles. Methods This project used a community-based qualitative research design. The research was based at two organizations in BC. Eight experiential worker-led focus groups were conducted (n = 31) where participants spoke about their roles, positive aspects of their jobs, challenges they face, and support needs in harm reduction work. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using interpretative description to uncover the meaning derived from experiential work. Results Three themes emerged from focus group data that describe the meanings which serve as motivators for experiential workers to continue working in overdose response environments: (1) A sense of purpose from helping others; (2) Being an inspiration for others, and; (3) A sense of belonging. Conclusion Despite the frequent hardships and loss that accompany overdose response work, experiential workers identified important aspects that give their work meaning. These aspects of their work may help to protect workers from the emotional harms associated with stressful work as well as the stigma of substance use. Recognizing the importance of experiential work and its role in the lives of PWUD can help inform and strengthen organizational supports.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103015,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103015,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103015,2021-02-01,,,

416,Prevalence and associated factors of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and has caused traumatic experience for nurses worldwide. However, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in nurses, and how psychosocial factors influence nurses in this public crisis are unknown. Objectives To determine the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of nurses and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses in China during the outbreak. Design A cross-sectional study. Settings and participants A total of 3,228 nurses in Sichuan Province and Wuhan City were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were invited to complete the questionnaire through WeChat from January 27 to February 3, 2020. Methods A self-reported questionnaire combining depression and anxiety scale was used to collect data anonymously. Binary and multivariate logistic regression was applied to measure the odds of psychosocial factors of anxiety and depression and perceived health, respectively. Results The total incidence of depression (34.3%) and anxiety (18.1%) during the COVID-19 outbreak was lower than that during the SARS outbreak; however, the rate of depression in our study (47.1%) was high and similar in a recent study (50.4%) about the health care workers exposed to COVID-19 in China. The results indicated that COVID-19-related stress, relationship quality with family, and demographic characteristics were associated with depression, anxiety, and perceived health status. Furthermore, the prevalence of depression was similar between nurses working in low-risk COVID-19 wards was as high as working in high-risk COVID-19 wards (OR, 1.078; 95% CI, 0.784–1.481). Conclusions Our study revealed the high prevalence of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19. COVID-19 factors and psychosocial factors were associated with mental health of nurses. The results suggest that hospitals should implement effective mental health promotion programs focused on occupational safety and family support to improve the well-being of nurses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103809,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103809,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103809,2021-02-01,,,

419,"COVID-19 Pandemic and the Lived Experience of Surgical Residents, Fellows, and Early-Career Surgeons in the American College of Surgeons","Background To better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected surgical trainees' and early-career surgeons' professional and personal experiences, a survey of the membership of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Resident and Associate Society (RAS) and Young Fellows Association (YFA) was performed. Study Design An anonymous online survey was disseminated to members of RAS and YFA. Descriptive analyses were performed and factors associated with depression and burnout were examined with univariate and multivariable stepwise logistic regression. Results Of the RAS/YFA membership of 21,385, there were 1,160 respondents. The majority of respondents (96%) reported the COVID-19 pandemic having a negative impact on their clinical experience, with 84% of residents reporting a > 50% reduction in operative volume and inability to meet minimum case requirements. Respondents also reported negative impacts on personal wellness. Nearly one-third reported inadequate access to personal protective equipment, and depression and burnout were pervasive (≥21% of respondents reported yes to every screening symptom). On multivariable analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.54 for depression, OR 1.47 for burnout) and lack of wellness resources (OR 1.55 for depression, OR 1.44 for burnout) predicted depression and burnout. Access to adequate personal protective equipment was protective against burnout (OR 0.52). Conclusions These data demonstrate a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of residents and early-career surgeons. Actionable items from these data include mitigation of burnout and depression through increasing personal protective equipment access and provision of wellness programs, with a particular focus on high-risk groups.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.09.026,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.09.026,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.09.026,2021-02-01,,,
420,Psychological and Sexual Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Egypt: Are Women Suffering More?,"Introduction Psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic include pandemic triggered feelings of fear, uncertainty, and anxiety added to the effects of restricting the population's activities in lockdown. Aim We aimed to study the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on sexual satisfaction of females and males in Egypt and to evaluate possible predictive factors. Methods Married men and females in Egypt were invited to respond to an online questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed medical history, socioeconomic status, sexual performance satisfaction before and during the lockdown in addition to validated Arabic questionnaires for depression, sexual function in males and females, and sexual satisfaction (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function-5, Index of Sexual Satisfaction, respectively). Main outcome measure The main outcome measures were frequency of depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and sexual satisfaction in males and females during COVID-19 lockdown. Results A total of 479 females and 217 males completed the questionnaire. Sexual satisfaction was significantly higher before (91.2%, 73.5%) than during lockdown (70.5%, 56.2%) in both males and females, respectively. During lockdown, significantly more males (70.5%) reported being satisfied with their sexual performance than females (56.2%) (P < .001). More than half of the male subjects (68.2%) had no erectile dysfunction while 97.3% females scored ≤26.5 on the Female Sexual Function Index scale suggestive of sexual difficulties. Sexual stress was significantly greater in females (70.8%) than males (63.1%). Educational level, occupation, anxiety, and erectile dysfunction were independently associated with sexual stress in males. Being a housewife or unemployed, husband's age >35 years, marriage duration of 5-10 years, anxiety, and female sexual dysfunction were predictors of sexual relation stress in females. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower sexual satisfaction in both genders. Females however suffered more anxiety and depression and thereby greater risk of sexual function difficulties and sexual dissatisfaction. Intervention strategies in order to lessen the suffering of affected individuals particularly after the pandemic are recommended. Omar SS, Dawood W, Eid N, et al.

425,Does public fear that bats spread COVID-19 jeopardize bat conservation?,"With >1 400 species, bats comprise the second-largest order of mammals and provide critical ecological services as insect consumers, pollinators, and seed dispersers. Yet, bats are frequently associated with infectious human diseases such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola. As early as the end of January 2020, several virological studies have suggested bats as a probable origin for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. How does the public view the role of bats in COVID-19? Here we report pilot data collected shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19 using two online surveys, combined with a conservation intervention experiment, primarily on people who are receiving or have received higher education in China. We found that 84% of the participants of an online survey (n = 13 589) have misunderstood the relationship between bats and COVID-19, which strengthened negative attitudes towards bats. Knowledge of bats, gender, and education level of the participants affected their attitudes towards bats. Participants who indicated a better knowledge of bats had a more positive attitude towards bats. The proportion of female participants who had negative attitudes towards bats was higher than that of male participants. Participants with a higher education level indicated a more positive attitude towards bats after the outbreak of COVID-19. A specially prepared bat conservation lecture improved peoples' knowledge of bats and the positive attitudes, but failed to correct the misconception that bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans directly. We suggest that the way virologists frame the association of bats with diseases, the countless frequently inaccurate media coverages, and the natural perceptual bias of bats carrying and transmitting diseases to humans contributed to the misunderstandings. This probably led to a rise in the events of evicting bats from dwellings and structures by humans and the legislative proposal for culling disease-relevant wildlife in China. A better understanding of the relationship between disease, wildlife and human health could help guide the public and policymakers in an improved program for bat conservation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108952,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108952,Scopus,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108952,2021-02-01,,,
426,ACE2 and FURIN variants are potential predictors of SARS-CoV-2 outcome: A time to implement precision medicine against COVID-19,"The severity of the new COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is strikingly variable in different global populations. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor, TMPRSS2 protease, and FURIN peptidase to invade human cells. Here, we investigated 1,378 whole-exome sequences of individuals from the Middle Eastern populations (Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran) to explore natural variations in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN genes. We identified two activating variants (K26R and N720D) in the ACE2 gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle Eastern, East Asian, and African populations. We postulate that K26R can activate ACE2 and facilitate binding to S-protein RBD while N720D enhances TMPRSS2 cutting and, ultimately, viral entry. We also detected deleterious variants in FURIN that are frequent in the Middle Eastern but not in the European populations. This study highlights specific genetic variations in the ACE2 and FURIN genes that may explain SARS-CoV-2 clinical disparity. We showed structural evidence of the functionality of these activating variants that increase the SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness. Finally, our data illustrate a significant correlation between ACE2 variants identified in people from Middle Eastern origins that can be further explored to explain the variation in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates globally.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06133,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06133,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06133,2021-02-01,,,

Results A total of 19 articles were included in the final meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of anxiety was 42 % (95 %CI 26 %–57 %) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 99.6 %). The overall prevalence of depression was 25 % (95 %CI 20 %–31 %) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 97.9 %). Age, family economic status, social support, and physical activity seem to correlate with the mental health status of pregnant women. Conclusion The prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women increased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic. Pregnant women are more concerned about others than themselves during COVID-19, and younger pregnant women seem to be more prone to anxiety, while social support and physical activity can reduce the likelihood of anxiety and depression.

440,Safety signals for QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes associated with azithromycin with or without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine,"Background Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not assessed potential risks. Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of ≥2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016,2021-02-01,,,

450,"Diurnal emotions, valence and the coronavirus lockdown analysis in public spaces","A large-scale analysis of diurnal and seasonal mood cycles in global social networks has been performed successfully over the past ten years using Twitter, Facebook and blogs. This study describes the application of remote biometric technologies to such investigations on a large scale for the first time. The performance of this research was under real conditions producing results that conform to natural human diurnal and seasonal rhythm patterns. The derived results of this, 208 million data research on diurnal emotions, valence and facial temperature correlate with the results of an analogical Twitter research performed worldwide (UK, Australia, US, Canada, Latin America, North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia). It is established that diurnal valence and sadness were correlated with one another both prior to and during the period of the coronavirus crisis, and that there are statistically significant relationships between the values of diurnal happiness, sadness, valence and facial temperature and the numbers of their data.

451,"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown policy on homicide, suicide, and motor vehicle deaths in Peru","Although lockdown measures to stop COVID-19 have direct effects on disease transmission, their impact on violent and accidental deaths remains unknown. Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.22 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: −14.45, −9.98) and 3.55 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-4.81, −2.30). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was 2.5 the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in homicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 6.66 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:3.18, 10.15). External deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in homicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106331,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106331,Scopus,10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106331,2021-02-01,,,

454,Psychological correlates of poor sleep quality among U.S. young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective Uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in problematic sleep that can lead to negative effects on overall health. This unprecedented and stressful time can be even more detrimental for young adults with pre-existing mental health conditions. The purpose of this study is to investigate potential risk factors (i.e., current mental health symptoms, and COVID-19-related grief and worry) on sleep quality of U.S. young adults during the initial months of the global pandemic. Method This cross-sectional study examined 908 young adults in the weeks following the declaration of the coronavirus pandemic as a national emergency by the United States. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses examined depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as COVID-19-related grief and worry as predictors of young adults’ sleep quality. Results Young adults experienced high rates of sleep problems during the first two months (April to May 2020) of the pandemic. Depressive and anxiety symptoms appear to be predictors of sleep quality regardless of any pre-existing diagnosis. Furthermore, high levels of PTSD symptoms and COVID-19-related worry were associated with young adults’ poor sleep. Conclusions Our findings point to possible psychological factors that uniquely explain young adults’ poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. This study shed new light on how the COVID-19 pandemic might affect the sleep behaviors of young adults without a pre-existing mental health diagnosis.

456,"Increased mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption during the spring of 2020. Many college students were told to leave campus at spring break and to complete the semester remotely. This study evaluates effects of this disruption on student well-being. Measures of psychological symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use during the pandemic were completed by 148 students in spring 2020 and 352 students in fall 2020 at a university in the southeastern U.S. Results from both cohorts were compared to 240 students who completed the same measures in the fall 2019 semester. Participants in spring 2020 reported more mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use than did pre-pandemic participants and worry about COVID-19 was negatively associated with well-being. By fall 2020 symptoms had largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. In general, White students reported a greater effect of the pandemic on well-being than did African American students. Young adults appear to be less vulnerable to the most serious medical complications associated with COVID-19, but nonetheless experience psychological effects from the pandemic.

460,Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: retrospective cohort studies of 62 354 COVID-19 cases in the USA,"Background Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62 354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69·8 million patients. TriNetX included 62 354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between Jan 20, and Aug 1, 2020. We created cohorts of patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a range of other health events. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for severity of illness. We measured the incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for psychiatric disorders, dementia, and insomnia, during the first 14 to 90 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19. Findings In patients with no previous psychiatric history, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with increased incidence of a first psychiatric diagnosis in the following 14 to 90 days compared with six other health events (HR 2·1, 95% CI 1·8–2·5 vs influenza; 1·7, 1·5–1·9 vs other respiratory tract infections; 1·6, 1·4–1·9 vs skin infection; 1·6, 1·3–1·9 vs cholelithiasis; 2·2, 1·9–2·6 vs urolithiasis, and 2·1, 1·9–2·5 vs fracture of a large bone; all p<0·0001). The HR was greatest for anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia. We observed similar findings, although with smaller HRs, when relapses and new diagnoses were measured. The incidence of any psychiatric diagnosis in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 18·1% (95% CI 17·6–18·6), including 5·8% (5·2–6·4) that were a first diagnosis. The incidence of a first diagnosis of dementia in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 1·6% (95% CI 1·2–2·1) in people older than 65 years. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (relative risk 1·65, 95% CI 1·59–1·71; p<0·0001). This risk was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but we cannot exclude possible residual confounding by socioeconomic factors. Interpretation Survivors of COVID-19 appear to be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, and a psychiatric diagnosis might be an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Although preliminary, our findings have implications for clinical services, and prospective cohort studies are warranted.

461,Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the pediatric population from the family and community perspective,"Partiendo del informe sobre la situación de la COVID-19 en España, del 3 de abril del 2020, los casos confirmados ascienden a 117.710, de los que 343 tienen una edad inferior a 14 años (< 1%). Es fundamental conocer la especificidad de este proceso en la población infantil, así como las recomendaciones específicas para una adecuada prevención y cuidado de los niños durante la pandemia por la COVID-19. Este artículo tiene como objetivo analizar la evidencia científica sobre las recomendaciones específicas para la atención pediátrica en casos de COVID-19 desde el ámbito familiar y comunitario. Se han seleccionado y analizado las principales recomendaciones y medidas preventivas en los entornos de Atención Primaria de salud y el domicilio desde un enfoque integrador dónde se incluyen los aspectos biopsicosociales del niño durante el confinamiento. La importancia de los cuidados de la infancia frente a la enfermedad radican sobre todo en asegurar las correctas medidas de prevención del contagio por la condición de actuar como posibles portadores durante un período de incubación de hasta 21 días. La recomendación es que los niños participen activamente en las acciones preventivas habituales para la contención de la expansión de la enfermedad. A nivel domiciliario, el aislamiento supone un importante reto para las familias donde se presentan manifestaciones de incertidumbre, miedo e indefensión ante los cambios y entre las recomendaciones se encuentran establecer rutinas orden mediante horarios de actividades y ocio unido a las medidas de higiene. Dada la rapidez con la que se ha producido la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2, existen pocas evidencias del impacto en niños en España por el momento. Es necesario desarrollar estudios específicos sobre prevención y tratamiento en la edad pediátrica para mejorar las recomendaciones disponibles. Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (< 1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures. Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment.

468,Depression and anxiety symptoms are associated with problematic smartphone use under the COVID-19 epidemic: The mediation models,"COVID-19 epidemic has brought wide psychological impacts on the young adults. To investigate the depression and anxiety symptoms and their associations with problematic smartphone use under the COVID-19 epidemic, a total of 847 Chinese undergraduate students joined in this study and were measured with their levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, resilience, perceived social support, the sense of school belonging and problematic smartphone use. Results showed that among the Chinese undergraduate students, the disorder rates of depression and anxiety symptoms were 29.16% and 46.64% respectively, and their symptoms ranged from mild to extreme severe. Depression and anxiety symptoms both positively predicted problematic smartphone use. Resilience, perceived social support and the sense of school belonging partially mediated both associations; resilience and the sense of school belonging exerted buffering effects, while perceived social support exacerbated the impacts. The current study advanced our understanding of the COVID-19 impacts and furthermore, suggested the protective factors for mitigating these impacts.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105875,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105875,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105875,2021-02-01,,,

471,Home garden use during COVID-19: Associations with physical and mental wellbeing in older adults,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of people's lives. Lockdown measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have been more stringent for those aged over 70, at highest risk for the disease. Here, we examine whether home garden usage is associated with self-reported mental and physical wellbeing in older adults, during COVID-19 lockdown in Scotland. This study analysed data from 171 individuals (mean age 84 ± 0.5 years) from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study who completed an online survey approximately two months after lockdown commenced (May/June, 2020), and reported having access to a home garden. The survey also included items on garden activities (gardening, relaxing), frequency of garden usage during lockdown, and measures of self-rated physical health, emotional and mental health, anxiety about COVID-19, and sleep quality. Ordinal regression models were adjusted for sex, living alone, education, occupational social class, anxiety and depressive symptoms, body mass index, and history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Neither gardening nor relaxing in the garden were associated with health outcomes. However, higher frequency of garden usage during lockdown was associated with better self-rated physical health (P = 0.005), emotional and mental health (P = 0.04), sleep quality (P = 0.03), and a composite health score (P = 0.001), after adjusting for covariates. None of the garden measures were associated with perceived change in physical health, mental and emotional health, or sleep quality, from pre-lockdown levels. The results of the current study provide support for positive health benefits of spending time in a garden—though associations may be bidirectional—and suggest that domestic gardens could be a potential health resource during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101545,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101545,Scopus,10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101545,2021-02-01,,,

475,Socioeconomic factors analysis for COVID-19 US reopening sentiment with Twitter and census data,"Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users (e.g., positive, negative) towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel patterns due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 50 States of the US and Washington D.C, the capital city of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of family members and high income are less interested in reopening the economy. The accuracy of the model is reasonable (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi-squared test indicates that this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides clear insights for public and corporate policymakers on potential areas to allocate resources, and directional guidance on potential policy options they can undertake to improve socioeconomic conditions, to mitigate the impact of pandemic in the current situation, and in the future as well.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06200,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06200,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06200,2021-02-01,,,

477,"The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with and without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders: a longitudinal study of three Dutch case-control cohorts","Background The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in people with pre-existing mental health disorders is unclear. In three psychiatry case-control cohorts, we compared the perceived mental health impact and coping and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic between people with and without lifetime depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. Methods Between April 1 and May 13, 2020, online questionnaires were distributed among the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association cohorts, including people with (n=1181) and without (n=336) depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The questionnaire contained questions on perceived mental health impact, fear of COVID-19, coping, and four validated scales assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness used in previous waves during 2006–16. Number and chronicity of disorders were based on diagnoses in previous waves. Linear regression and mixed models were done. Findings The number and chronicity of disorders showed a positive graded dose–response relation, with greater perceived impact on mental health, fear, and poorer coping. Although people with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders scored higher on all four symptom scales than did individuals without these mental health disorders, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, they did not report a greater increase in symptoms during the pandemic. In fact, people without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders showed a greater increase in symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas individuals with the greatest burden on their mental health tended to show a slight symptom decrease. Interpretation People with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders are experiencing a detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires close monitoring in clinical practice. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their prepandemic levels.

The lockdown had serious implications on mental health, resulting in psychological problems including frustration, stress, and depression. In order to explore the impacts of this pandemic on the lives of students, we conducted a survey of a total of 1182 individuals of different age groups from various educational institutes in Delhi- National Capital Region (NCR), India. The article identified the following as the impact of COVID-19 on the students of different age groups: time spent on online classes and self-study, medium used for learning, sleeping habits, daily fitness routine, and the subsequent effects on weight, social life, and mental health. Moreover, our research found that in order to deal with stress and anxiety, participants adopted different coping mechanisms and also sought help from their near ones.

We used nationally-representative data to assess dispensing of select substance use and mental health medications during the pandemic in the U.S. Methods IQVIA Total Patient Tracker data were used to calculate U.S. monthly numbers of unique patients dispensed buprenorphine, extended-release (ER) intramuscular naltrexone, naloxone, selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and for comparison, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) between January 2019-May 2020. Forecasted estimates of number of unique patients dispensed medications, generated by exponential smoothing statistical forecasting, were compared to actual numbers of patients by month to examine access during mitigation measures (March 2020-May 2020). Results Between March 2020-May 2020, numbers of unique patients dispensed buprenorphine and numbers dispensed naloxone were within forecasted estimates. Numbers dispensed ER intramuscular naltrexone were significantly below forecasted estimates in March 2020 (-1039; 95 %CI:-1528 to -550), April 2020 (-2139; 95 %CI:-2629 to -1650), and May 2020 (-2498; 95 %CI:-2987 to -2009). Numbers dispensed antidepressants and benzodiazepines were significantly above forecasted estimates in March 2020 (977,063; 95 %CI:351,384 to 1,602,743 and 450,074; 95 % CI:189,999 to 710,149 additional patients, respectively), but were within forecasted estimates in April 2020-May 2020.

486,Short-term outpatient follow-up of COVID-19 patients: A multidisciplinary approach,"Background Short-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients reveals pulmonary dysfunction, myocardial damage and severe psychological distress. Little is known of the burden of these sequelae, and there are no clear recommendations for follow-up of COVID-19 patients. In this multi-disciplinary evaluation, cardiopulmonary function and psychological impairment after hospitalization for COVID-19 are mapped. Methods We evaluated patients at our outpatient clinic 6 weeks after discharge. Cardiopulmonary function was measured by echocardiography, 24-hours ECG monitoring and pulmonary function testing. Psychological adjustment was measured using questionnaires and semi-structured clinical interviews. A comparison was made between patients admitted to the general ward and Intensive care unit (ICU), and between patients with a high versus low functional status. Findings Eighty-one patients were included of whom 34 (41%) had been admitted to the ICU. New York Heart Association class II-III was present in 62% of the patients. Left ventricular function was normal in 78% of patients. ICU patients had a lower diffusion capacity (mean difference 12,5% P = 0.01), lower forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity (mean difference 14.9%; P<0.001; 15.4%; P<0.001; respectively). Risk of depression, anxiety and PTSD were 17%, 5% and 10% respectively and similar for both ICU and non-ICU patients. Interpretation Overall, most patients suffered from functional limitations. Dyspnea on exertion was most frequently reported, possibly related to decreased DLCOc. This could be caused by pulmonary fibrosis, which should be investigated in long-term follow-up.

Methods Seventy-six older adults (N = 46 with PTSD and N = 30 trauma-exposed comparison subjects [TE]) for whom prepandemic data were available were interviewed between April 1 and May 8, 2020 to quantify depressive (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD]) and PTSD symptom (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist [PCL-5]) levels. Group differences in baseline characteristics as well as pre-post pandemic symptom levels were examined, and participant characteristics were assessed as moderators of symptom change. Results Compared to TEs, individuals with PTSD more often reported living alone and experiencing a physical illness (χ2 = 5.1, df = 1, p = 0.02). PCL-5 scores among individuals with PTSD decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic by 7.1 points (t(69) = -3.5, p = 0.0008), whereas the TE group did not change significantly. Overall no significant differences in HRSD were found between groups, but a race or ethnicity variable was found to moderate HRSD symptom change. Non-black or Hispanic individuals with PTSD experienced significantly increased HRSD scores during the pandemic compared to black or Hispanic PTSD participants. Conclusion The findings are indicative of complexity in the responses of older individuals with PTSD to further stressful life events as well as possibly unique aspects to the COVID-19 pandemic as a stressor. Sources of resilience may exist based on experience with prior traumas as well as increasing age promoting more adaptive coping styles.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.010,2021-02-01,,,

Nine hundred ninety-two parents of children and adolescents with ADHD filled out an anonymous online survey through the ADHD family association website. The survey investigated the degree of severity of six emotional and mood states (sadness, boredom, little enjoyment/interest, irritability, temper tantrums, anxiety) and five disrupted behaviours (verbal and physical aggression, argument, opposition, restlessness) based on their frequency/week (absent; low: 1–2 days/week; moderate: 3–4 days/week; severe: 5–7 days/week) before and during the lockdown. Important fluctuations were found in all dimensions during the lockdown independently by the severity degree. Subjects with previous low severity degree of these behaviors significantly worsened in almost all dimensions during the lockdown. On the contrary, ADHD patients with moderate and severe degree showed important improvement during the lockdown. Little enjoyment/interests and boredom resulted the dimensions more strongly affected by the condition of restriction, overall in children.

The healthcare employees taking part in the pandemic will eventually be affected by the process. The aim of the study is to determine the levels of the anxiety, depression, and stress of the healthcare employees during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. As the data collection tool, an e-survey was used. In the first section, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used. In the second section of the survey, the problems experienced by the healthcare employees during the pandemic and their working media were aimed to be defined. In the last section, the socio-demographic features of the employees were investigated. 2076 healthcare employees participated in the study. The results showed that the major cause of the anxiety or stress among healthcare employees comes from the fear to contaminate the COVID-19 virus to their families (86.9%). It was observed that the levels of depression, anxiety and stress of female employees are higher than that of male employees (p < 0.003). The highest depression, anxiety and stress levels of healthcare employees come from the pandemic, emergency, and internal services (p < 0.001).

496,"Remote-learning, time-use, and mental health of Ecuadorian high-school students during the COVID-19 quarantine","The COVID-19 pandemic has closed schools around the world, forcing school systems and students to quickly attempt remote learning. We conducted a rapid response phone survey of over 1500 high school students aged 14 to 18 in Ecuador to learn how students spend their time during the period of quarantine, examine their access to remote learning, and measure their mental health status.

498,Music as a factor associated with emotional self-regulation: A study on its relationship to age during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain,"The purpose of this research is to reveal the possible relational influence of age on frequency and form of music consumption, its use, and value as a factor associated with emotional self-regulation in pandemic contexts. With this objective, this study applied a transversal, descriptive and analytical design in a sample of 1377 Spaniards during the confinement of COVID-19 from March 14 to June 20, 2020. The results report that music has been an essential generalized support for living with isolation and a powerful instrument for emotional self-regulation and relief from loneliness. Although an increase of 56% in the daily use of music for self-regulation of emotions was detected, higher frequencies of consumption, mainly in solitude, and a better conception of this artistic expression are identified in the population over 51 years old. However, young people between 18 and 40 years old stood out in the use of music as a resource to alleviate loneliness. These results confirm that music seems to have arisen as one of the most used artistic expressions to cope with loneliness, to relate to the outside or as a tool to endure psychological and emotional states catalogued as negative such as anxiety, anguish and depression, among others. Likewise, they evidence its role in personal and social wellbeing in distant age ranges, and the relational influence of music and age in contexts of isolation and loneliness.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06274,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06274,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06274,2021-02-01,,,

Nous présentons les adaptations d’un programme de thérapie comportementale dialectique et les conséquences du confinement sur le vécu de patients souffrant d’un trouble de personnalité borderline. Méthode Nous avons, pour sept patients, comparé deux périodes de huit semaines, avant et pendant le confinement. Nous avons analysé leurs cartes journalières (n =426) et le recensement hebdomadaire de la fréquence de leurs comportements problèmes (n =69). Résultats L’analyse des cartes journalières indique que la période de confinement prédit une diminution significative des sentiments de peur, de honte ou culpabilité et de tension mais une augmentation de la détresse. Le suivi hebdomadaire montre une diminution significative des comportements hyperphagiques. Discussion Malgré le petit nombre de patients inclus, cette étude se base sur des échantillonnages d’expérience au quotidien et des mesures hebdomadaires. Ces deux types de mesures répétées indiquent certaines améliorations pendant le confinement, attestant des capacités d’adaptation de ces patients, soutenus par un cadre thérapeutique intensif qui a été maintenu. Background The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement. Method We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (n =426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n =69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations. Results The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7 %) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m=30.9 [10.0]) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m=15.0 [5.0]). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement. Conclusions Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,2021-02-01,,,
506,The burden of loneliness: Implications of the social determinants of health during COVID-19,"This study sought to examine if mental health issues, namely depression and anxiety symptoms, and loneliness were experienced differently according to various demographic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., a societal stressor). An online survey, comprising demographic questions and questionnaires on depression, anxiety and loneliness symptoms, was distributed in Canada during the height of social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents (N=661) from lower income households experienced greater anxiety, depression and loneliness. Specifically, loneliness was greater in those with an annual income <$50,000/yr versus higher income brackets. Younger females (18-29yr) displayed greater anxiety, depressive symptoms and loneliness than their male counterparts; this difference did not exist among the other age groups (30-64yr, >65yr). Moreover, loneliness scores increased with increasing depression and anxiety symptom severity category. The relationship between loneliness and depression symptoms was moderated by gender, such that females experienced higher depressive symptoms when encountering greater loneliness. These data identify younger females, individuals with lower income, and those living alone as experiencing greater loneliness and mental health challenges during the height of the pandemic in Canada. We highlight the strong relationship between loneliness, depression and anxiety, and emphasize increased vulnerability among certain cohorts.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113648,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113648,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113648,2021-02-01,,,

508,"Investigating changes in noise pollution due to the COVID-19 lockdown: The case of Dublin, Ireland","Noise pollution is considered to be the third most hazardous pollution after air and water pollution by the World Health Organization (WHO). Short as well as long-term exposure to noise pollution has several adverse effects on humans, ranging from psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression, hypertension, hormonal dysfunction, and blood pressure rise leading to cardiovascular disease. One of the major sources of noise pollution is road traffic and the WHO reports that around 40 % of Europe’s population are currently exposed to high noise/sound levels. This study investigates sound levels in Dublin, Ireland before and after the lockdown imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis was performed using measured hourly data from 12 noise monitoring stations between January and May, 2020. More than 80 % of the stations recorded high sound levels for more that 60 % of the time before the lockdown in Dublin. However, a significant reduction in hourly average equivalent sound and hourly minimum sound levels was observed at all stations during the lockdown period and this can be attributed to reductions in both road and air traffic movements.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102597,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102597,Scopus,10.1016/j.scs.2020.102597,2021-02-01,,,
509,Smartphone Screen Time: Inaccuracy of self-reports and influence of psychological and contextual factors,"Previous research investigating associations between screen time and various undesirable consequences (e.g., poor mental health) has relied heavily on self-report measures. However, there is debate regarding whether self-reports overestimate or underestimate actual screen time. We used advances in iPhone software to address this question and to investigate the influence of individual difference factors, and COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, on screen time. Participants (N = 267, 18–25 years) completed scales measuring depression, anxiety, smartphone attachment, and estimated their screen time. Thereafter, they shared screenshots of their battery use (BUS) and iPhone screen time (iOS STT) data. Some (n = 24) shared their BUS data again during the COVID-19 lockdown. Whereas the BUS data (10-day average, including two weekends) indicated that self-reports underestimated actual use, the iOS STT data (7-day average) indicated that self-reports overestimated actual use (ps < .007). Smartphone use was heavier over weekends and screen time increased significantly during the lockdown (p = .001). Finally, smartphone attachment mediated the relationship between objective screen time and depression, but not anxiety. We conclude that iPhone tracking features can reliably collect objective screen time data, and that screen time is significantly influenced by both individual difference factors and environmental context.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106616,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106616,Scopus,10.1016/j.chb.2020.106616,2021-02-01,,,

511,Trajectories of anxiety and depressive symptoms during enforced isolation due to COVID-19 in England: a longitudinal observational study,"Background There is major concern about the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak on mental health. Several studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries before and during enforced isolation (ie, lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed week by week over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the trajectories of anxiety and depression over the 20 weeks after lockdown was announced in England, and compare the growth trajectories by individual characteristics. Methods In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we analysed data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a panel study weighted to population proportions, which collects information on anxiety (using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment) and depressive symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire) weekly in the UK since March 21, 2020. We included data from adults living in England who had at least three repeated measures between March 23 and Aug 9, 2020. Analyses were done using latent growth models, which were fitted to account for sociodemographic and health covariates. Findings Between March 23, and Aug 9, data from over 70 000 adults were collected in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. When including participants living in England with three follow-up measures and no missing values, our analytic sample consisted of 36 520 participants. The average depression score was 6·6 (SD=6·0, range 0–27) and the average anxiety score 5·7 (SD=5·6, range 0–21) in week 1. Anxiety and depression levels both declined across the first 20 weeks following the introduction of lockdown in England (b=–1·93, SE=0·26, p<0·0001 for anxiety; b=–2·52, SE=0·28, p<0·0001 for depressive symptoms). The fastest decreases were seen across the strict lockdown period (between weeks 2 and 5), with symptoms plateauing as further lockdown easing measures were introduced (between weeks 16 and 20). Being a woman or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income, or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depression at the start of lockdown. Many of these inequalities in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued, but differences were still evident 20 weeks after the start of lockdown. Interpretation These data suggest that the highest levels of depression and anxiety occurred in the early stages of lockdown but declined fairly rapidly, possibly because individuals adapted to circumstances. Our findings emphasise the importance of supporting individuals in the lead-up to future lockdowns to try to reduce distress, and highlight that groups already at risk for poor mental health before the pandemic have remained at risk throughout lockdown and its aftermath.

512,The immediate psychological response of the general population in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study,"Background The outbreak of COVID-19 may differentially exacerbate anxiety and stress in people subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Method An online cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the general population’s psychological response during the initial state of the outbreak in Saudi Arabia. The study used brief screening tools PHQ-4 for anxiety-depression symptoms and IES-6 for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Results Among the 584 respondents, 19.8% and 22.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms respectively. According to the combined PHQ-4 score, 14.5% of participants showed moderate to severe anxiety or depression disorder. Overall, 64.8% met the level of clinical concern for posttraumatic stress disorder and 51.3% met the level of probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Multivariate analyses showed that females, non-Saudi nationalities, and those who had a history of mental illness were more vulnerable to anxiety and depression disorders than their counterparts, whereas a higher prevalence of distress symptoms was reported among those who prefer Arabic over English for communication. It was found that people whose colleagues or family infected with the disease were more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression and distress. The study further showed that the higher the perceived threat, the higher the chances of exhibiting anxiety-depressive disorder symptoms and distress symptoms. Conclusion The findings might be a matter for serious concern, and considerable attention is required from authorities and policymakers regarding early detection and treatment of these illnesses in order to reduce the burden of the pandemic related mental illness.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.11.017,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.11.017,Scopus,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.11.017,2021-02-01,,,

517,Alcohol use and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study in a sample of UK adults,"Background The aim was to examine the correlates of increased alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions that were implemented in a sample of UK adults. Methods This paper presents analyses of data from a cross-sectional study. Adults aged 18 years and over, residing in the UK and self-isolating from others outside their own household were eligible to participate. Participants reported increase or no increase in their level of alcohol consumption from before to during lockdown, as well as symptoms of anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing. Socio-demographic characteristics were compared between adults with and without reported increased alcohol consumption. The associations between reported increased alcohol consumption and mental health outcomes were investigated using logistic and linear regression analyses. Results 691 adults (61.1 % women; 48.8 % aged 35−64 years) were included in the analysis. Of these, 17 % reported increased alcohol consumption after lockdown. A higher proportion of 18−34-year olds reported increased alcohol consumption compared to older groups. The prevalence of poor overall mental health was significantly higher in individuals with increased alcohol consumption (vs. no increase) (45.4 % versus 32.7 %; p-value = 0.01). There was a significant association between increased alcohol consumption and poor overall mental health (OR = 1.64; 95 % CI = 1.01, 2.66), depressive symptoms (unstandardized beta = 2.93; 95 % CI = 0.91, 4.95) and mental wellbeing (unstandardized beta=-1.38; 95 % CI=-2.38, -0.39). Conclusions More than one in six UK adults increased their alcohol consumption during lockdown and a higher proportion of these were younger adults. Increased alcohol consumption was independently associated with poor overall mental health, increased depressive symptoms and lower mental wellbeing.

569,6-month consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital: a cohort study,"Background The long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity. Methods We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5–6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences. Findings In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 57·0 (IQR 47·0–65·0) years and 897 (52%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 186·0 (175·0–199·0) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24% for those at severity scale 3, 22% for severity scale 4, and 29% for severity scale 5–6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22% for severity scale 3, 29% for scale 4, and 56% for scale 5–6, and median CT scores were 3·0 (IQR 2·0–5·0) for severity scale 3, 4·0 (3·0–5·0) for scale 4, and 5·0 (4·0–6·0) for scale 5–6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 1·61 (95% CI 0·80–3·25) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 4·60 (1·85–11·48) for scale 5–6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 0·88 (0·66–1·17) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 1·77 (1·05–2·97) for scale 5–6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 0·74 (0·58–0·96) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 2·69 (1·46–4·96) for scale 5–6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (96·2% vs 58·5%) and median titres (19·0 vs 10·0) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 1·73 m2 or more at acute phase had eGFR less than 90 mL/min per 1·73 m2 at follow-up. Interpretation At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.

570,"Self-reported changes in anxiety, depression and suicidality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","Introduction There are only a few published empirical data on COVID‐19′s effects on the mental health. Material and Methods During lockdown, an online questionnaire registered demographic, health data, previous psychiatric history, current anxiety, depression and suicidality, believing in conspiracy theories and other domains. Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02 ± 9.72 and 18.27% males; aged 36.38±10.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. Statistical Analysis A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. Results Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. Conclusions The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since most of these factors are modifiable. Future research, as well as interventions, should focus specifically on them.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.061,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.061,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.061,2021-01-15,,,

573,The COVID-19 pandemic and serious psychological consequences in Bangladesh: A population-based nationwide study,"Background As with other countries worldwide, lockdown measures during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh were sudden and unexpected, and have the capacity to elicit serious psychological consequences. The present study examined the psychological consequences of COVID-19 in Bangladesh during the lockdown period. Methods A nationwide online cross-sectional survey study recruited 10,067 individuals covering all 64 districts in Bangladesh via social media (April 1-10, 2020). The survey comprised questions concerning socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behavior towards COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation. Logistic regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were performed to identify the risk factors depression and suicidal ideation. Geographical information system (GIS)-based spatial analysis was used to identify district-wise susceptibility to depression and suicidal ideation. Findings The prevalence rate of depression and suicidal ideation related to COVID-19 was 33% and 5%%. Common risk factors for suicidal ideation and depression included being young, being female, being a cigarette smoker, having comorbid diseases, having high scores on the Fear COVID-19 Scale, and having insomnia symptoms. GIS-based maps detected high depression and suicidal ideation in the capital of Bangladesh and the districts near the capital as well as coastal areas where COVID-19 prevalence was high, as compared with districts with no reported cases. Limitations Self-reported scales and cross-sectional design of the study. Conclusion COVID-19 is associated with major psychological impact across Bangladesh, underlining the need of strategically located psychological support measures and improved access to mental health services, especially among women and younger people.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.036,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.036,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.036,2021-01-15,,,
574,"Modelling the contribution of the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress to generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","In the current study we sought to extend our understanding of vulnerability and protective factors (the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress) in predicting generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (n = 502), who were United States residents, completed a variety of sociodemographic questions and the following questionnaires: Big Five Inventory‐10 (BFI-10), Whitley Index 7 (WI-7), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C19-ASS), and Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness were negatively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms and that neuroticism, health anxiety and both measures of COVID-19 psychological distress were positively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. We used path analysis to determine the pattern of relationships specified by the theoretical model we proposed. Results showed that health anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome partially mediated the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were negatively associated with the three mediators, which, in turn, were positively associated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms, with COVID-19 anxiety showing the strongest effect. Conversely, neuroticism and openness were positively associated with COVID-19 anxiety and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, respectively. These relationships were independent of age, gender, employment status and risk status. The model accounted for a substantial variance of generalised anxiety and depression symptoms (R2 = .75).

Methods A cross-sectional online survey of 4-342 primary and secondary school students from Shanghai, China was conducted during March 13–23, 2020. Besides demographic information, psychological distress (including depression, anxiety, and stress), life satisfaction, perceived impact of home quarantine, and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were assessed. Results The three most prevalent symptoms were: anxiety (24.9%), depression (19.7%), and stress (15.2%). Participants were generally satisfied with life and 21.4% became more satisfied with life during school closures. Senior grades were positively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and negatively associated with life satisfaction, whereas the perceived benefit from home quarantine and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were negatively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and positively correlated with life satisfaction. Among participants who perceived no benefit from home quarantine, those who had discussions with their parents about COVID-19 experienced less depression, anxiety, and stress. Limitations Limitations included the inability to infer the casual relationship, no parental report for mental health of children aged 6 to 9, and the inadequate measurement of parent-child discussion. Conclusions Mental health problems and resilience co-existed in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the important role of parent-child discussions, open communication between parents and children about the pandemic should be encouraged to help children and adolescents cope with mental health problems in public health crisis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.016,2021-01-15,,,
576,Neuropsychological and neurophysiological correlates of fatigue in post-acute patients with neurological manifestations of COVID-19: Insights into a challenging symptom,"More than half of patients who recover from COVID-19 experience fatigue. We studied fatigue using neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations in post-COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. Neuropsychological assessment included: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale, cognitive tests, and computerized tasks. Neurophysiological examination was assessed before (PRE) and 2 min after (POST) a 1-min fatiguing isometric pinching task and included: maximum compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) following ulnar nerve stimulation, resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and silent period (SP) duration in right FDI following transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex. Maximum pinch strength was measured. Perceived exertion was assessed with the Borg-Category-Ratio scale. Patients manifested fatigue, apathy, executive deficits, impaired cognitive control, and reduction in global cognition. Perceived exertion was higher in patients. CMAP and MEP were smaller in patients both PRE and POST. CMAP did not change in either group from PRE to POST, while MEP amplitudes declined in controls POST. SP duration did not differ between groups PRE, increased in controls but decreased in patients POST. Patients' change of SP duration from PRE to POST was negatively correlated to FSS. Abnormal SP shortening and lack of MEP depression concur with a reduction in post-exhaustion corticomotor inhibition, suggesting a possible GABAB-ergic dysfunction. This impairment might be related to the neuropsychological alterations. COVID-19-associated inflammation might lead to GABAergic impairment, possibly representing the basis of fatigue and explaining apathy and executive deficits.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117271,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117271,Scopus,10.1016/j.jns.2020.117271,2021-01-15,,,

Method This review was conducted based on papers that were published at MEDLINE, BMJ, PsycINFO, and LILACS, the according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA). Results Health professionals had a higher level of anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01, OR = 1.6152; 95%CI 1.3283 to 1.9641; p < 0.0001) and depression 12.2 vs. 9.5%; p = 0.04; OR = 1.3246; 95%CI 1.0930 to 1.6053; p = 0.0042), besides somatizations and insomnia compared to professionals from other areas. Conclusion Health professionals, regardless of their age, showed significant levels of mental disorders. We observed a prevalence of anxiety and depression.

594,"Psychiatric symptomatology associated with depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia in health professionals working in patients affected by COVID-19: A systematic review with meta-analysis","Background Health professionals are key personnel to containing infectious diseases like COVID-19. In the face of long work shifts (that reach 16 h per day on average), the risk of getting infected by a high-infectious disease and the lack of enough biological protection measures, mental suffering among health professionals suddenly became evident. Method We carried out an updated meta-analysis to investigate the psychiatric impacts on health professionals in the face of the physical and psychological conditions to which they are subjected due to the high demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Papers were researched in four databases from December 2019 to April 2020. In total, eight papers were included in the study. Results Health professionals working to fight COVID-19 are being more severely affected by psychiatric disorders associated with depression, anxiety, distress and insomnia, stress, and indirect traumatization than other occupational groups. No significant differences were observed in the publication bias. Conclusion There is a strong association between health professionals and COVID-19 in terms of psychiatric repercussions. Our meta-analysis showed that health professionals have a higher level of indirect traumatization, in which the level of damage exceeds psychological and emotional tolerance and indirectly results in psychological abnormalities. The incidence of obsessive-compulsive traces and somatizations was higher in situations involving front-line professionals.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057,Scopus,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057,2021-01-10,,,

633,Associations between periods of COVID-19 quarantine and mental health in Canada,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, including Canada, have made use of public health measures such as COVID-19 quarantine to reduce the transmission of the virus. To examine associations between these periods of quarantine and mental health, including suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm, we examined data from a national survey of 3000 Canadian adults distributed between May 14-29, 2020. Notably, participants provided the reason(s) for quarantine. When pooling all reasons for quarantine together, this experience was associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm in the two weeks preceding the survey. These associations remained even after controlling for age, household income, having a pre-existing mental health condition, being unemployed due to the pandemic, and living alone. However, the associations with mental health differed across reasons for quarantine; those who were self-isolating specifically due to recent travel were not found to have higher odds of suicidal ideation or deliberate self-harm. Our research suggests the importance of accounting for the reason(s) for quarantine in the implementation of this critical public health measure to reduce the mental health impacts of this experience.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113631,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113631,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113631,2021-01-01,,,

637,CCopeY: A Mixed-Methods Coproduced Study on the Mental Health Status and Coping Strategies of Young People During COVID-19 UK Lockdown,"Purpose Exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people’s mental health is an increasing priority. Studies to date are largely surveys and lack meaningful involvement from service users in their design, planning, and delivery. The study aimed to examine the mental health status and coping strategies of young people during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown using coproduction methodology. Methods The mental health status of young people (aged 16–24) in April 2020 was established utilizing a sequential explanatory coproduced mixed methods design. Factors associated with poor mental health status, including coping strategies, were also examined using an online survey and semi-structured interviews. Results Since the lockdown, 30.3% had poor mental health, and 10.8% had self-harmed. Young people identifying as Black/Black-British ethnicity had the highest increased odds of experiencing poor mental health (odds ratio [OR] 3.688, 95% CI .54–25.40). Behavioral disengagement (OR 1.462, 95% CI 1.22–1.76), self-blame (OR 1.307 95% CI 1.10–1.55), and substance use (OR 1.211 95% CI 1.02–1.44) coping strategies, negative affect (OR 1.109, 95% CI 1.07–1.15), sleep problems (OR .915 95% CI .88–.95) and conscientiousness personality trait (OR .819 95% CI .69–.98) were significantly associated with poor mental health. Three qualitative themes were identified: (1) pre-existing/developed helpful coping strategies employed, (2) mental health difficulties worsened, and (3) mental health and nonmental health support needed during and after lockdown. Conclusion Poor mental health is associated with dysfunctional coping strategies. Innovative coping strategies can help other young people cope during and after lockdowns, with digital and school promotion and application.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.009,2021-01-01,,,

643,Changes in pediatric trauma during COVID-19 stay-at-home epoch at a tertiary pediatric hospital,"Background Trauma is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. However, during the societal disruptions secondary to the coronavirus (COVID-19) stay-at-home regulations, there have been reported changes to the pattern and severity of pediatric trauma. We review our two-institution experience. Methods Pediatric trauma emergency department (ED) encounters from the National Trauma Registry for a large, tertiary, metropolitan level 1 pediatric trauma center and pediatric burn admission at the regional burn center were extracted for children less than 19 years from March 15th thru May 15th during the years 2015–2020. The primary outcome was the difference in encounters during the COVID-19 (2020) epoch versus the pre-COVID-19 epoch (2015–2019). Results There were 392 pediatric trauma encounters during the COVID-19 epoch as compared to 451, 475, 520, 460, 432 (mean 467.6) during the pre-COVID-19 epoch. Overall trauma admissions and ED trauma encounters were significantly lower (p < 0.001) during COVID-19. Burn injury admissions (p < 0.001) and penetrating trauma encounters (p = 0.002) increased during the COVID-19 epoch while blunt trauma encounters decreased (p < 0.001). Trauma occurred among more white (p = 0.01) and privately insured (p < 0.001) children, but no difference in suspected abuse, injury severity, mortality, age, or gender were detected. Sub-analysis showed significant decreases in motor vehicle crashes (p < 0.001), pedestrians struck by automobile (p < 0.001), all-terrain vehicle (ATV)/motorcross/bicycle/skateboard involved injuries (p = 0.02), falls (p < 0.001), and sports related injuries (p < 0.001). Fewer injuries occurring in the playground or home play equipment such as trampolines neared significance (p = 0.05). Interpersonal violence (assault, NAT, self-harm) was lower during the COVID-19 era (p = 0.04). For burn admissions, there was a significant increase in flame burns (p < 0.001). Conclusions Stay-at-home regulations alter societal patterns, leading to decreased overall and blunt traumas. However, the proportion of penetrating and burn injuries increased. Owing to increased stressors and time spent at home, healthcare professionals should keep a high suspicion for abuse and neglect.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2021.01.020,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2021.01.020,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2021.01.020,2021-01-01,,,
644,The global burden of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review,"Purpose; The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated profound adaptations in the delivery of healthcare to manage a rise in critically unwell patients. In an attempt to slow the spread of the virus nationwide lockdown restrictions were introduced. This review aims to scope the literature on the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on the presentation and management of trauma globally. Methods; A scoping review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A systematic search was carried out on the Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases to identify papers investigating presentation and management of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. All studies based on patients admitted with orthopaedic trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Exclusion criteria were opinion-based reports, reviews, studies that did not provide quantitative data and papers not in English. Results; 665 studies were screened, with 57 meeting the eligibility criteria. Studies reported on the footfall of trauma in the UK, Europe, Asia, USA, Australia and New Zealand. A total of 29,591 patients during the pandemic were considered. Mean age was 43.7 years (range <1–103); 54.8% were male. Reported reductions in trauma footfall ranged from 20.3% to 84.6%, with a higher proportion of trauma occurring secondary to interpersonal violence, deliberate self-harm and falls from a height. A decrease was seen in road traffic collisions, sports injuries and trauma occurring outdoors. There was no significant change in the proportion of patients managed operatively, and the number of trauma patients reported to be COVID-19 positive was low. Conclusion; Whilst the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in the number of trauma patients; the services managing trauma have continued to function despite infrastructural, personnel and pathway changes in health systems. The substantial effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on elective orthopaedics is well described, however the contents of this review evidence minimal change in the delivery of effective trauma care despite resource constraints during this global COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.11.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.11.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcot.2020.11.005,2021-01-01,,,

648,‘The dual pandemic’ of suicide and COVID-19: A biopsychosocial narrative of risks and prevention,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a new global health threat. By increasing the risk of isolation, fear, stigma, abuse and economic fallout, COVID-19 has led to increase in risk of psychiatric disorders, chronic trauma and stress, which eventually increase suicidality and suicidal behavior. There is limited data on association of pandemics and suicides. Cases of suicides have been rising since COVID-19 first emerged in China. The association between suicides and pandemics can possibly be explained through various models like Durkheim's theory, Joiner's interpersonal theory, social stress theory, biological theories, etc. The frontline workers, elderly, migrants, homeless, socio-economically impoverished classes as well as those with pre-existing mental disorders, substance abuse and family history of suicides are at higher risk. Suicides are preventable and need early detection, awareness and socio-culturally tailored interventions. This narrative review draws global perspectives on the association of suicidality and pandemics, the theories and risk factors related to same based on the available evidence. It also hypothesizes neuroimmunity and immune based risk factors as possible links between the psychosocial vulnerabilities and suicide during outbreaks like COVID-19. Proposed strategies of suicide-prevention, as an integral part of public health response to the pandemic are subsequently discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113577,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113577,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113577,2021-01-01,,,

The current study aims to examine the delivery of brief cognitive-behavioral therapy for suicide prevention (BCBT-SP) via Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT) to the home of a veteran discharged from the psychiatric inpatient unit after a recent suicide attempt. Preliminary data on acceptability, feasibility, and changes in symptoms were gathered. The veteran received treatment during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak and additional adaptations were made accordingly. The veteran did not engage in any suicidal behavior during the course of treatment, and suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety decreased as treatment progressed.

701,"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on critical care healthcare workers' depression, anxiety, and stress levels","Aim The aim of the study was to determine levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and factors associated with psychological burden amongst critical care healthcare workers in the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods An anonymous Web-based survey distributed in April 2020. All healthcare workers employed in a critical care setting were eligible to participate. Invitations to the survey were distributed through Australian and New Zealand critical care societies and social media platforms. The primary outcome was the proportion of healthcare workers who reported moderate to extremely severe scores on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results Of the 3770 complete responses, 3039 (80.6%) were from Australia. A total of 2871 respondents (76.2%) were women; the median age was 41 years. Nurses made up 2269 (60.2%) of respondents, with most (2029 [53.8%]) working in intensive care units. Overall, 813 (21.6%) respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, 1078 (28.6%) reported moderate to extremely severe anxiety, and 1057 (28.0%) reported moderate to extremely severe stress scores. Mean ± standard deviation values of DASS-21 depression, anxiety, and stress scores amongst woman vs men was as follows: 8.0 ± 8.2 vs 7.1 ± 8.2 (p = 0.003), 7.2 ± 7.5 vs 5.0 ± 6.7 (p < 0.001), and 14.4 ± 9.6 vs 12.5 ± 9.4 (p < 0.001), respectively. After adjusting for significant confounders, clinical concerns associated with higher DASS-21 scores included not being clinically prepared (β = 4.2, p < 0.001), an inadequate workforce (β = 2.4, p = 0.001), having to triage patients owing to lack of beds and/or equipment (β = 2.6, p = 0.001), virus transmission to friends and family (β = 2.1, p = 0.009), contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (β = 2.8, p = 0.011), being responsible for other staff members (β = 3.1, p < 0.001), and being asked to work in an area that was not in the respondents' expertise (β = 5.7, p < 0.001). Conclusion In this survey of critical care healthcare workers, between 22 and 29% of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, with women reporting higher scores than men. Although female gender appears to play a role, modifiable factors also contribute to psychological burden and should be studied further.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.12.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.12.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.aucc.2020.12.004,2021-01-01,,,

While necessary, physical distancing interventions to control the spread of COVID-19 could have multiple impacts on people living with opioid use disorder, including impacts on mental health that lead to greater substance use, the availability of drug supply, the ways that people use drugs, treatment-seeking behaviors, and retention in care.

709,The plausible mechanisms of tramadol for treatment of COVID-19,"Currently, no single medication has been approved for the management of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, drug repositioningby investigating the use of existing drugs for management of COVID-19 patients is considered a desperate need. Tramadol is a commonly prescribed analgesic drug for treatment of moderate to severe pain with less potential for dependence and respiratory depression. Multiple evidence support that tramadol is a promising drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Herein, we discuss the possible beneficial effects of using tramadol against SARS-CoV-2 infection and their underlying mechanism of action. The anti-inflammatory effect of tramadol may help to suppress the COVID-19 related cytokine storm through decreasing interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Besides, tramadol activates natural killer (NK) and T-cells and enhances IL-2 secretion, which produce immune-enhancing effect against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies confirmed that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure showed increased fibrin formation and polymerization that may lead to thrombosis. Tramadol owing to its hypocoagulable effect may protect against venous thromboembolism in these patients. Moreover, tramadol can exert a cardioprotective effect via decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level which is elevated in most of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have been correlated with old age patients, which may be due to the lack of antioxidant mechanisms and increased oxidative damage. Tramadol could protect COVID-19 patient from disease complications by increases the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase while diminished malondialdehyde. More interestingly, tramadol as an effective analgesic and antitussive may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19 patients suffering from cough, headache, ache, and pain. The tramadol anti-psychotic effect may also protect against psychiatric disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, tramadol has bactericidal activity against a wide range of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is common in severe COVID-19 patients leading to pneumonia with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesize that tramadol might be a promising adjuvant therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on that, tramadol should be considered as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 clinical trials.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110468,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110468,Scopus,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110468,2021-01-01,,,

711,"The three frontlines against COVID-19: Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raising global anxiety and fear of both real and perceived health threat from the virus. Overwhelming evidence shows infected patients experiencing neuropsychiatric complications, suggesting that the “psychoneuroimmunity” model might be beneficial in understanding the impact of the virus. Therefore, this Special Issue on “Immunopsychiatry of COVID-19 Pandemic” was launched immediately after the pandemic was declared, with the first paper accepted on the March 25th, 2020. A total of ninety-three papers were accepted, the last one was on the July 10th, 2020 when the initial acute phase started declining. The papers of this Special Issue have illuminated the social impact, psychopathology, neurological manifestation, immunity responses, and potential treatments and prevention on COVID-19. For example, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and suicidal ideation are most common psychiatric manifestations. COVID-19 infection can have central and/or peripheral nervous system symptoms, including headache, sleep disorders, encephalopathy, and loss of taste and smell. A “three-steps” Neuro-COVID infection model (neuro-invasion, clearance and immune response) was established. The current therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 include supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and plasma transfusion.

716,How are bariatric patients coping during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic? Analysis of factors known to cause weight regain among postoperative bariatric patients,"Background The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is wreaking havoc on society. Bariatric patients are more prone to severe infection due to their high body mass index (BMI) and are more vulnerable to the effects of isolation, such as depression or disruption of their health habits. Objectives To quantify the impact of self-quarantine on bariatric patients and self-quarantine’s relationship with weight gain. Setting Academic hospital, United States. Methods A 30-item survey examining several known contributors to weight regain was distributed among the postoperative bariatric patients of our clinic. Changes in eating habits, exercise, depression, social support, loneliness, and anxiety were studied, among others. Results A total of 208 patients completed the survey (29.3% response rate). A large percentage of patients reported increases in their depression (44.2%), loneliness (36.2%), nervousness (54.7%), snacking (62.6%), loss of control when eating (48.2%), and binge eating (19.5%) and decreases in their social support (23.2%), healthy food eating (45.5%), and activity (55.2%). Difficulty in accessing vitamins was reported by 13%. Patients more than 18 months out of surgery regained more than 2 kg during an average of 47 days. Risk factors for weight regain were found to be loss of control when eating, increases in snacking and binge eating, reduced consumption of healthy food, and reduced physical activity. Conclusion Bariatric patients are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social isolation on many levels. This patient population is vulnerable to crisis situations; thus, additional intervention is needed to address behaviors that lead to weight regain.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2020.11.021,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2020.11.021,Scopus,10.1016/j.soard.2020.11.021,2021-01-01,,,

Methods This longitudinal study was based on a telephone follow-up survey of COVID-19 patients hospitalized and discharged from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China before 1 March 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported clinical sequelae of the survivors were described and analysed. A cohort of volunteers who were free of COVID-19 and lived in the urban area of Wuhan during the outbreak were also selected as the comparison group. Results Among 538 survivors (293, 54.5% female), the median (interquartile range) age was 52.0 (41.0–62.0) years, and the time from discharge from hospital to first follow-up was 97.0 (95.0–102.0) days. Clinical sequelae were common, including general symptoms (n = 267, 49.6%), respiratory symptoms (n = 210, 39%), cardiovascular-related symptoms (n = 70, 13%), psychosocial symptoms (n = 122, 22.7%) and alopecia (n = 154, 28.6%). We found that physical decline/fatigue (p < 0.01), postactivity polypnoea (p= 0.04) and alopecia (p < 0.01) were more common in female than in male subjects. Dyspnoea during hospitalization was associated with subsequent physical decline/fatigue, postactivity polypnoea and resting heart rate increases but not specifically with alopecia. A history of asthma during hospitalization was associated with subsequent postactivity polypnoea sequela. A history of pulse ≥90 bpm during hospitalization was associated with resting heart rate increase in convalescence. The duration of virus shedding after COVID-19 onset and hospital length of stay were longer in survivors with physical decline/fatigue or postactivity polypnoea than in those without. Conclusions Clinical sequelae during early COVID-19 convalescence were common; some of these sequelae might be related to gender, age and clinical characteristics during hospitalization.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.09.023,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.09.023,Scopus,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.09.023,2021-01-01,,,
733,Obsessive-compulsive disorder during COVID-19: Turning a problem into an opportunity?,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted global measures to prevent infection. Experts assume that it is particularly affecting people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), especially those with washing compulsions. Data, however, are currently lacking. 394 participants with OCD (n = 223 washers) participated in an online survey. Change in severity of OCD symptoms, reasons participants reported for the change (e.g., reduced mobility, reduced availability of cleaning products, economic factors, interpersonal conflicts), as well as participants’ beliefs and experience associated with COVID-19 were assessed. 72 % of the participants reported an increase in OCD. This increase was significantly stronger in washers compared to non-washers. The worsening of symptoms was primarily associated with reduced mobility and interpersonal conflicts. Dysfunctional hygiene-related beliefs were significantly higher in washers than non-washers and were associated with greater symptom progression. Washers were more confident than non-washers about providing other people with helpful advice related to infection preventions. Washers, however, received more negative feedback from others in response to the advice they provided than non-washers. The majority of participants with OCD were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative effects were more pronounced in washers than in non-washers.

735,"Examine the associations between perceived neighborhood conditions, physical activity, and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined how neighborhood conditions changed and how neighborhood conditions were associated with physical activity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans. The major outcomes were stratified by the neighborhood's poverty and regression models were used to assess the associations between neighborhood conditions and their change during the pandemic and the outcomes of physical activity and mental health. The results show that low-poverty neighborhoods had more health-promoting neighborhood conditions before the outbreak and more positive changes during the outbreak. Health-promoting neighborhood conditions were associated with higher physical activity and moderate physical activity and lack of negative neighborhood conditions such as crime/violence and traffic were associated with a lower risk of mental health problems including loneliness, depression, and anxiety. Mental health problems were also significantly associated with the COVID-19 infection and death and household income level. Our findings suggest that it is plausible that the disparities of physical activity and mental health by neighborhood exacerbate due to the pandemic and people who living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods bear increasingly disproportionate burden.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102505,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102505,Scopus,10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102505,2021-01-01,,,

739,"Coronavirus 2019 Infectious Disease Epidemic: Where We Are, What Can Be Done and Hope For","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads mainly by means of aerosols (microdroplets) in enclosed environments, especially those in which temperature and humidity are regulated by means of air-conditioning. About 30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Among them, approximately 25% require hospitalization. In medicine, cases are identified as those who become ill. During this pandemic, cases have been identified as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, including approximately 70% who were asymptomatic—this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals more than 65 years old, those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, or are immune-depressed owing to cancer and other conditions, are at a higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 years very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality rate vary because the definition of COVID-19–related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death rate at 154.9 per 100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2. The United States includes all patients who died with a positive test, whether they died because of, or with, SARS-CoV-2. Countries that include only patients in which COVID-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a cofactor, have lower death rates. Numerous therapies are being developed, and rapid improvements are anticipated. Because of disinformation, only approximately 50% of the U.S. population plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. By sharing accurate information, physicians, health professionals, and scientists play a key role in addressing myths and anxiety, help public health officials enact measures to decrease infections, and provide the best care for those who become sick.

The awareness rates about COVID-19 were 70.1%–99.5% for all 1650 valid questionnaires. 37.2% of the participants quite worried about being infected with COVID-19. Approximately 96% of them washed hands in certain situations, while 85.6% of them washed hands after coughing or sneezing. Compared to the students without depressive symptoms, those who had depressive symptoms scored lower of total KAP, knowledge, attitudes, and practice.

Methods Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 age, sex, body mass index comorbidity-matched controls were enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments. Findings At 2–3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced breathlessness and 55% reported fatigue. On MRI, abnormalities were seen in lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%). Patients exhibited changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domains. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance were significantly reduced. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise intolerance correlated with serum markers of inflammation and acute illness severity. Patients had a higher burden of self-reported symptoms of depression and experienced significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls (p<0.0001 to 0.044). Interpretation A significant proportion of patients discharged from hospital reported symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, depression and had limited exercise capacity. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common in patients and linked to inflammation and severity of acute illness.

761,"The association between depression symptoms, psychological burden caused by Covid-19 and physical activity: An investigation in Germany, Italy, Russia, and Spain","The outbreak of Covid-19 required the re-organization of everyday life. While some people accepted this challenge, other experienced the current situation as a heavy burden that impedes the adaptation to the new life conditions. The present study investigated factors that can impact the level of burden caused by Covid-19. Burden, depression symptoms and frequency of physical activity (e.g., jogging, cycling) were assessed via online surveys in overall 1,931 people from four countries (Germany: N = 625; Italy: N = 936; Russia: N = 230; Spain: N = 140). Similar result patterns were found in all country-specific samples. Burden by Covid-19 was significantly positively associated with depression symptoms, while it was significantly negatively linked to physical activity. Moreover, physical activity buffered the association between depression symptoms and burden. The present cross-national findings emphasize the protective effect of physical activity specifically in times of Covid-19. This issue should be addressed in governmental programs to longitudinally protect mental and physical health and to enhance the willingness to adhere to the anti-Covid-19 measures among the population.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113596,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113596,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113596,2021-01-01,,,

765,Nexus planning as a pathway towards sustainable environmental and human health post Covid-19,"The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of linear and monocentric approaches in addressing today's complex, cross-cutting, and interconnected challenges. Experiences from the Covid-19 have shown that focusing on one sector during a crisis only aggravates the stresses in other sectors as decision-makers often view the world from a linear perspective, with the thought that a click of a button would get the economy and society back on track. This study argues that linearity forgets the interconnectedness of systems and how their systemic properties shape their interactions, interdependencies, and interrelationships, whereas nexus planning integrates and simplifies socio-ecological systems, indicates priority areas for intervention, and reduces risk and vulnerability. The lockdowns implemented during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in job losses, company closures, and economic recessions, demonstrating that linear approaches often over-emphasise on a limited set of attributes of a system, notably efficiency, at the expense of other aspects. While linear approaches have been beneficial to some extent for long, the Covid-19 pandemic exposed how they transfer stresses to other sectors, and compromise resilience-building initiatives, allowing failure to cascade from one sector to the other. Nexus planning emphasises on cross-sectoral sustainability and enhances socio-economic resilience against future shocks.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110376,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110376,Scopus,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110376,2021-01-01,,,
766,Distress and risk perception in people living with multiple sclerosis during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background People living with MS during COVID-19 are experiencing the disruptions of the pandemic and concerns that their health status may place them at greater risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes. Objective This study sought to understand how people living with MS in the United States experienced distress and perceived their COVID-19-related risk during the first surge of the pandemic. Methods This was a web-based, self-report survey of people with MS who were living in the United States during the early stage of COVID-19. Primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and positive-affect and well-being. Participants (N = 491) also provided data on demographics, MS-related factors, COVID-19 factors, and psychological coping. Results Psychological distress was associated with age, psychological coping strategies, and having had symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but not with MS disease-related variables and COVID-19 risk factors. Perception of COVID-19-related risk was associated with age, MS disease severity, COVID-19-related factors, and anxiety. Conclusion This study demonstrated that even during COVID-19, distress and risk perception are primarily driven by psychological factors, experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and age, with minimal contribution from individual differences in health status, providing an impetus for continued efforts to optimize psychological interventions for people living with MS.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102618,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102618,Scopus,10.1016/j.msard.2020.102618,2021-01-01,,,
767,Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Dental Care Providers on the Front Lines in China,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that emerged at the end of 2019. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a pandemic. To examine the psychological effects on dental care providers in China in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak and factors closely associated with those effects, we conducted a cross-sectional study online with 4 widely used self-administered questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the General Anxiety Disorder-7, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the variables that potentially affected the mental health of emergency dental care providers. As a result, 969 out of 1035 questionnaires were included in the analysis, with 642 respondents reporting more than 1 symptom (66.3%). The symptom of perceived stress was reported by the largest proportion of the respondents (66.2%, n = 641), and anxiety the least (7.1%, n = 69). After adjustment for confounders, it was found that dental practitioners with preexisting physical health conditions were at higher risk of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.972; 95% CI, 1.128-3.448; P = .017), and perceived stress (odds ratio, 2.397 95% CI, 1.283-4.478; P = .006). Additionally, feelings of fear, helplessness, or terror resulting from the possibility of contracting COVID-19 were significantly associated with the prevalence of all the 4 psychological symptoms observed (P < .05). In the present study, we found that dental care providers suffered psychological depression, stress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during COVID-19, which indicates the importance of psychological support at times of major epidemic outbreaks.

769,Depression and sexual functions in epilepsy patients: Comparison before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major health problem with a high rate of spread. We aimed to investigate herein the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on depression and sexual dysfunction in patients with epilepsy. Material and Methods One hundred and sixteen epilepsy patients admitted to our hospital from October–November 2019 were evaluated for sexual functions and depression using the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) and Beck Depression Scale, respectively. These scales were re-applied in June 2020 and July 2020 to assess the impact of the outbreak on sexual function and depression in the same group of patients. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded and analyzed in SPSS. Results During the pandemic period, the total Beck Depression Scale values increased significantly in the patients with epilepsy compared to the pre-pandemic period (P =0.048), and depressive symptoms showed an increasing trend (P =0.032). Although an increase in sexual dysfunction was also recorded, it was not statistically significant compared to the pre-pandemic period. In eight patients (6.9%), seizure frequency increased during the pandemic period. In the multivariate analysis, the only parameter that predicted the increase in seizure frequency was the number of drugs used. The Beck Depression Scale values were positively correlated with total male/female ASEX values, age, marital status, duration of illness, and seizure frequency. Conclusion The COVID-19 outbreak caused an increase in the tendency to depression in epilepsy patients and has also had a negative effect on sexual function. During public health outbreaks, clinicians should focus not only on seizure control in patients with epilepsy but also on their mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.006,2021-01-01,,,

People with physical disabilities, who commonly encounter daily challenges such as barriers to community mobility, reduced access to healthcare services and higher risk of suffering from depression, may face additional challenges in the context of the pandemic. Objective This study aims to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, among people with physical disabilities. Methods A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on August 10, 2020 through a search in six online databases to synthesize results from original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with physical disabilities. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health was used to describe the population and the personal and environmental factors with a unified and standard health language. Results Eleven records were extracted from 1621 individual papers retrieved from the search strategy. Various impacts on daily functioning such as a decrease in access to healthcare have been noted during the pandemic. Changes in social and lifestyle habits, mood changes and decreased levels of physical activity were also noted.

772,Depression reported by US adults in 2017–2018 and March and April 2020,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated social distancing and lockdown restrictions are expected to have substantial and enduring mental health effects. In this study, we aimed to assess depression levels before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Methods We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) brief screening instrument to detect probable depression in two nationally representative surveys of US adults. Pre-pandemic levels of depression were assessed in a sample of 5,075 adults from the 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was assessed in March (N = 6,819) and April 2020 (N = 5,428) in the Understanding America Study, a representative sample of the US population. Results The percentage of US adults with depression increased significantly from 8.7% (95% CI[7.6%–9.8%]) in 2017–2018 to 10.6% (95% CI[9.6%–11.6%) in March 2020 and 14.4% (95% CI[13.1%–15.7%]) in April 2020. Statistically significant increases in depression levels were observed for all population subgroups examined with the exception of those aged 65+ years and Black participants. Young adults (aged 18–34) experienced a marked increase in depression of 13.4 percentage points (95% CI [9.5%–17.2%]) that was larger than any other age group. Additional analyses of depression trends in NHANES from 2007/2008–2017/2018 showed that the substantial increase in depression in April 2020 was unlikely to be due to typical year-to-year variation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that depression levels have risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforce recent findings indicating that young adults may be particularly vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.065,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.065,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.065,2021-01-01,,,
773,Digital phenotyping and the COVID-19 pandemic: Capturing behavioral change in patients with psychiatric disorders,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented societal changes limiting us in our mobility and our ability to connect with others in person. These unusual but widespread changes provide a unique opportunity for studies using digital phenotyping tools. Digital phenotyping tools, such as mobile passive monitoring platforms (MPM), provide a new perspective on human behavior and hold promise to improve human behavioral research. However, there is currently little evidence that these tools can reliably detect changes in behavior. Considering the Considering the COVID-19 pandemic as a high impact common environmental factor we studied potential impact on behavior of participants using our mobile passive monitoring platform BEHAPP that was ambulatory tracking them during the COVID-19 pandemic. We pooled data from three MPM studies involving Schizophrenia (SZ), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) patients (N = 12). We compared the data collected on weekdays during three weeks prior and three weeks subsequent to the start of the quarantine. We hypothesized an increase in communication and a decrease in mobility. We observed a significant increase in the total time spent on communication applications (median 179 and 243 min per week respectively, p = 0.005), and a significant decrease in the number of unique places visited (median 6 and 3 visits per week respectively, p = 0.007), while the total time spent at home did not change significantly (median 64 and 77 h per week, respectively, p = 0.594).

The present study reports the results from 442 last year senior high school students who completed an online survey (16-30 April 2020) concerning the lockdown impact on their mental health. Overall, the rate of positive screen for depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 11) significantly increased from 48.5% to 63.8% and of those scoring within severe depression range (PHQ-9 ≥20) from 10% to 27%; for anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 11) increased from 23.8% to 49.5% and of those scoring within severe anxiety range (GAD-7≥17) from 3.8% to 20.5%. After taking sex and baseline (one month prior to the lockdown) levels of depression and anxiety into account, the level of lockdown experienced distress was predictive of depression and anxiety levels in time of home confinement, accounting for about 30% of variance in symptoms severity scores.

779,"Viral, host and environmental factors that favor anthropozoonotic spillover of coronaviruses: An opinionated review, focusing on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2","Environmental factors play a key role in the zoonotic transmission of emerging pathogenic viruses as mankind is constantly disturbing wildlife's ecosystems usually by cutting down forests to build human settlements or by catching wild animals for food, which deprives the viruses of their natural hosts and gives them opportunity to infect humans. In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged from bats and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Disease outbreaks such as SARS in 2002–2003, MERS in 2012 and the current COVID-19 pandemic are the result of higher mutation rates of coronaviruses and their unique capacity for genetic recombination, resulting in adaptations that make them more suitable to cross the species barriers and infect other species. This ability for host switching and interspecies infection is often attributed to the great diversity of these viruses, which is a result of viral and host factors such as the low fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the high frequency of their homologous RNA recombination, and the adaptation of the S protein to bind host receptors like the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in MERS-CoV. This review presents an overview of the zoonotic transmission of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, focusing on the viral, host and environmental factors that favor the spillover of these viruses into humans, as well as the biological and ecological factors that make bats the perfect animal reservoir of infection for these viruses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483,Scopus,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483,2021-01-01,,,

782,Why public health framing matters: An experimental study of the effects of COVID-19 framing on prejudice and xenophobia in the United States,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a notable increase in the expression of prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes that threaten the wellbeing of minority groups and contribute to the overall public health toll of the virus. However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113572,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113572,Scopus,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113572,2021-01-01,,,
783,COVID-19 and mental health in Brazil: Psychiatric symptoms in the general population,"Public health interventions at general population level are imperative in order to decrease the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but they may contribute to widespread emotional distress and increased risk for psychiatric illnesses. We report on the results of an investigation into the occurrence and determinants of psychiatric symptoms among the Brazilian general population (N = 1996). We assessed sociodemographic variables and general mental health (DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure), depression (PROMIS depression v.8a), anxiety (PROMIS anxiety v.8a), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale-IES-R scale) using an online web-based survey. Anxiety (81.9%), depression (68%), anger (64.5%), somatic symptoms (62.6%) and sleep problems (55.3%) were the most common psychiatric symptoms. Younger age, female gender, low income, lower level of education, longer period of social distancing, and self-reported history of previous psychiatric illness were strongly associated with higher severity of symptoms. Our results support the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the Brazilian population. The high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms observed in our sample indicates that the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered a public health problem in Brazil. The health systems and individual clinicians must be prepared to offer and implement specific interventions in order to identify and treat psychiatric issues.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.021,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.021,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.021,2021-01-01,,,
784,Psychological distress in the face of a pandemic: An observational study characterizing the impact of COVID-19 on immigrant outpatient mental health,"Undocumented immigrants have disproportionately suffered during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to factors including limited medical access and financial insecurity, which can exacerbate pandemic-associated distress. Psychological outcomes for immigrant outpatients were assessed after transition to telepsychiatry in March 2020. Mental health was assessed with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) inventories, a novel coronavirus-specific survey, and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10+). Feedback on telepsychiatry sessions and access to non-clinical resources were also gathered, after which multivariable linear regression modeling identified psychosocial factors underlying changes in distress levels. 48.57% and 45.71% of participants reported worsened anxiety and depression levels due to the pandemic, respectively. From March to April, PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores significantly increased by 0.81 and 0.63 points, respectively. The average total psychological distress score was 23.8, with 60% of scores reflecting serious mental illness. Factors that most influenced K10+ scores included a pre-existing depressive disorder, food insecurity, and comfort during telepsychiatry visits. 93.75% of participants believed access to remote psychiatry helped their mental health during COVID-19. The negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health in vulnerable populations stems from medical and psychosocial factors such as pre-existing psychiatric conditions and unmet essential needs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113595,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113595,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113595,2021-01-01,,,

789,The relationship between perceived stress and emotional distress during the COVID-19 outbreak: Effects of boredom proneness and coping style,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was a great threat to the physical and mental health of the general population. Our research aimed to investigate the relationship between perceived stress and emotional distress during the initial outbreak. Furthermore, potential risks and protective factors, i.e., coping and boredom proneness, of stress-related emotional distress were also explored. Data from 3233 participants in China were collected through an online survey platform during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 from January 31 to February 9 in 2020. Results showed that higher perceived stress was associated with more emotional distress including depression, fear, compulsion-anxiety, neurasthenia, and hypochondria. Boredom proneness significantly and positively mediated the relationship between perceived stress and emotional distress. Moreover, coping style moderated the stress-emotional distress relationship, i.e., individuals who mainly adopted positive coping strategies suffered fewer symptoms of depression, compulsion-anxiety, and neurasthenia under stress, while negative coping strategies aggravated emotional distress. These results from the present study provide practical value for mental health intervention during the emergent public health events.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102328,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102328,Scopus,10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102328,2021-01-01,,,

791,Psychological defence mechanisms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case series,"Background and objectives COVID-19 has had a negative effect on mental health across the world's population. Healthcare workers in particular have experienced increased levels of psychological distress, depression and anxiety. Any perceived stress to an individual can provoke psychological defence mechanisms. Using psychoanalytic theory, a defence mechanism is described as an unconscious psychological strategy, with or without resulting behaviour, which aims to reduce or eliminate anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful stimuli. This paper aims to describe a range of psychological defence mechanisms encountered within colleagues in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using the methodology of a case series, specific defence mechanisms are explored with reference to further literature in the field. Results The author has encountered varying psychological defence mechanisms, both within himself and in other members of the multidisciplinary team. These have been illustrated in the attached clinical vignettes, relating to the specific psychological coping mechanisms of; denial, hypochondriasis, altruism, sublimation and humour. Conclusion We encourage acknowledgement of psychological defence mechanisms and their implications on day to day practice. Whilst defence mechanisms can have a number of negative consequences as described in this article, they also have an important role, particularly in the case of mature defence mechanisms, as protective factors against psychological distress and symptom formation. Deeper understanding of the gold-standard hierarchical organisation of defence mechanisms could help increase utilisation of specific therapeutic interventions for enhancing changes from immature to mature defensive responses to stressful experiences as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2020.10.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2020.10.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejpsy.2020.10.005,2021-01-01,,,

793,Stress and coping during COVID-19 pandemic: Result of an online survey,"We intended to assess stress, anxiety, depression and coping strategies during COVID-19 pandemic. Through an online survey, we used primary care posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) screen for DSM 5 (PC-PTSD-5), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, along with coping methods. Of the respondents (n=733), a considerable proportion had moderate to severe anxiety (21.2%) and depression (15%). Stress symptoms, above the cut-off point of 3 in PC-PTSD-5 suggestive of probable PTSD, were present in 34.1%. Mental health problems were significantly associated with students, 20 to 30 year olds, those who are single, and university educated. Considerable proportions of healthcare workers presented with stress symptoms (21.4%), anxiety (5.6%) and depression (5.6%), however, the proportions were significantly less in comparison with others. Various coping strategies were reported; respondents who avoided thinking about the pandemic or seemed unsure of coping strategies and those struggling to cope had significantly greater anxiety and depression. As large proportions of people have anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms in relation to COVID-19, there is a need to establish a mental health support system that can address the need of the general population.

The experience, if borne out by further research, provides important lessons for policy discussions on the pandemic, as well as broader lessons about pragmatic responses to these key client groups irrespective of COVID-19. The overarching lesson seems that when government policy is well coordinated and underpinned by a science-driven and fundamentally pragmatic approach, morbidity and mortality can be reduced. Within this, the importance of strategic clarity and delivery, housing, lowered thresholds to methadone provision, Benzodiazepine (BZD) provision and Naloxone availability were key determinants of policy success. Further, this paper argues that the rapid collapse in policy barriers to these interventions that COVID-19 produced should be secured and protected while further research is conducted.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102966,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102966,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102966,2021-01-01,,,

800,Impact of outbreak COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatry emergencies in Spain,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused an unprecedented clinical situation. A retrospective cross-sectional study was designed with the aim to evaluate psychiatric emergencies from March 14 to May 1, 2020, coinciding with the start of the emergency state and the lockdown until the attenuation of the confinement. Data obtained during this period were compared with the emergencies attended in the same period of 2019. A total of 213 psychiatric emergencies were attended in 2020 compared with 367 in 2019. The mean number of emergencies per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (M=4.35, SD= 2.04) vs. the same period in 2019 (M=7.50, SD= 3.18). A higher percentage of patients with schizo/psychotic disorders (34.3% in 2020, vs. 24.3% in 2019), as well as a lower percentage of patients with anxiety/adaptive disorders (25.4% in 2020 vs. 35.4% in 2019) was observed during the outbreak. A significant lower mean discharge/emergency ratio (M=42.17, SD= 26.94 in 2020 vs. M=63.43, SD= 17.64 in 2019) and a higher referral to Internal Medicine/emergency ratio (M=20.55, SD= 22.16 in 2020 vs. M=3.32, SD= 6.63 in 2019) was observed.

802,"Risk factors for depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms in perinatal women during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background Pregnant women and women who recently gave birth are vulnerable to COVID-19-related psychosocial stresses. Methods We assessed COVID-19-related health worries and grief, and current mental health symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD) in 1,123 U.S. women during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 21 to August 17, 2020) through a cross-sectional study design. Results Among our respondents, 36.4% reported clinically significant levels of depression, 22.7% for generalized anxiety, and 10.3% for PTSD. Women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses based on their self-reported history were 1.6-to-3.7 more likely to score at clinically significant levels of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. Approximately 18% reported high levels of COVID-19-related health worries and were 2.6-to-4.2 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. Approximately 9% reported high levels of grief and were 4.8-to-5.5 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. Conclusions Perinatal women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses show elevated symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although causation cannot be inferred, COVID-19-related health worries and grief experiences may increase the likelihood of mental health symptoms among those without pre-existing mental health concerns.

806,Threat perceptions and the intention to acquire firearms,"Firearm sales have surged during COVID-19, raising concerns about a coming wave of suicide deaths. Little is known, however, about the individuals considering acquiring firearms during the pandemic. Recent research has highlighted that individuals considering acquiring firearms may be motivated by exaggerated threat expectancies. In a sample of 3,500 Americans matched to 2010 United States Census data, we compared individuals intending to buy firearms in the coming 12 months (assessed in late June and early July 2020) to those undecided or not planning to acquire firearms on a range of demographic, anxiety, and firearm ownership variables. Our results indicated that those intending to acquire a firearm in the next twelve months are less tolerant of uncertainty, endorse exaggerated threat expectancies, and are experiencing more severe COVID-19 specific fears. Individuals intending to purchase firearms were also more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation in the past year, to have worked in law enforcement, and to have been considered essential workers during COVID-19. Furthermore, such individuals were more likely to already own firearms and to have purchased firearms during the opening months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those intending to purchase firearms did not endorse lower perceived neighborhood safety, however, indicating that their intent to purchase firearms is unlikely to be driven by tangible threats in their immediate environment. These findings highlight that exaggerated fears may be motivating individuals to purchase firearms to diminish anxiety and that this trend may be particularly common among individuals who already own firearms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.033,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.033,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.033,2021-01-01,,,

We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological status, self-management behaviors, and diabetes care maintenance among Saudi adults with T1DM using insulin pump therapy. Methods This cross-sectional study used a web survey to collect data on Saudi adults with T1DM who were treated in the specialized insulin pump clinic at King Abdulaziz Medical City-Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7 scales to measure depression and anxiety. Results Of the 70 patients who received the survey, 65 completed it. Overall, 23.1% and 29.2% of the patients reported moderate to severe and mild depression, respectively; 18.5% and 24.6% reported moderate to severe and mild anxiety, respectively. Compared with pre-lockdown, adherence to a healthy diet and regular physical activity decreased in 67.7% and 41.5% of the patients, respectively. Most patients maintained their adherence to insulin pump behaviors; frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose increased in 47% of glucometer users. Most patients benefited from phone visits or virtual education sessions, but 66.2% of the patients reported difficulty obtaining at least one type of insulin pump supply. Conclusions Promoting self-management behaviors and psychological wellbeing of patients with T1DM using insulin pump therapy is crucial during a lockdown.

811,The influence of 2020 coronavirus lockdown on presentation of oral and maxillofacial trauma to a central London hospital,"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 was first identified in China in December 2019. Its spread resulted in a pandemic, with the United Kingdom entering a period of national lockdown on 23 March 2020 to reduce disease burden on the National Health Service (NHS). King’s College Hospital is a Major Trauma Centre serving an inner-city population of 700,000 with 120,000 patients attending the emergency department (ED) annually. We aimed to determine the effect of lockdown on OMFS trauma presentations and lessons learned from emergency service provision during a pandemic. All referrals to the oral and maxillofacial surgical (OMFS) team from ED during the first six weeks of the lockdown period – 23 March 2020 - 3 May 2020 – were compared with the same six-week period in 2019. A total of 111 referrals were made to OMFS during the first six weeks of the lockdown period in 2020 compared with 380 referrals in 2019. Of these, 50.5%, (n=192) were related to facial trauma in 2019 vs (63.1%, n=70) in 2020. Fewer patients were admitted under OMFS: 17.4% (n=35) in 2019 vs 2.9% (n=2) in 2020, and a greater number of patients were discharged from OMFS care directly from the ED: 63.2% (n=127) in 2019 vs 82.9% (n=58) in 2020. There was profound effect of the lockdown on referrals to OMFS from the ED, in number and type of diagnosis. This is potentially reflective of the increased availability of acute/emergency dental services in South-East London during the lockdown period. This gives us valuable insight for service planning in the event of further restrictions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.08.065,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.08.065,Scopus,10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.08.065,2021-01-01,,,

815,Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.,"South Korea was able to successfully control the spread of COVID-19 without nationwide lockdowns or drastic social distancing efforts, but pandemic-related psychological outcome of the general population remains unknown. Between March and June 2020, 400 South Korean residents participated in an online study of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis-risk and loneliness, as well as indices of social network, physical health and demographics. Clinical levels of depression, anxiety or stress were reported by 45% of the respondents, and psychosis-risk was present in 12.8%; a drastic increase above the base rate reported by previous studies conducted in South Korea prior to the pandemic. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea. Comprehensive efforts to address the psychological aftermath of the pandemic are urgently needed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113570,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113570,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113570,2021-01-01,,,

817,The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown on Caregivers of People With Dementia,"Background Caregivers of people with dementia (pwD) are at risk of depression, anxiety, and burden. COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed lockdown as a preventive measure might increase psychological symptoms in caregivers. The authors performed a study to measure the change of psychological symptoms during quarantine or self-isolation for COVID-19 in a sample of Italian caregivers of pwD, and to investigate if the resilience is associated with psychological changes in the sample. Methods Eighty-four caregivers of pwD completed an online survey including questionnaires assessing depressive symptomatology and anxiety before and during the lockdown, caregiver burden and levels of resilience. Results The multivariate analysis of variance revealed an effect of time (before and during the lockdown) in the whole group on depression scores; a significant interaction between time and resilience was found on anxiety scores, revealing that caregivers with high resilience showed a more significant increase of anxiety levels during lockdown than caregivers with low resilience. Moreover, the regression analysis revealed that caregiver burden was associated negatively with resilience scores, and positively with higher functional dependence. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown produced psychological consequences in caregivers of pwD, with an increase of levels of depression. Moreover, high resilience had a negative effect on anxiety levels and no effect on depressive symptomatology during the lockdown; moreover, it was associated with lower levels of caregiver burden. All caregivers, even those with high resilience levels, should be addressed to psychological interventions to reduce levels of depression, anxiety and caregiver burden.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.009,2021-01-01,,,

821,Cytosorb filter: An adjunct for survival in the COVID-19 patient in cytokine storm? a case report,"COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected not only the United States, but the entire world. The impact it has had has overwhelmed the entire healthcare system, from the unknown carrier status, poor testing capabilities to hospitals running out of ventilators for severely ill patients. There has been a variety of potential treatment modalities for the various forms of illness ranging from asymptomatic carriers to the ventilated ICU patients. These include anti-inflammatory medications, antibiotics, immune-modulators, convalescent plasma, and others. The cytokine storm that inflicts some patients can be devastating to the vital organs of the human body in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, coagulopathy, and death. Cytosorbents® cytokine filter is a potential treatment methodology aimed at reducing the cytokine storm, thus serving as a bridge for therapy in the acutely ill patients infected with COVID-19.

828,The provision of counseling to patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder: Telehealth innovations and challenges in the age of COVID-19,"Historically, federal and state policies have narrowly defined treatment models that have resulted in limited access to and engagement in counseling for individuals receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD; e.g., methadone and buprenorphine). In response to the coronavirus pandemic, outpatient MOUD treatment providers rapidly transitioned from traditional, in-person care delivery models to revised COVID-19 protocols that prioritized telehealth counseling to protect the health of patients and staff and ensure continuity in MOUD care. These telehealth innovations appear to mitigate many of the longstanding barriers to counseling in the traditional system and have the potential to forever alter MOUD care delivery. Drawing on data from a Rhode Island–based clinic, we argue that MOUD counseling is achievable via telehealth and outline the need for, and anticipated benefits of, hybrid telehealth/in-person MOUD treatment models moving forward.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108163,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108163,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108163,2021-01-01,,,

830,"Real-time suicide mortality data from police reports in Queensland, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic: an interrupted time-series analysis","Background Deaths by suicide can increase during infectious disease outbreaks. This study analysed suspected suicide rates in 2020 relative to 2015–19 to assess any early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland, Australia. Methods We analysed data from the interim Queensland Suicide Register (iQSR), a state-wide real-time suicide surveillance system, using an interrupted time-series design. The data source for the iQSR is the Form 1 police report of a death to a coroner. Two QSR staff independently classed the probability of a death by suicide as possible, probable, or beyond reasonable doubt. The analysis included the probable or beyond reasonable doubt categories as suspected suicides. The primary outcome was the monthly suspected suicide rate. We applied Poisson and negative binomial regressions to assess whether Queensland's Public Health Emergency Declaration on Jan 29, 2020, affected suspected suicides from Feb 1 to Aug 31, 2020. Secondary outcomes included absolute or relative changes in police-reported motives of recent unemployment, financial problems, domestic violence, and relationship breakdown. Findings 3793 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14·85 deaths per 100 000 people (from Jan 1, 2015, to Jan 31, 2020) before the declaration, and 443 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14·07 deaths per 100 000 people (Feb 1, 2020, onwards) after the declaration. An interrupted time-series Poisson regression model unadjusted (rate ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% CI 0·82–1·06) and adjusted for overdispersion, seasonality, and pre-exposure trends (RR 1·02, 95% CI 0·83–1·25) indicated no evidence of a change in suspected suicide rates. We found no absolute or relative increases in the motives for suspected suicides, including recent unemployment, financial problems, relationship breakdown, or domestic violence from February to August, 2020, compared with the pre-exposure period. Interpretation There does not yet appear to be an overall change in the suspected suicide rate in the 7 months since Queensland declared a public health emergency. Despite this, COVID-19 has contributed to some suspected suicides in Queensland. Ongoing community spread and increasing death rates of COVID-19, and its impact on national economies and mental health, reinforces the need for governments to maintain the monitoring and reporting of suicide mortality in real time.

Methods Members of a Norwegian fitness association were invited to fill out an online questionnaire including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), sleep disturbances and change in PA habits (decreased, unchanged, increased) during the COVID-19 lockdown from 12 March to 15 June 2020. Results A sample of 1281 members aged 19–81 years were included (31% females; mean ± SD age 49 ± 11.5). Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was 9.0% and 4.4%, respectively. During the lockdown period, 13.8% reduced, 21.9% increased and 64.3% did not change PA level. In total 21.9% reported sleeping disturbances. Anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were statistically significantly associated with sleep disturbances. Change in PA did not influence the association between mental health and sleep. Conclusion Compared to studies from the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were substantial lower in this Norwegian sample of relatively physically active adults. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with sleep disturbances, but change in PA level during the COVID-19 lockdown did not influence the association between mental health and sleep disturbances.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.030,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.030,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.030,2021-01-01,,,
837,Management of Chronic Pain in Nursing Homes: Navigating Challenges to Improve Person-Centered Care,"Despite the dynamic demands in the nursing home (NH), a definitive approach to managing chronic pain in older adults has yet to be established. Due to concerns for potential adverse pharmacologic effects, balancing appropriate pain management is a challenge among NH residents. The challenges encompass but are not limited to medical complexities, functional disabilities, and physical frailty. Barriers to the successful implementation of a comprehensive chronic pain management at the NH may include ambiguous directions on specific therapeutic interventions, insufficient guidance on treatment duration, and limited available treatment options. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ reporting requirement of adequate pain control among NH residents coupled with widely variable clinician-prescribing habits highlights the difficulties in overcoming the preceding challenges and barriers. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further complicated pain management due to its negative consequences on well-being of residents of NHs. Associated symptoms of psychosocial stress, anxiety and depression, and chronic pain symptoms can exacerbate during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased requirement for pain medications including but not limited to opioids. Pain is a multidimensional symptom and requires a strategic multimodal approach for its management. Nonpharmacologic modalities are underutilized in the NH setting and are the preferred first steps for mild pain, and nonopioid pharmacological agents can be added as a second step for a synergistic effect for moderate to severe pain. Opioids should be used as a last resort. Short-acting opioids are preferred over extended-release/long-acting opioids for chronic pain. Clinicians are encouraged to engage residents in proactive strategies in managing their pain, and to set realistic expectations toward improving their quality of life, as complete elimination of pain is not feasible in most cases. This review article provides the interdisciplinary team with a contemporary perspective of the multitude of changes and challenges influencing the prescribing as well as deprescribing of various pain medications.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.12.029,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.12.029,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamda.2020.12.029,2021-01-01,,,

841,Anxiety and depression symptoms of medical staff under COVID-19 epidemic in China,"Background It is well known that unexpected pandemic has led to an increase in mental health problems among a variety of populations. Methods In this study, an online non-probability sample survey was used to anonymously investigate the anxiety and depression symptoms among medical staff under the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaire included Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms were estimated by logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 1090 medical staff were investigated in this study. The estimated self-reported rates of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms and both of the two were 13.3%, 18.4% and 23.9% respectively. Factors associated with self-reported anxiety symptoms include married status (OR=2.3, 95%CI: 1.2, 4.4), not living alone (OR=0.4, 95%CI: 0.2, 0.7), never confiding their troubles to others (OR=2.2, 95%CI: 1.4, 3.5) and higher stress (OR=14.4, 95%CI: 7.8, 26.4). Factors associated with self-reported depression symptoms include not living alone (OR=0.4, 95%CI: 0.3, 0.7), sometimes/often getting care from neighbours (OR=0.6, 95%CI: 0.4, 0.9), never confiding their troubles to others (OR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.0) and higher stress (OR=9.7, 95%CI: 6.2, 15.2). Limitations The study was a non-probability sample survey. Besides, scales used in this study can only identify mental health states.

844,Evaluating the Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown on Long-Term Care Residents’ Mental Health: A Data-Driven Approach in New Brunswick,"Long-term care (LTC) residents, isolated because of the COVID-19 pandemic, are at increased risk for negative mental health outcomes. The purpose of our article is to demonstrate how the interRAI LTC facility (LTCF) assessment can inform clinical care and evaluate the effect of strategies to mitigate worsening mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a supporting analysis of the effects of lockdown in homes without COVID-19 outbreaks on depression, delirium, and behavior problems in a network of 7 LTC homes in New Brunswick, Canada, where mitigative strategies were deployed to minimize poor mental health outcomes (eg, virtual visits and increased student volunteers). This network meets regularly to review performance on risk-adjusted quality of care indicators from the interRAI LTCF and share learning through a community of practice model. We included 4209 assessments from 765 LTC residents between January 2017 to June 2020 and modeled the change within and between residents for depression, delirium, and behavioral problems over time with longitudinal generalized estimating equations. Though the number of residents who had in-person visits with family decreased from 73.2% before to 17.9% during lockdown (chi square, P < .001), the number of residents experiencing delirium (4.5%-3.5%, P = .51) and behavioral problems (35.5%-30.2%, P = .19) did not change. The proportion of residents with indications of depression decreased from 19.9% before to 11.5% during lockdown (P < .002). The final multivariate models indicate that the effect of lockdown was not statistically significant on depression, delirium, or behavioral problems. Our analyses demonstrate that poor mental health outcomes associated with lockdown can be mitigated with thoughtful intervention and ongoing evaluation with clinical information systems. Policy makers can use outputs to guide resource deployment, and researchers can examine the data to identify better management strategies for when pandemic strikes again.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.10.028,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.10.028,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamda.2020.10.028,2021-01-01,,,

Objective to study the differences between those who work away from home and those who do so from home, when the effects of fear of contagion cross with those of confinement, about the psychological distress during the COVID-19 in Spain. Design Observational descriptive cross-sectional study. Data sources The study was carried out receiving 1089 questionnaires from non-health workers that were working away from home and doing so from their homes. The questionnaire included sociodemographic and occupational data, physical symptoms, self-perceived health, use of preventive measures and possible contacts, and the Goldberg GHQ-12. Results 71.6% of non-health female workers and 52.4% of non-health male workers had psychological distress, with differences among those working away from home and those working from home. The level of psychological distress among non-health workers is predicted by 66.5% through the variables: being a woman, 43 years old or younger, having a home with no outdoor spaces, poor perception of health, number of symptoms, and having been in contact with contaminated people or material. Among workers who work away from home, being self-employed is another predictive variable of distress.

847,"Depressed, anxious, and stressed: What have healthcare workers on the frontlines in Egypt and Saudi Arabia experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Introduction As the Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) was declared by the world health organization a pandemic in March 2020, thousands of healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide were on the frontlines fighting against the pandemic. Herein, we selected two Middle East countries; Egypt and Saudi Arabia to investigate the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their HCWs. Methods In this cross-sectional study, a Google survey was used to access HCWs in many hospitals in Egypt and Saudi Arabia between the 14th and 24th of April 2020. The survey assessed HCWs regarding their sociodemographic and occupational features, sleeping hours, and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results This study included 426 HCWs (48.4% physicians, 24.2% nurses, and 27.4% other HCWs). Of them, 69% had depression, 58.9% had anxiety, 55.9% had stress, and 37.3% had inadequate sleeping (<6 h/day). Female sex, age ≤30 years, working in Egypt, attending emergency and night shifts, watching/reading COVID-19 news ≥2 h/day, and not getting emotional support from family, society, and hospital were associated with a high likelihood of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping. Limitations the cross-sectional design restricted our ability to distinguish between preexisting and emerging psychological symptoms. Conclusion HCWs on the frontlines in Egypt and Saudi Arabia experienced depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.080,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.080,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.080,2021-01-01,,,

850,The impact of SARS-CoV2 on the anxiety levels of subjects and on the anxiety and depression levels of their parents,"Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV2 outbreak was announced a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th, 2020. Both the pandemic itself and the restrictions were thought to create some psychological problems especially in patients with chronic illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic on daily lives of children with MS, and the anxiety status of these patients and anxiety - depression status of their parents. Methods This study was performed on a group of pediatric MS patients aged 8–18 years in Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, and Child Neurology Department. Thirty patients with MS and their 30 parents were enrolled to the study. The control group consisted of 49 healthy, age- and sex-matched children and their 49 parents. The patients (and their parents) were asked to complete a web-based survey evaluating access to health care and other changes in daily life between March 11th, 2020 and June 1st, 2020. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [which is composed of two parts; S-anxiety (STAI-S) and T-anxiety (STAI-T)] was administrated to the patients and healthy controls and the results were compared between the two groups to assess their anxiety levels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) [which is composed of two parts; HAD-anxiety (HAD-A) and HAD-depression (HAD-D)] was also given to all parents. The results of the HAD tests were compared between the two groups statistically. Results The results of the web-based survey showed that 4 of 9 (44.4%) patients, who had a regular workout program, left the program and 13 (43.3%) patients put on weight during the pandemic. Twenty-two patients (73.3%) could not get direct exposure to sunlight because of the curfew. Therefore, approximately half of the patients started to take vitamin D supplement. Most of the patients (80%) thought that they had higher risk and believed that they would have severe symptoms compared to healthy people. Twenty one (70%) patients disrupted their regular health checks and the most frequent causes were identified as closure of policlinics to routine patient care (33%) and concerns of getting SARS-CoV2 infection (26,6%). Two of 3 patients who had an MS attack did not go to the doctor during this period. The mean STAI-S scores in MS patients were significantly higher compared to the healthy controls (p=<0.001). The level of S-anxiety in all patients was higher compared to the cut off value.The mean HAD A score was found to be significantly higher in them compared to the parents of healthy individuals (p = 0.001). Conclusion Our results showed that children with MS had negative changes in daily life and high anxiety levels during the pandemic. Since MS patients have also psychiatric comorbidities, they may need psychosocial support especially in this period. Besides, establishment of separate health centers to be used during pandemics for children with chronic illnesses such as MS may be recommended to facilitate access to health care.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102595,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102595,Scopus,10.1016/j.msard.2020.102595,2021-01-01,,,

856,Clinically distinct COVID-19 cases share notably similar immune response progression: A follow-up analysis,"Inflammatory responses to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, range from asymptomatic to severe. Here we present a follow-up analysis of a longitudinal study characterizing COVID-19 immune responses from a father and son with distinctly different clinical courses. The father required a lengthy hospital stay for severe symptoms, whereas his son had mild symptoms and no fever yet tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 29 days. Father and son, as well as another unrelated COVID-19 patient, displayed a robust increase of SERPING1, the transcript encoding C1 esterase inhibitor (C1–INH). We further bolstered this finding by incorporating a serum proteomics dataset and found that serum C1–INH was consistently increased in COVID-19 patients. C1–INH is a central regulator of the contact and complement systems, potentially linking COVID-19 to complement hyperactivation, fibrin clot formation, and immune depression. Furthermore, despite distinct clinical cases, significant parallels were observed in transcripts involved in interferon and B cell signaling. As symptoms were resolving, widespread decreases were seen in immune-related transcripts to levels below those of healthy controls. Our study provides insight into the immune responses of likely millions of people with extremely mild symptoms who may not be aware of their infection with SARS-CoV-2 and implies a potential for long-lasting consequences that could contribute to reinfection risk.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05877,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05877,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05877,2021-01-01,,,

890,"Benefits of Sexual Activity on Psychological, Relational, and Sexual Health During the COVID-19 Breakout","Background The COVID-19–related lockdown has profoundly changed human behaviors and habits, impairing general and psychological well-being. Along with psychosocial consequences, it is possible that sexual behavior was also affected. Aims With the present study, we evaluated the impact of the community-wide containment and consequent social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health through standardized psychometric tools. Methods A case-control study was performed through a web-based survey and comparing subjects of both genders with (group A, N = 2,608) and without (group B, N = 4,213) sexual activity during lockdown. The Welch and chi-square tests were used to assess differences between groups. Univariate analysis of covariance, logistic regression models, and structural equation modeling were performed to measure influence and mediation effects of sexual activity on psychological, relational, and sexual outcomes. Outcomes Main outcome measures were General Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Dyadic Adjustment Scale for quality of relationship and a set of well-validated sexological inventories (International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, and male-female versions of the Orgasmometer). Results Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in subjects sexually active during lockdown. Analysis of covariance identified gender, sexual activity, and living without partner during lockdown as significantly affecting anxiety and depression scores (P < .0001). Logistic regression models showed that lack of sexual activity during lockdown was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing anxiety and depression (OR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.12 - 1.57, P < .001] and 1.34 [95% CI: 1.15 - 1.57, P < .0001], respectively). Structural equation modeling evidenced the protective role of sexual activity toward psychological distress (βmales = -0.18 and βfemales = -0.14), relational health (βmales = 0.26 and βfemales = 0.29) and sexual health, both directly (βmales = 0.43 and βfemales = 0.31), and indirectly (βmales = 0.13 and βfemales = 0.13). Clinical translation The demonstrated mutual influence of sexual health on psychological and relational health could direct the clinical community toward a reinterpretation of the relationship among these factors. Strengths and limitations Based on a large number of subjects and well-validated psychometric tools, this study elucidated the protective role of sexual activity for psychological distress, as well for relational and sexual health. Main limitations were the web-based characteristics of the protocol and the retrospective nature of prelockdown data on psychorelational and sexual health of subjects recruited. Conclusions COVID-19 lockdown dramatically impacted on psychological, relational, and sexual health of the population.

893,Understanding the genetic contribution of the human leukocyte antigen system to common major psychiatric disorders in a world pandemic context,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a complex genetic system that encodes proteins which predominantly regulate immune/inflammatory processes. It can be involved in a variety of immuno-inflammatory disorders ranging from infections to autoimmunity and cancers. The HLA system is also suggested to be involved in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity, especially through microglia regulation and synaptic pruning. Consequently, this highly polymorphic gene region has recently emerged as a major player in the etiology of several major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder and with less evidence for major depressive disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We thus review here the role of HLA genes in particular subgroups of psychiatric disorders and foresee their potential implication in future research. In particular, given the prominent role that the HLA system plays in the regulation of viral infection, this review is particularly timely in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.033,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.033,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.033,2021-01-01,,,

896,The Protective Roles of Exercise and Maintenance of Daily Living Routines for Chinese Adolescents During the COVID-19 Quarantine Period,"Purpose Adolescents are particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 quarantine periods and may be at risk for developing psychological distress symptoms that extend beyond a crisis, including depression. This study examined adolescents’ postquarantine depressive symptoms associated with pandemic stressors. The primary aim was to identify potential protective factors that may buffer the association between the presence of COVID-19 cases in adolescents’ communities and their postquarantine depressive symptoms. Methods Adolescents from public schools were recruited from Zhengzhou city, Henan, China (N = 1,487, M age=13.14 years, 50% girls). Adolescents reported the presence of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in their communities, their daily activities and routines during the 2-month quarantine period, and depressive symptoms after the quarantine period. Results The presence of cases in adolescents’ communities during the quarantine contributed to more depressive symptoms in adolescents after the quarantine. This association was buffered by adolescents’ spending more time on physical activities and better maintenance of daily living routines during the quarantine period. The presence of community infection was also more strongly associated with depressive symptoms in older adolescents. Conclusions The presence of COVID-19 cases in communities contributed to adolescents’ poorer mental health, and the association was stronger for older adolescents. Spending time on physical activities and maintaining daily living routines during the quarantine appear to be practical strategies that can be used by adolescents to mitigate the association between pandemic stressors and their diminishing mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.026,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.026,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.026,2021-01-01,,,

901,Changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement due to COVID-19 and depressive symptomatology: A cross-sectional a population-based study,"Background The measures adopted to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries included mobility and social restrictions that produced an immediate impact on the lifestyle of their inhabitants. Methods We assessed the association between the consequences of these measures and depressive symptomatology using a population-based sample of 692 individuals aged 18 or over from an ongoing study in the province of Girona (Catalonia, Spain). Participants responded to a telephone-based survey that included questions related to the consequences of confinement and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to identify which changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement were independently associated with a possible depression episode and depressive symptomatology. Results The prevalence of a possible depressive episode during the confinement was 12.7% (95% CI = 10.3–15.4). An adverse work situation, expected economic distress, self-reported worsening of the mental health and of the dietary pattern, and worries about a relative's potential infection were variables related to an increased risk of having a possible depressive episode. The changes in lifestyle accounted for 32% of the variance of the PHQ-9 score. Conclusion The findings indicate an association of the job situation, the expected negative economic consequences, the perceived worsening of health and habits, and the worries about COVID-19 infection with depressive symptomatology during the confinement.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152214,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152214,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152214,2021-01-01,,,

904,Traditional Chinese herbal medicine at the forefront battle against COVID-19: Clinical experience and scientific basis,"Background Throughout the 5000-year history of China, more than 300 epidemics were recorded. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCM) has been used effectively to combat each of these epidemics’ infections, and saved many lives. To date, there are hundreds of herbal TCM formulae developed for the purpose of prevention and treatment during epidemic infections. When COVID-19 ravaged the Wuhan district in China in early January 2020, without a deep understanding about the nature of COVID-19, patients admitted to the TCM Hospital in Wuhan were immediately treated with TCM and reported later with >90% efficacy. Approach We conducted conduct a systematic survey of various TCM herbal preparations used in Wuhan and to review their efficacy, according to the published clinical data; and, secondly, to find the most popular herbs used in these preparations and look into the opportunity of future research in the isolation and identification of bioactive natural products for fighting COVID-19. Results Although bioactive natural products in these herbal preparations may have direct antiviral activities, TCM employed for fighting epidemic infections was primarily based on the TCM theory of restoring the balance of the human immune system, thereby defeating the viral infection indirectly. In addition, certain TCM teachings relevant to the meridian system deserve better attention. For instance, many TCM herbal preparations target the lung meridian, which connects the lung and large intestine. This interconnection between the lung, including the upper respiratory system, and the intestine, may explain why certain TCM formulae showed excellent relief of lung congestion and diarrhea, two characteristics of COVID-19 infection. Conclusion There is good reason for us to learn from ancient wisdom and accumulated clinical experience, in combination with cutting edge science and technologies, to fight with the devastating COVID-19 pandemic now and emerging new coronaviruses in the future.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153337,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153337,Scopus,10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153337,2021-01-01,,,
905,"Phenotyping mental health: Age, community size, and depression differently modulate COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety","Introduction When the first COVID-19 infections were reported in Germany, fear and anxiety spread faster than the pandemic itself. While moderate amounts of fear of a COVID-19 infection may be functional, generalized anxiety and the potentially resulting distress and psychopathology may possibly be detrimental to people's health. Authorities need to avoid a countrywide panic, on the one hand, but foster a realistic awareness of the actual threat, on the other hand. Objectives The current cross-sectional study aimed to investigate psychological reactions in response to the real or perceived infection threats. In particular, the analysis should reveal whether COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety in times of COVID-19 have distinct correlates. Methods A nationwide study was conducted from March 10th to May 4th 2020 in Germany (n = 15,308; 10,824 women, 4433 men, 51 other). Generalized anxiety was assessed using the GAD-7, while COVID-19-related fear was measured using a self-generated item. Both outcome variables were entered into linear regression models. Demographic information, depressive symptoms, trust in governmental interventions, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 and media use were used to predict generalized anxiety and COVID-19-related fear. Results The data revealed distinct correlates of COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety. Although COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety had overlapping predictors, such as neuroticism, they most prominently differed in age distribution and direction of an urban-rural disparity: generalized anxiety decreases with age, but COVID-19-related fear is most pronounced in elderly participants. Generalized anxiety is also more prevalent in rural communities, but COVID-19-related fear is elevated in metropoles. Furthermore, the presence of a risk disease increases COVID-19-related fear, but not generalized anxiety. Conclusion These results suggest that COVID-19-related fear is often justified considering the individual risk of infection or complication due to infection. Some of the characteristics that predict COVID-19-related fear leave generalized anxiety unaffected or show divergent predictive directions. The present findings hint toward two related, but discriminant constructs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152218,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152218,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152218,2021-01-01,,,

911,The immediate impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on subjective sleep status,"Background An outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been ongoing in China since January 2020. The threat of infection affects the work and life of most of the population and may also damage sleep. This study aims to examine the subjective sleep status and mental health of the population during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. Method The data were collected through an online questionnaire with a sample of 5461 individuals in China from February 5, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Participants were divided into four groups based on their degree of threat from COVID-19: Group 1 was most closely associated with COVID-19, including inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, first-line hospital workers and first-line management staff; Group 2 included outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients who developed a fever and visited the hospital; Group 3 included people related to Group 1 or 2, such as their colleagues, relatives, friends and rescuers; and Group 4 was the farthest removed from contact with COVID-19, covering the general public affected by COVID-19 prevention strategies. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were used. Results Threat degree of COVID-19 (groups) had significant correlations with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Age, gender, and area (Hubei province or other provinces) had significant correlations with insomnia (p < 0.01). A total of 1380 (24.46%) participants were suspected of having major depression based on the PHQ-9. Additionally, 1042 (18.47%) participants were suspected of having generalized anxiety disorder based on the GAD-7. A total of 892 (15.8%) of the participants had Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) according to the ASDS. The prevalence of clinical insomnia during the outbreak was 20.05% (1131) according to the ISI. The factors of satisfaction with the current sleep pattern and how perceptible the symptoms of the current sleep pattern are to other people (p < 0.05) and the middle (difficulty staying asleep) and terminal (waking up too early) (p < 0.01) factors of the ISI were significantly different across groups. A total of 1129 (20.01%) participants spent more than one hour awake in bed. Conclusion The results indicated that insomnia is more severe in people who are female, young, living in the epicenter and experiencing a high degree of threat from COVID-19.

Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods We identified the proportion of normal, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety before and during the social distancing restrictions in adults from southern Brazil. An online, self-administered questionnaire was delivered for residents within the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were examined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results Most of the participants (n = 2314) aged between 31 and 59 years (54.2%), were women (76.6%), White (90.6%) with a university degree (66.6%). Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were reported in 3.9% and 4.5% of participants, respectively, before COVID-19. During the pandemic (June–July, 2020), these proportions increased to 29.1% (6.6-fold increase) and 37.8% (7.4-fold increase), respectively. Higher rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms were observed among women, those aged 18–30 years, diagnosed with chronic disease and participants who had their income negatively affected by social restrictions. Remaining active or becoming physically active during social distancing restrictions reduced the probability of aggravated mental health disorders. Conclusions Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a 6.6- and 7.4-fold increase since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The standard theory of its anthelmintic and insecticidal mode of action is that it is a selective positive allosteric modulator of glutamate-gated chloride channels found in nematodes and insects. At higher concentrations, ivermectin also acts as an allosteric modulator of ion channels found in host central nervous systems. In addition, in tissue culture, at concentrations higher than anthelmintic concentrations, ivermectin shows antiviral, antimalarial, antimetabolic, and anticancer effects. Caution is required before extrapolating from these preliminary repositioning experiments to clinical use, particularly for Covid-19 treatment, because of the high concentrations of ivermectin used in tissue-culture experiments.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2020.10.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2020.10.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.pt.2020.10.005,2021-01-01,,,

919,Telemedicine and the rural dementia population: A systematic review,"Background Telemedicine is a timely solution for the restrictions that COVID-19 social distancing places upon conventional modalities of healthcare provision. Geriatric populations affected by dementia require greater access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. As such, the aim of this systematic review is to examine the impact of telemedicine on health outcomes in elderly individuals with dementia living in rural areas. Methods A systematic review was completed using Ovid Medline, Web of Science and ACM Digital Libraries. The keywords for the selection of articles were: (telemedicine OR Telehealth) AND (Rural) AND (Age* OR Eld*) AND (Dementia) and (Telemedicine) AND (Rural Health OR Rural Population OR Hospitals, Rural OR Rural Health Services) AND (Aged OR Aging) AND (Dementia OR Multi-Infarct Dementia OR Vascular Dementia OR Frontotemporal Dementia). Among the 94 articles identified, 79 (84.0 %) were screened, 58 (61.7 %) were assessed and 12 (12.8 %) were included. Results The studies had diverse populations. Two were conducted in Australia, five in Canada, one in Korea, and four in the United States of America. The studies used a variety of cognitive tests and reported mixed results regarding the differences in patient performance when assessed in-person as compared to telemedicine consultation. Overall, both patients and physicians reported satisfaction with telemedicine; however, there were mixed results regarding the reliability of cognitive tests and the infrastructure required. Convenience, satisfaction, comfort and recommending telemedicine were reported to be high in the telemedicine group and physicians reported they would use telemedicine again.

921,"Prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during COVID-19 pandemic","Background The COVID-19 pandemic is putting healthcare workers across the world in an unprecedented situation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the potential factors associated with them. Materials and methods A self-designed online questionnaire survey, which consisted of the demographic and selected features, the occupational protection knowledge, attitudes, and practices of COVID-19, and the Chinese version of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, were used to assess the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during COVID-19 pandemic. The logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the potential factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results A total of 617 pediatric nurses were included in the survey. A considerable proportion of pediatric nurses reported symptoms of depression (95 [15.4%]), anxiety (201 [32.6%]), and stress (111 [18.0%]). Results of multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that the good occupational protection practices (for depression: OR = 0.455, 95%CI: 0.281 to 0.739; for anxiety: OR = 0.597, 95%CI: 0.419 to 0.851; for stress: OR = 0.269, 95%CI: 0.166 to 0.438) and the personal protective equipment (PPE) meeting work requirements (for depression: OR = 0.438, 95%CI: 0.246 to 0.778; for anxiety: OR = 0.581, 95%CI: 0.352 to 0.959; for stress: OR = 0.504, 95%CI: 0.283 to 0.898) were independent protective factors against depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Yet, working in an isolation ward or fever clinic was an independent risk factor associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively (for depression: OR = 1.809, 95%CI: 1.103 to 2.966; for anxiety: OR = 1.864, 95%CI: 1.221 to 2.846; for stress: OR = 2.974, 95%CI: 1.866 to 4.741). Having suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the departments (OR = 1.554, 95%CI: 1.053 to 2.294) and coming in contact with the patient's bodily fluids or blood (OR = 1.469, 95%CI: 1.031 to 2.095) were independent risk factors for anxiety, while >3 times of training for COVID-19 related information was an independent protective factor for depression (OR = 0.592, 95%CI: 0.360 to 0.974). Moreover, >10 years of working was an independent risk factor for stress (OR = 1.678, 95%CI: 1.075 to 2.618). Conclusion During the COVID-19 outbreak, a considerable proportion of Hubei pediatric nurses had psychological problems. The pediatric nurses endorsing the higher number of risk factors should be given special attention and necessary psychological intervention. Improving the levels of PPE so as to meet the work requirements and intensifying occupational protection practices might help safeguard pediatric nurses from depression, anxiety, and stress.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152217,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152217,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152217,2021-01-01,,,

927,Children and COVID19: Understanding impact on the growth trajectory of an evolving generation,"The COVID19 pandemic has forced the world to be closed in a shell. It has affected large population worldwide, but studies regarding its effect on children very limited. The majority of the children, who may not be able to grasp the entire emergency, are at a bigger risk with other problems lurking behind the attack of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The risk of infection in children was 1.3%, 1.5%, and 1.7% of total confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, Italy and United States respectively which is less compared to 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), when 5–7% of the positive cases were children, with no deaths reported while another recent multinational multicentric study from Europe which included 582 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) confirmed children of 0–18 year of age, provide deeper and generalize incite about clinical effects of COVID19 infection in children. According to this study 25% children have some pre-existing illness and 8% required ICU (intensive care unit) admission with 0.69% case fatality among all infected children. Common risk factor for serious illness as per this study are younger age, male sex and pre-existing underlying chronic medical condition. However, we need to be more concerned about possible implications of indirect and parallel psychosocial and mental health damage due to closure of schools, being in confinement and lack of peer interaction due to COVID19 related lockdown and other containment measures. The effects can range from mood swings, depression, anxiety symptoms to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, while no meaningful impact on COVID19 related mortality reduction is evident with school closure measures. The objective of this paper is to look at both the positive & negative effects in children due to COVID19 related indirect effects following lockdown and other containment measures. There is a need to gear up in advance with psychological strategies to deal with it post the pandemic by involving all stakeholders (parents, teachers, paediatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, psychiatric social workers, counsellors), proposing an integrated approach to help the children to overcome the pandemic aftermath.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105754,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105754,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105754,2021-01-01,,,

This study aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on frontline nurses in China. Methods A multicenter, cross-sectional survey of frontline nurses was conducted via online questionnaires. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatic disorders, and suicidal ideation were evaluated. Demographic, stress, and support variables were entered into logistic regression analysis to identify the impact factors. Findings Of the 4,692 nurses who completed the survey, 9.4% (n = 442) were considered to have depressive symptoms, 8.1% (n = 379) represented anxiety, and 42.7% (n = 2,005) had somatic symptom. About 6.5% (n = 306) respondents had suicidal ideation. Discussion The study showed that the overall mental health of frontline nurses was generally poor during COVID-19 outbreak, and several impact factors associated with nurses’ psychological health were identified.

951,What motivates Chinese consumers to avoid information about the COVID-19 pandemic?: The perspective of the stimulus-organism-response model,"This study investigated consumers’ information-avoidance behavior in the context of a public health emergency—the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, it proposes a model for exploring the effects of external stimuli (perceived threat and perceived information overload) related to COVID-19 on consumers’ internal states (sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance) and their subsequent behavioral intentions to avoid health information and engage in preventive behaviors. With a survey sample (N = 721), we empirically examined the proposed model and tested the hypotheses. The results indicate that sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance, which were a result of perceived threat and perceived information overload, had heterogeneous effects on information avoidance. Anxiety and cognitive dissonance increased information avoidance intention, while sadness decreased information avoidance intention. Moreover, information avoidance predicted a reluctance on the part of consumers to engage in preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings not only contribute to the information behavior literature and extend the concept of information avoidance to a public health emergency context, but also yield practical insights for global pandemic control.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102407,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102407,Scopus,10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102407,2021-01-01,,,

Trait emotional intelligence correlated positively with baseline positive affect and positive intensity, while negatively with baseline negative affect and negative intensity. Trait emotional intelligence marginally significantly predicted a lower frequency of anger, disgust, and sadness during the first week of the pandemic. Trait emotional intelligence predicted a lower intensity of fear, anxiety and sadness. The study showed a complex dynamics of emotional experiences during the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic. Positive states of relaxation and happiness were experienced more frequently and more intensely compared to the negatively-valenced emotions.

The psychiatric status was assessed using Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of almost 50 days following the diagnosis, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s). Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, stigmatization, and a negative view on the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients are prone to substantial psychological distress in the first few months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were frequent in this period, and these were closely related to the posttraumatic symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113604,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113604,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113604,2021-01-01,,,

967,Mental health toll from the coronavirus: Social media usage reveals Wuhan residents’ depression and secondary trauma in the COVID-19 outbreak,"This study investigates the possible association between social media usage and the mental health toll from the coronavirus at the peak of Wuhan's COVID-19 outbreak. Informed by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication Model and Health Belief Model, it proposes a conceptual model to study how people in Wuhan – the first epicenter of the global COVID-19 pandemic – used social media and its effects on users' mental health conditions and health behavior change. The results show that social media usage was related to both depression and secondary trauma, which also predicted health behavior change. But no relation was detected between health behavior change and mental health conditions. As the virus struck, social media usage was rewarding to Wuhan people who gained informational, emotional, and peer support from the health information shared on social media. An excessive use of social media, however, led to mental health issues. The results imply that taking a social media break may promote well-being during the pandemic, which is crucial to mitigating mental health harm inflicted by the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106524,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106524,Scopus,10.1016/j.chb.2020.106524,2021-01-01,,,

969,Psychological Risk Factors of Functional Impairment After COVID-19 Deaths,"Context People bereaved from COVID-19 report higher levels of grief than people bereaved from natural causes. The full impact of this onslaught of grief will not be known for some time. Ensuring high-quality bereavement care in the context of COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to end-of-life care. Objectives We aimed to determine how psychological symptoms explain functional impairment. Methods A sample of people bereaved through COVID-19 (N = 307) in the United States completed demographic questions and self-report measures of neuroticism; symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress, separation distress, and dysfunctional grief; and functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss. Results Most participants’ scores were in the clinical ranges for generalized anxiety, depression, dysfunctional grief, and functional impairment. Functional impairment scores were not associated with age, gender, and time since loss but were associated with being diagnosed with COVID-19, having received professional help with the loss, and a close relationship to the deceased. A logistic regression model showed that, after controlling for covariates, the odds of functional impairment significantly increased by 27% for higher scores in separation distress, 25% for higher scores in dysfunctional grief, and 13% for higher scores in posttraumatic stress. Conclusion People bereaved because of COVID-19 are at risk of functional impairment, especially if they have symptoms of separation distress, dysfunctional grief, and/or posttraumatic stress. Attention to identifying and treating functional impairment may be important in facilitating grieving persons’ full participation in social and economic life during and after the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.01.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.01.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.01.006,2021-01-01,,,
970,Assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak and its related factors on Lebanese individuals with physical disabilities,"Background In February 2020, the Lebanese authorities announced the first Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) case. Since then, the cases increased significantly, but information on the public’s psychological status and specifically individuals with physical disabilities is still limited. Purpose The study aims to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Lebanese individuals with physical disabilities and study the associated factors. Materials and methods This is a cross-sectional study involving 118 individuals with physical disabilities. Each filled out an online survey with three sections: a personal questionnaire, the Arabic versions of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 and the Fear of COVID-19 scale. Data regarding participants’ baseline characteristics, fear, anxiety, and depression were collected and analyzed using the Chi-square test and regressions models. Results Individuals with physical disabilities exhibited mild fear of COVID-19, with fear being correlated with age, educational level, and employment status. Furthermore, 22.9% of the population was found to be anxious, and 31.5% were depressed. Anxiety was associated with both marital status and employment status. Finally, depression was proved to be influenced by marital status, employment, and educational level. Conclusion Results extracted showed that individuals with physical disabilities require substantial attention in order to manage their psychological state during pandemics.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101073,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101073,Scopus,10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101073,2021-01-01,,,

972,"Physical inactivity and elevated TV-viewing reported changes during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with mental health: A survey with 43,995 Brazilian adults","Objective To analyze the associations of physical activity and TV-viewing reported changes during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine with mental health among Brazilian adults with and without depression. Methods Data of 43,995 Brazilian adults from a cross-sectional, nationwide behavior research were used. Participants reported the frequency on loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen or depressed) and anxiety (feel worried, anxious or nervous) feelings during the pandemic period. Frequency and duration of physical activity as well as duration of TV-viewing before and during the pandemic period were also reported. We created four categories of reported changes in physical activity (1-consistently active, 2-become active, 3-become inactive or 4-consistently inactive) and TV-viewing (1-consistently high, 2-become low, 3-become high or 4-consistently high). Participants also reported previous diagnoses of depression [yes (PD) or no (nPD). Logistic regression models separating people with and without depression were created. Results Compared to consistently active participants, to become inactive during the pandemic was associated with a higher odds for loneliness [nPD:OR:1.32 (95%CI,1.02–1.70); PD:2.22 (1.21–4.06)], sadness [nPD:1.34 (1.01–1.77); PD:2.88 (1.54–5.36)], and anxiety [nPD:1.71 (1.30–2.25); PD:2.55 (1.20–5.42)]. Also, people with depression and consistently physically inactive presented higher odds for loneliness and sadness. Compared to consistently low TV-viewing, participants that become with high TV-viewing showed higher odds for loneliness [nPD:1.59 (1.37–1.86)], sadness [nPD:1.68 (1.44–1.96); PD:1.61 (1.21 to 2.15)] and anxiety [nPD:1.73 (1.48–2.02); PD:1.58 (1.12–2.23)]. Conclusions Reported increases in physical inactivity and TV-viewing during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with poorer mental health indicators.

975,Can we predict who will be more anxious and depressed in the COVID-19 ward?,"Objective Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for anxiety and depression, but most studies about mental health during the pandemic included the general public, healthcare workers, and students. We aimed to explore the anxiety and depression levels, prevalence and predictors in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods In this cross-sectional, exploratory study, sociodemographic and clinical features of 281 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were explored. Patients underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered through a telephonic interview. Results The mean age of the participants was 55.0 ± 14.9 years. One hundred forty-three (50.9%) patients were male, and 138 (49.1%) were female. Ninety-eight (34.9%) patients had significant levels of anxiety and 118 (42.0%) had significant levels of depression. Female gender, staying alone in a hospital room, early days of hospital stay, and any lifetime psychiatric disorder was associated with symptoms of anxiety. Being over 50 years of age, staying alone in a hospital room, and NSAID use before the week of hospital admission were associated with symptoms of depression. Anxiety and depression levels were lower when family members who tested positive for COVID-19 stayed in the same hospital room during treatment. Conclusion Women, patients >50 years, patients who used NSAIDs before hospital admission, and those with lifetime psychiatric disorders may be at risk for anxiety and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 ward. Allowing family members with COVID-19 to stay in the same hospital room may be associated with lower anxiety and depression levels.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110302,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110302,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110302,2021-01-01,,,

983,Depression and insomnia in COVID-19 survivors: a cross-sectional survey from Chinese rehabilitation centers in Anhui province,"Background Suffering from COVID-19 is a strong psychological stressor to the patients. Even after recovery, patients are prone to a variety of mental health problems. Recently, some studies focus on the psychological situation of patients when they got COVID-19. However, no study focused on the psychological status of recovered COVID-19-infected patients in China. Our study aims to investigate sleep and mood status, and detect the influencing factors of the psychological status of the COVID-19 patients after recovery. Methods One hundred and twenty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled from February to April 2020. The social demographic information of all participants was collected by a self-designed questionnaire. Insomnia and depression symptoms were evaluated through the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D). Results The rates of insomnia and depression were 26.45% and 9.92% in the COVID-19 patients after recovery. There were significant differences in physical, mental impairment, and the need for psychological assistance between the COVID-19 recovered patients with depression and the patients without depression. In addition, age and health status may be the influencing factors for insomnia, and care about the views of others may be the influencing factor of depression (P < 0.05).

Prior studies on COVID-19-related risk perception primarily focused on the general public, with little data available on COVID-19 patients. Purpose To investigate COVID-19 patients’ risk perception, knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states in the epicenter, Wuhan, during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods Data were collected online using self-administered electronic questionnaire developed with reference to previous relevant studies and publications by the World Health Organization. Findings A higher level of perceived risk was found in relation to COVID-19 as compared to other potential health threats. Knowledge gaps existed regarding transmission and prevention of COVID-19. Additionally, risk perception was negatively related to knowledge and positively related to depressive states. Moreover, social media was a primary source for COVID-19 information, whereas the most trusted sources were health professionals. Discussion Realistic perception of risk should be encouraged considering both physical and mental health while developing relevant strategies.

To answer them, natural variability in policy implementation across US states and over time was analyzed to determine if mitigation policies correlated with Google searches for terms associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Findings indicated that restaurant/bar limits and stay-at-home orders correlated with immediate increases in searches for isolation and worry but the effects tapered off two to four weeks after their respective peaks. Moreover, the policies correlated with a reduction in searches for antidepressants and suicide, thus revealing no evidence of increases in severe symptomatology.

1001,"Suspension of fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic: views, emotional reactions and psychological distress among women undergoing fertility treatment","Research question What are the views and emotional reactions of patients towards the suspension of fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what are the factors affecting their psychological distress? Design A cross-sectional study conducted in an academic fertility centre. Online questionnaires were distributed between 18 April 2020 and 23 April 2020 to patients whose treatment cycle had been postponed or discontinued. The outcome measures included agreement with the reproductive society guidelines to postpone treatments; willingness to resume treatments, given the choice; patients’ emotional reactions; and psychological distress level, measured by the Mental Health Inventory validated scale. A multivariate linear regression was conducted to identify factors associated with psychological distress. Results Because of the small number of male respondents, only women were included in the analysis (n = 181). Forty-three per cent expressed disagreement with the guidelines and 82% were willing to resume treatments, given the choice. Sadness and anxiety were the most common emotional reactions expressed towards the guidelines. In the multivariate analysis, COVID-19-related anxiety (B = 0.145, P = 0.04) and disagreement with treatment suspension (B = –0.44, P = 0.001) were found to be significantly associated with patients' psychological distress. Background characteristics of patients did not contribute significantly to their distress. Conclusions Suspension of fertility treatment during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with patients' negative emotional reactions.

1004,Insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: an examination of biopsychosocial moderators,"Objective/background Healthy sleep is vital for physical and psychological health, and poor sleep can result in a myriad of negative physical and psychological outcomes. Insomnia symptoms often manifest as a result of acute life stressors or changes, and COVID-19 experiences may be one such stressor. Other known predisposing factors to insomnia may moderate the impact of COVID-19 experiences on sleep. The present study aimed to determine current levels of insomnia severity in a US sample, to investigate the relation of COVID-19 experiences to insomnia symptoms, and to determine which individuals are most susceptible to this association. Methods Data were drawn from a larger online survey investigating sleep and health outcomes across the lifespan. COVID-19 experiences were assessed with the exposure and impact subscales of the CAIR Pandemic Impact Questionnaire (C-PIQ). The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) measured insomnia symptoms. Biological, psychological, and social moderators were measured using other brief self-report measures. Results Insomnia symptoms prevalence was as follows: moderate-to-severe symptoms (25.5%), subthreshold symptoms (37.7%), and no symptoms (36.7%). Individuals’ COVID-19 experiences significantly predicted insomnia symptom severity [F(1,997) = 472.92, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.32]. This association was moderated by race, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, physical somatization, and social loneliness, but not age, gender, or education.

1007,Adolescents' Perceived Socio-Emotional Impact of COVID-19 and Implications for Mental Health: Results From a U.S.-Based Mixed-Methods Study,"Purpose COVID-19 has disrupted many aspects of adolescents' lives, yet little data are available that document their subjective experiences of the pandemic. In a mixed-methods study of U.S. adolescents, we examined (1) adolescents' perceptions of how their social and emotional lives had changed during COVID-19; and (2) associations between these perceived changes and indices of their mental health, above and beyond their prepandemic mental health status. Methods Four hundred seven U.S. adolescents (M age = 15.24, standard deviation = 1.69; 50% female; 52%, 20% African American, 17% Hispanic/Latinx) completed surveys before (October 2019) and during (April 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. They provided qualitative and quantitative responses on their experiences with COVID-19 and reports of their mental health. Results Adolescents perceived various changes in their relationships with family and friends (e.g., less perceived friend support) during COVID-19. They also perceived increases in negative affect and decreases in positive affect. These perceived social and emotional changes were associated with elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and loneliness in April 2020, controlling for mental health problems before the pandemic. Conclusions Our findings sensitize clinicians and scholars to the vulnerabilities (changes in friendship dynamics), as well as resiliencies (supportive family contexts), presented to U.S. adolescents during the early months of COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.039,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.039,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.039,2021-01-01,,,

1009,Medicaid prescription limits and their implications for naloxone accessibility,"Background Expanding access to and utilization of naloxone is a vitally important harm reduction strategy for preventing opioid overdose deaths, particularly in vulnerable populations like Medicaid beneficiaries. The objective of this study was to characterize the landscape of monthly prescription fill limit policies in Medicaid programs and their potential implications for expanding naloxone use for opioid overdose harm reduction. Methods A cross-sectional, multi-modal online and telephonic data collection strategy was used to identify and describe the presence and characteristics of monthly prescription fill limit policies across state Medicaid programs. Contextual characteristics were described regarding each state’s Medicaid enrollment, opioid prescribing rates, and overdose death rates. Data collection and analysis occurred between February and May 2020. Results Medicaid-covered naloxone fills are currently subject to monthly prescription fill limit policies in 10 state Medicaid programs, which cover 20 % of the Medicaid population nationwide. Seven of these programs are located in states ranking in the top 10 highest per-capita opioid prescribing rates in the country. However, 8 of these programs are located in states with opioid overdose death rates below the national average. Conclusions Medicaid beneficiaries at high risk of opioid overdose living in states with monthly prescription fill limits may experience significant barriers to obtaining naloxone. Exempting naloxone from Medicaid prescription limit restrictions may help spur broader adoption of naloxone for opioid overdose mortality prevention, especially in states with high opioid prescribing rates. Achieving unfettered naloxone coverage in Medicaid is critical as opioid overdoses and Medicaid enrollment increase amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108355,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108355,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108355,2021-01-01,,,

1012,"Disease, downturns, and wellbeing: Economic history and the long-run impacts of COVID-19","How might COVID-19 affect human capital and wellbeing in the long run? The COVID-19 pandemic has already imposed a heavy human cost—taken together, this public health crisis and its attendant economic downturn appear poised to dwarf the scope, scale, and disruptiveness of most modern pandemics. What evidence we do have about other modern pandemics is largely limited to short-run impacts. Consequently, recent experience can do little to help us anticipate and respond to COVID-19’s potential long-run impact on individuals over decades and even generations. History, however, offers a solution. Historical crises offer closer analogues to COVID-19 in each of its key dimensions—as a global pandemic, as a global recession—and offer the runway necessary to study the life-course and intergenerational outcomes. In this paper, we review the evidence on the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital of both historical pandemics (with a focus on the 1918 Influenza Pandemic) and historical recessions (with a focus on the Great Depression). We conclude by discussing how past crises can inform our approach to COVID-19—helping tell us what to look for, what to prepare for, and what data we ought to collect now.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eeh.2020.101381,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eeh.2020.101381,Scopus,10.1016/j.eeh.2020.101381,2021-01-01,,,

Método Estudio cualitativo exploratorio a través del análisis de ilustraciones realizadas por 71 escolares de 7-8 años de edad. El análisis se llevó a cabo según el marco teórico de Rose. Se realizó análisis descriptivo de los datos sociodemográficos. Resultados Del análisis del contenido emergieron cinco categorías: 1) sentimientos de tristeza y miedo; 2) importancia del núcleo familiar, seguridad y protección; 3) hábitos de vida sedentarios durante el confinamiento; 4) infraestructuras de las viviendas y desigualdades sociales (la vida tras una ventana); y 5) respuesta social, lucha colectiva y de los/las profesionales de la salud. Conclusiones La situación de pandemia de COVID-19 y las medidas estrictas de confinamiento han tenido un importante impacto en la población escolar, que es la que ha vivido las mayores restricciones. La infraestructura del hogar se ha mostrado como un claro diferenciador que ahonda en las desigualdades sociales y el impacto que la situación tiene en los/las escolares. Es necesario ampliar los estudios acerca del impacto psicosocial que esta situación va a tener a largo plazo en su salud física y mental. Objective To explore the experiences of schoolchildren in an exceptional health alert situation in which strict confinement measures have been applied to the population. Method Qualitative exploratory study through the analysis of illustrations carried out by schoolchildren aged 7 to 8. The analysis was carried out according to Rose's theoretical framework. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic data was performed. Results Five categories emerged from the analysis of the content: 1) feelings of sadness and fear; 2) importance of the family nucleus, safety and protection; 3) sedentary living habits during confinement; 4) housing infrastructure and social inequalities (life through a window); and 5) social response, collective struggle and through health professionals. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic situation and the strict confinement measures have had a significant impact on the school population, who had experienced the greatest restrictions.

1025,Pulmonary function and health-related quality of life after COVID-19 pneumonia,"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many cases of pneumonia with extensive lung abnormalities on CT-scans. The consequences of COVID-19 pneumonia on survivors’ pulmonary function and quality of life are unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 pneumonia on pulmonary function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived dyspnoea. Methods. A prospective longitudinal cohort study regarding patients discharged from our hospital after PCR-proven, non-critical COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. Cases were classified as moderate or severe pneumonia according to WHO definitions. Six weeks post-discharge subjects underwent interviews and pulmonary function tests, and completed questionnaires to assess their HRQoL, perceived dyspnoea (Borgscale and mMRC), and symptoms of depression and anxiety (HADS). Results. 101 patients were included. Twenty-eight (27.7%) pneumonias were classified as moderate cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and 73 (72.3%) were classified as severe cases. Diffusion limitation (DLCOc < 80% of predicted value) was found in 66 (71.7%) of 92 cases, obstruction in 26 (25.7%) of 101, and restriction in 21 (21.2%) of 99. Diffusion capacity was significantly lower in cases after severe pneumonia. In the entire group, HADS scores ≥8 for depression were found in 16.6% and in 12.5% for anxiety. Across all SF-36 domains, except for bodily pain, significant impairment was found. FEV1 and DLCOc showed significant positive correlations with mMRC scores and multiple SF-36 domains, especially physical functioning. Conclusion. COVID-19 non-critical pneumonia survivors have significant impairment in diffusion capacity and HRQOL six weeks after being discharged from hospital.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106272,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106272,Scopus,10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106272,2021-01-01,,,
1026,Infant feeding initiation practices in the context of COVID-19 lockdown,"Objective Limited information is available regarding barriers to breastfeeding during the COVID-19 lockdown. Study design This study was designed as a non-concurrent case-control study on breastfeeding initiation practices, defined according to WHO, in women giving birth during lockdown, between March 8 and May 18, 2020, in the COVID-19 ‘hotspot’ in Northeastern Italy (study group), with an antecedent puerperae-matched group (control group). Exclusive, complementary, and formula feeding practices were collected from maternal charts at hospital discharge, on the second day post-partum, when puerperae filled out the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results The COVID-19 study group presented significantly lower exclusive breastfeeding rates than the control group who members gave birth the previous year (−15%, p = 0.003), as a consequence of the significantly higher prevalence of complementary feeding practices in the former (+20%, p = 0.002). Conversely, the COVID-19 study group showed significantly higher EPDS scores (8.03 ± 4.88 vs. 8.03 ± 4.88, p < 0.005) and higher anhedonia (0.56 ± 0.65 vs. 0.18 ± 0.38, p < 0.001) and depression (0.62 ± 0.60 vs. 0.39 ± 0.44, <0.001) subscale scores. In the general linear model analysis, women practicing exclusive breastfeeding showed significantly lower EPDS scores in comparison with those practicing complementary (p = 0.003) and formula feedings (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the highest EPDS scores were observed in women adopting formula feeding, mainly during the COVID-19 quarantine (p = 0.019). Conclusion This study indicates that hospital containment measures adopted during lockdown in the ‘hotspot’ COVID-19 epidemic area of Northeastern Italy have a detrimental effect on maternal emotions and on breastfeeding exclusivity practices.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105286,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105286,Scopus,10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105286,2021-01-01,,,

1031,Psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on LGBT people in Chile,"Introduction COVID-19 pandemic has led many countries around the world, including Chile, to take various measures, including physical and, social isolation. The effects of these measures, necessary to prevent the virus from spreading, must be studied. In particular, quarantines are known to have an impact on quality of life and well-being (for example, associated symptoms such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and other psychosocial consequences). Furthermore, these effects are expected to be more pronounced in previously disadvantaged populations, such as LGBT people. This paper describes the main measures taken by LGBT population during quarantine to avoid COVID-19 and its psychosocial consequences on an individual and social basis. Method Non-probability sampling was used. An online self-administered survey including 1181 participants was used. These were lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender residents over 18 years old from Chile. Results Almost eight out of ten participants were in a total quarantine situation. From them, 18.2% were in partial isolation and only 4.6% were not in quarantine. COVID-19 has affected almost all the LGBT participants to a certain extent. COVID-19 has emotionally affected the vast majority of the LGBT participants to a certain extent. In other words, the pandemic has affected their lives. This psychosocial impact of COVID has been greater for people who define themselves as *sexual (include queer, asexual, pansexual, demisexual). Discussion The measures taken to prevent the virus transmission significantly affect LGBT people's life. In particular, these measures affect *sexual people. *sexual people must manage discrimination and misunderstanding of their identity in many contexts including their family.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2020.12.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2020.12.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.sexol.2020.12.006,2021-01-01,,,

1047,Mental Health Multimorbidity among Caregivers of Older Adults During the COVID-19 Epidemic,"Objective To investigate mental health status and associated factors among caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods From March 1 to 31, 2020, 916 caregivers of older adults participated in an online cross-sectional survey on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. The seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was administered to measure anxiety symptoms, the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to assess depressive symptoms, and a self-developed questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality and duration. Six questions about COVID-19-related experiences were used to assess community-level infection contact and the level of exposure to media information. The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression and sleep problems were computed. The Wald χ2 were applied to compare the differences between subgroups. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and multimorbidity. Results The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems were 46.8%, 29.8%, and 10.8%, respectively. Approximately 263 participants (28.7%) presented with two or more mental health problems. Being female (OR, 2.254; 95% CI, 1.510–3.363), having community-level COVID-19 contact (OR, 1.856; 95% CI, 1.189–2.898), and having a mental disorder (OR, 3.610; 95% CI, 1.644–7.930) were associated with increased risk of multimorbidity among caregivers. Caregivers who preferred positive information (OR, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.472–0.899) had reduced risk of multimorbidity. Conclusion Anxiety and depression were common among caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic. Being female and having community-level COVID-19 contact were independent risk factors for experiencing multiple mental health problems. Preexisting mental disorders increased the risk of multimorbidity among caregivers, while enhanced access to positive media information decreased the risk of multimorbidity.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2021.01.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2021.01.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2021.01.006,2021-01-01,,,

1052,"The role of psychological flexibility in the context of COVID-19: Associations with depression, anxiety, and insomnia","Evidence for detrimental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and well-being around the world is now accumulating. As it does a next step is to understand how such effects can be mitigated, such as by studying psychological capacities that may afford people immunity against these impacts. In this study, we explore psychological flexibility (PF) and grit as potential resilience factors in the context of COVID-19. Standardized measures of depression, anxiety, and insomnia as well as measures of PF (committed action and inflexibility) and grit (perseverance of effort and consistency of interest) were administered through a large scale national online survey (N = 1102; mean age 36,9 years; 75% women). As predicted, the results show both PF and grit to be negatively associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Further, regression models including relevant background variables and both sets of resilience factors showed that total variance accounted for in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was substantial, 50.5%, 49.5%, and 28.8%, respectively, with the PF components accounting for most of the explained variance in mental health. We conclude that PF and to a lesser extent grit may be important psychological resilience factors against mental health problems in the context of COVID-19. Our findings are practically important as they point to malleable public health targets during the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 and in the event of similar widespread health threats in the future.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.11.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.11.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.11.003,2021-01-01,,,

1055,Prevalence of depression during the COVID-19 outbreak: A meta-analysis of community-based studies,"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic, declared on March 11, 2020, constitute an extraordinary health, social and economic global challenge. The impact on people's mental health is expected to be high. This paper sought to systematically review community-based studies on depression conducted during the COVID-19 and estimate the pooled prevalence of depression. Method: We searched for cross-sectional, community-based studies listed on PubMed or Web of Science from January 1, 2020 to May 8, 2020 that reported prevalence of depression. A random effect model was used to estimate the pooled proportion of depression. Results: A total of 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis, with prevalence rates of depression ranging from 7.45% to 48.30%. The pooled prevalence of depression was 25% (95% CI: 18%−33%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I 2 =99.60%, p <.001). Conclusions: Compared with a global estimated prevalence of depression of 3.44% in 2017, our pooled prevalence of 25% appears to be 7 times higher, thus suggesting an important impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on people's mental health. Addressing mental health during and after this global health crisis should be placed into the international and national public health agenda to improve citizens’ wellbeing.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.07.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.07.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.07.007,2021-01-01,,,

We assessed prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors during the first wave of the pandemic among healthcare professionals in Spain. Methods All workers in 18 healthcare institutions (6 AACC) in Spain were invited to web-based surveys assessing individual characteristics, COVID-19 infection status and exposure, and mental health status (May 5 – September 7, 2020). We report: probable current mental disorders (Major Depressive Disorder-MDD- [PHQ-8≥10], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD- [GAD-7≥10], Panic attacks, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder –PTSD- [PCL-5≥7]; and Substance Use Disorder –SUD-[CAGE-AID≥2]. Severe disability assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale was used to identify probable “disabling” current mental disorders. Results 9,138 healthcare workers participated. Prevalence of screen-positive disorder: 28.1% MDD; 22.5% GAD, 24.0% Panic; 22.2% PTSD; and 6.2% SUD. Overall 45.7% presented any current and 14.5% any disabling current mental disorder. Workers with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders had almost twice the prevalence than those without. Adjusting for all other variables, odds of any disabling mental disorder were: prior lifetime disorders (TUS: OR=5.74; 95%CI 2.53-13.03; Mood: OR=3.23; 95%CI:2.27-4.60; Anxiety: OR=3.03; 95%CI:2.53-3.62); age category 18-29 years (OR=1.36; 95%CI:1.02-1.82), caring “all of the time” for COVID-19 patients (OR=5.19; 95%CI: 3.61-7.46), female gender (OR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.27-1.96) and having being in quarantine or isolated (OR= 1.60; 95CI:1.31-1.95). Conclusions One in seven Spanish healthcare workers screened positive for a disabling mental disorder during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Workers reporting pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders, those frequently exposed to COVID-19 patients, infected or quarantined/isolated, female workers, and auxiliary nurses should be considered groups in need of mental health monitoring and support.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.12.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.12.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.12.001,2021-01-01,,,

Background Cardiovascular comorbidities and complications, including right ventricular dysfunction, are common and are associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The data on the clinical usefulness of the 12-lead ECG to aid with prognosis are limited. Methods This study retrospectively evaluated records from 480 patients who were consecutively admitted with COVID-19. ECGs obtained at presentation in the emergency department (ED) were considered index ECGs. RHS-ECG was defined by any new right-axis deviation, S1Q3T3 pattern, or ST depressions with T-wave inversions in leads V1 to V3 or leads II, III, and aVF. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess whether RHS-ECGs were independently associated with primary outcomes. Results ECGs from the ED were available for 314 patients who were included in the analysis. Most patients were in sinus rhythm, with sinus tachycardia being the most frequent dysrhythmia. RHS-ECG findings were present in 40 (11%) patients. RHS-ECGs were significantly associated with the incidence of adverse outcomes and an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR]: 15.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.1 to 45.2; p < 0.001), the need for mechanical ventilation (adjOR: 8.8; 95% CI: 3.4 to 23.2; p < 0.001), and their composite (adjOR: 12.1; 95% CI: 4.3 to 33.9]; p < 0.001).

1071,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health in Spain: Positive and negative outcomes,"Background Previous studies have shown that perinatal distress has a negative influence on pregnancy outcome and the physiological development of the baby. Objective The aim of this study was to describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal perinatal mental health in Spain. Methods Seven hundred and twenty-four women (N=450 pregnancy, N=274 postpartum) were recruited online during the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were administered. Variables related to sociodemographic information, the COVID-19 pandemic, and perinatal care were also assessed. Findings The results showed that 58% of women reported depressive symptoms. Moreover, 51% of women reported anxiety symptoms. On the other hand, a regression analysis for life satisfaction showed that besides the perception about their own health, marital status or being a health practitioner were also significant predictors during pregnancy. However, perception about baby’s health and sleep, perception about their own health, and marital status were significant predictors of life satisfaction during the postpartum stage.

1075,Job Insecurity and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among U.S. Young Adults During COVID-19,"Purpose This study aimed to estimate the associations between job insecurity and symptoms of anxiety and depression among U.S. young adults amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We analyzed data on young adults aged 18–26 years from June 15 to June 30, 2020, from the weekly, cross-sectional Household Pulse Survey (n = 4,852) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Two job insecurity measures and four anxiety and depression measures were analyzed using multivariable Poisson regression models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. Results Fifty-nine percent of participants experienced direct or household employment loss since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 38% were expected to experience direct or household employment loss in the coming 4 weeks. Recent direct or household employment loss and expected direct or household employment loss, among participants who did not experience recent employment loss, were associated with a greater risk of poor mental health on all four measures. Conclusions U.S. young adults experience a significant mental health burden as a result of job insecurity amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.008,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.008,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.008,2021-01-01,,,

1096,"An insight into the mental health needs of the common public of Tamil Nadu, India, subjected to COVID-19 lockdown, a rare unprecedented crisis","Purpose COVID-19, a major “Public Health Emergencies of International Concern”, had sought greater attention among researchers to study its pathogenesis, associated complications and management. However, there are only few studies that had studied its potential impact on mental health of general public, who are subjected to social distancing, community lockdown and restrictions in their routine activities. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and mental health needs among general public in Tamil Nadu subjected to lockdown, social distancing amidst COVID-19 crisis. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected states of southern India. Methods A self-administered, web-based application study using “WHO-Self Reported Questionnaire-20”, in bilingual version, both English and Tamil, is used to screen the public for the level of distress. The study is done while the state is under extended lockdown and restricted movement. Key findings A total of 918 respondents participated in the survey and it is found that about more than one third of the respondents (∼35%) are under psychological distress. A significant association between younger age group, female gender, unmarried, people with children are found to be under distress. The lockdown had increased the frequency of smoking and quantity of cigarettes among smokers, also has increased the frequency of drinking among alcohol consumers. Of the SRQ-20 items recorded, stress related neurotic symptoms (>70%) was observed more than the depressive mood. About 33% of those scored>7, had suicidal tendency. The districts declared red zones had significantly reported a greater number of respondents under distress. Conclusion Besides effectively mitigating the COVID-19 crisis, in terms of prevention, control and treatment strategies, it is prerogative to effectively manage fear, distress due to the COVID-19 and associated anxiety and depression among the public.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.013,2021-01-01,,,

Adapting to a “new normal” continues to be an unsettling experience for many of us. For individuals with chronic pain, adaptation is familiar. In this study we turn to their experience to better understand what resilience can look like in the setting of major life changes. Participants were recruited from an outpatient pain management clinic from mid-March through June 2020 and completed measures assessing resilience, chronic pain acceptance, and an open-ended question examining the impact of chronic pain on their experience during COVID-19. Qualitative and quantitative analyses identified themes of acceptance and resilience. Furthermore, baseline depression was found to be associated with less cognitive/affective positivity (an aspect of resilience) and less pain willingness (an aspect of acceptance). In this brief snapshot of the chronic pain experience, we are reminded of the invaluable lessons learned from our patients. They offer us a model of resilience from which we can foster our own overall wellbeing in the context of continued stress and disruption.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.10.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.10.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.10.010,2021-01-01,,,

This proportion of cuts and omissions is three to five times higher than any other quarter since 2015. The 2008 financial crisis was characterized by a high proportion of financial firms cutting dividends without much change in dividends for non-financials. Conversely, we find evidence of increased dividend cuts across all industries. The most common industry grouping, industrials, experienced one out of every six firms cutting dividends. Regression results indicate that net income and debt are determinants of firms cutting dividends in all periods, but the economic significance is much greater during the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2020.101910,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2020.101910,Scopus,10.1016/j.frl.2020.101910,2021-01-01,,,

1111,Effect of COVID-19 confinement on the mental status of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,"Antecedentes y objetivo Las pacientes con lupus eritematoso sistémico (LES) son más vulnerables a presentar mayores niveles de estrés y síntomas psicopatológicos que la población general sana, por lo que el brote de la COVID-19 podría alterar su estado psicológico. El objetivo fue analizar el impacto psicológico de la pandemia y del confinamiento sobre los niveles de estrés y sintomatología psicopatológica en pacientes con LES. Pacientes y método En este estudio transversal se compararon niveles de estrés mediante la Escala de Estrés Percibido y el Inventario de Vulnerabilidad al Estrés, y síntomas psicopatológicos mediante el Inventario de síntomas SCL-90-R, en pacientes con LES durante el período de confinamiento (grupo 1; n=276) con respecto a pacientes con LES evaluadas en un período anterior a la pandemia (grupo 2; n=152). Resultados La comparación entre ambos grupos mostró que existían diferencias estadísticamente significativas en vulnerabilidad al estrés (p<0,0001), depresión (p≤0,05), ansiedad (p≤0,05), ansiedad fóbica (p<0,0001), sensibilidad interpersonal (p≤0,043), y psicoticismo (p≤0,023). En estas variables el grupo de pacientes con lupus en confinamiento obtuvo puntuaciones superiores. Conclusiones El confinamiento y la amenaza del brote por COVID-19 ha tenido importantes repercusiones en el estado psicológico de las pacientes con LES, mostrando altos niveles de estrés, ansiedad y depresión. Estos hallazgos muestran su vulnerabilidad ante una alerta de salud pública, y señala la necesidad de realizar un abordaje psicológico de estas pacientes mientras dure el estado de emergencia sanitaria, así como ante posibles rebrotes del virus. Background and objective Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are more vulnerable to higher levels of stress and psychopathological symptoms than the general healthy population. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. Patients and method In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n=276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n=152). Results The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (P <.0001), depression (P ≤.05), anxiety (P ≤.05), phobic anxiety (P <.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (P ≤.043), and psychoticism (P ≤.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. Conclusions The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings show their vulnerability to a public health alert and indicate the need to carry out a psychological approach to these patients while the state of health emergency lasts as well as to possible outbreaks of the virus.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004,2021-01-01,,,

1125,Gender as a moderator between Present-Hedonistic time perspective and depressive symptoms or stress during COVID-19 lock-down,"Although numerous studies have addressed the impact of the COVID-19 lock-downs on psychological distress, scarce data is available relating to the role of Present-Hedonistic (PH) time perspective and gender differences in the development of depressive symptoms and stress during the period of strict social distancing. We hypothesized that gender would moderate the relationship between PH and depressiveness or stress levels, such that PH would negatively correlate with psychological distress in women but correlate positively in men. The present study was online and questionnaire-based. N = 230 participants aged 15–73 from the general population took part in the study. The results of moderation analysis allowed for full acceptance of the hypothesis for depression as a factor, but for stress the hypothesis was only partially confirmed, since the relationship between PH time perspective and stress was not significant for men (although it was positive, as expected). The findings are pioneering in terms of including PH time perspective in predicting psychological distress during the COVID-19 lock-down and have potentially significant implications for practicing clinicians, who could include the development of more adaptive time perspectives and balance them in their therapeutic work with people experiencing lock-down-related distress.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110395,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110395,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2020.110395,2021-01-01,,,

1132,"Trajectories of eating behavior during COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal analyses of 22,374 adults","Background & aims The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of stay-at-home and lockdown measures. It is currently unknown if the experience of lockdown leads to long term changes in individual's eating behaviors. The objectives of this study were: i) to derive longitudinal trajectories of change in eating during UK lockdown, and ii) to identify risk factors associated with eating behavior trajectories. Method Data from 22,374 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social study (a panel study collecting weekly data during the pandemic) were analyzed from 28th March to 29th May 2020. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to derive trajectories of change in eating. These were then associated with prior socio-economic, health-related and psychological factors using multinomial regression models. Results Analyses suggested five trajectories, with the majority (64%) showing no change in eating. In contrast, one trajectory was marked by persistently eating more, whereas another by persistently eating less. Overall, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report any change in eating. Loneliness was linked to persistently eating more (OR = 1.07), whereas being single or divorced, as well as stressful life events, were associated with consistently eating less (OR = 1.69). Overall, higher education status was linked to lower odds of changing eating behavior (OR = 0.54–0.77). Secondary exploratory analyses suggest that participants self-reported to have overweight were more commonly categorised into the group consistently eating more, whereas participants with underweigh persistently ate less. Conclusion In this study, we found that one third of the sample report changes in quantities eaten throughout the first UK lockdown period. Findings highlight the importance of adjusting public health programs to support eating behaviors in future lockdowns both in this and potential future pandemics. This is particularly important as part of on-going preventive efforts to prevent nutrition-related chronic diseases.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.046,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.046,Scopus,10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.046,2021-01-01,,,

1136,The assessment of lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic using a multidimensional scale,"Introduction Healthy lifestyles are relevant to several diseases and to maintain individuals’ mental health. Exposure to epidemics and confinement have been consistently associated with psychological consequences, but changes on lifestyle behaviours remain under-researched. Materials and Methods An online survey was conducted among the general population living in Spain during the COVID-19 home-isolation. In addition to demographic and clinical data, participants self-reported changes in seven lifestyle domains. The Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation was developed specifically to evaluate changes during the confinement (SMILE-C). Results A total of 1254 individuals completed the survey over the first week of data collection. The internal consistency of the SMILE-C to assess lifestyles during confinement was shown (Cronbach's Alpha=0.747). Most participants reported substantial changes on outdoor time (93.6%) and physical activity (70.2%). Moreover, about one third of subjects reported significant changes on stress management, social support, and restorative sleep. Several demographic and clinical factors were associated to lifestyle scores. In the multivariate model, those independently associated with a healthier lifestyle included substantial changes on stress management (p <0.001), social support (p =0.001) and outdoor time (p <0.001), amongst others. In contrast, being an essential worker (p =0.001), worse self-rated health (p <0.001), a positive screening for depression/anxiety (p <0.001), and substantial changes on diet/nutrition (p <0.001) and sleep (p <0.001) were all associated with poorer lifestyles. Conclusions In this study, sizable proportions of participants reported meaningful changes in lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. Moreover, the SMILE-C was sensitive to detect these changes and presented good initial psychometric properties. Further follow-up studies should collect relevant data to promote healthy lifestyles in pandemic times.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.07.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.07.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.07.003,2021-01-01,,,

1141,Mental health problems among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19: The importance of nutrition and physical activity,"Background/Objective Mental health problems are common among adolescents and greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence and correlates of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19. Method: Cross-sectional study (N = 1,794 adolescents, mean age = 15.26) was conducted in May 2020. An online survey was used to collect socio-demographic data, COVID-related fear (COVID-fear), nutrition, physical activity (PA) level and the symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms was 37.80%, 48.20% and 36.70%, respectively, among Chinese adolescents during the pandemic. Generalized linear models revealed that female, left behind children, and students with greater COVID-fear tended to report symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety concurrently. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and COVID-fear, better nutritional status and moderately active PA were both associated with lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, while highly active PA was associated with lower levels of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19. To promote adolescents’ mental health, educators should help adolescents develop a healthy lifestyle with balanced diet and regular exercise.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.100218,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.100218,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.100218,2021-01-01,,,

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of self-reported mental health parameters and the coping mechanisms of employees and students in a Saudi State University. Methods An online survey in both Arabic and English was launched targeting students, staff and faculty of King Saud University from May 11 to June 6, 2020, the peak of Saudi Arabia’s nationwide lockdown. A total of 1542 respondents (726 males and 816 females) aged 20–65 years old participated. Results Majority of the respondents claimed to have suffered from anxiety (58.1%), depression (50.2%) and insomnia (32.2%) during the lockdown. On average, 65.3% respondents agreed that family bond strengthened during lockdown. Those in the highest quartile of family bonding score (Q4) were 41% [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.59 (0.39–0.87), p < 0.001] and 59% [OR 0.41 (CI 0.27–0.64), p < 0.001] were less likely to be anxious and depressed, respectively, even after adjusting for covariates. This independent and significant inverse association was more apparent in females than males. Conclusion Self-reported acute mental health disorders were common within the academic community during the COVID-19 lockdown.

1156,Sleeping when the world locks down: Correlates of sleep health during the COVID-19 pandemic across 59 countries,"Objectives COVID-19 escalated into a global pandemic affecting countries around the world. As communities shut down to reduce disease spread, all aspects of life have been altered, including sleep. This study investigated changes in sleep patterns and correlates of sleep health in a global sample and examined relationships between sleep health and psychological distress. Design Cross-sectional. Settings Online survey distributed between April 19 and May 3, 2020. Participants Total 6882 participants (18-94 years) across 59 countries. Measurements Sleep health (RU-SATED), demographics, pandemic-related factors, mood. Results More than half the sample shifted their sleep toward later bed- and wake-times, and more than a third reported increased sleep disturbances during the pandemic. Older age, being partnered, and living in a higher income country were associated with better sleep health, while a stricter level of quarantine and pandemic-related factors (being laid off from job, financial strain, or difficulties transitioning to working from home) were associated with poorer sleep health. Domestic conflict was the strongest correlate of poorer sleep health. Poorer sleep health was strongly associated with greater depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants from Latin America reported the lowest sleep health scores. Conclusions COVID-19-associated factors have impacted sleep health on a global level. While our data are correlational, sleep health is strongly linked with mental health and could play a protective role against developing mental distress during pandemic-related isolation.

1159,"Prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and psychological distress among populations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Objective We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and Psychological distress (PD) related to COVID-19 among affected populations. Methods We searched articles in Medline, Embase, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. Random-effects meta-analyses on the proportions of individuals with symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and PD were generated and between-group differences for gender, healthcare workers (HCWs), and regions where studies were conducted. Results A total of 2189 articles were screened, 136 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Fifty-five peer-reviewed studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis (N=189,159). The prevalence of depression (k=46) was 15.97% (95%CI, 13.24-19.13). The prevalence of anxiety (k=54) was 15.15% (95%CI, 12.29-18.54). The prevalence of insomnia (k=14) was 23.87% (95%CI, 15.74-34.48). The prevalence of PTSD (k=13) was 21.94% (95%CI, 9.37-43.31). Finally, the prevalence of psychological distress (k=19) was 13.29% (95%CI, 8.80-19.57).

1172,Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN),"A major driver of the U.S. opioid crisis is limited access to effective medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) that reduce overdose risks. Traditionally, jails and prisons in the U.S. have not initiated or maintained MOUD for incarcerated individuals with OUD prior to their return to the community, which places them at high risk for fatal overdose. A 2018 law (Chapter 208) made Massachusetts (MA) the first state to mandate that five county jails deliver all FDA-approved MOUDs (naltrexone [NTX], buprenorphine [BUP], and methadone). Chapter 208 established a 4-year pilot program to expand access to all FDA-approved forms of MOUD at five jails, with two more MA jails voluntarily joining this initiative. The law stipulates that MOUD be continued for individuals receiving it prior to detention and be initiated prior to release among sentenced individuals where appropriate. The jails must also facilitate continuation of MOUD in the community on release. The Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN) partnered with these seven diverse jails, the MA Department of Public Health, and community treatment providers to conduct a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of Chapter 208. We will: (1) Perform a longitudinal treatment outcome study among incarcerated individuals with OUD who receive NTX, BUP, methadone, or no MOUD in jail to examine postrelease MOUD initiation, engagement, and retention, as well as fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose and recidivism; (2) Conduct an implementation study to understand systemic and contextual factors that facilitate and impede delivery of MOUDs in jail and community care coordination, and strategies that optimize MOUD delivery in jail and for coordinating care with community partners; (3) Calculate the cost to the correctional system of implementing MOUD in jail, and conduct an economic evaluation from state policy-maker and societal perspectives to compare the value of MOUD prior to release from jail to no MOUD among matched controls. MassJCOIN made significant progress during its first six months until the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. Participating jail sites restricted access for nonessential personnel, established other COVID-19 mitigation policies, and modified MOUD programming. MassJCOIN adapted research activities to this new reality in an effort to document and account for the impacts of COVID-19 in relation to each aim. The goal remains to produce findings with direct implications for policy and practice for OUD in criminal justice settings.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108275,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108275,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108275,2021-01-01,,,

Thus, pregnancy may be a risk factor that could deepen the already negative effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze longitudinally the psychopathological consequences of the pandemic in pregnant women, and to explore differences with non-pregnant women. The participants in this study were 102 pregnant women, and a control group of 102 non-pregnant women (most of them reported having university studies and little financial impact from the pandemic). They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, in three different times (2, 14, and 47 days after the start of the lockdown). In a time range of 50 days of quarantine, all women showed a gradual increase in psychopathological indicators and a decrease in positive affect. Pregnant women showed a more pronounced increase in depression, anxiety and negative affect than the non-pregnant women did. In addition, pregnant women showed a more pronounced decrease in positive affect.

1185,Brief Transdiagnostic Intervention for Parents With Emotional Disorder Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Example,"Concerns regarding parent mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic are justifiably on the rise. Although anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress levels have risen precipitously across all demographics during the pandemic, parents residing with their children are under particular and unique strain. Caregivers with children in the home are responsible not only for their own health, financial security, and safety during this time, but often full-time caregiving, household management and, in many cases, their children’s schooling. In this case paper, we describe the development of the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders for Caregivers (UP-Caregiver) and provide a case example of its implementation. This 4-session indicated prevention for caregivers is a modification of existing versions of the Unified Protocols for adults and children, modified to maximize its responsiveness to issues faced by parents and caregivers living with youth (ages 6–13) during the current pandemic. UP-Caregiver was offered as part of a randomized, controlled trial via telehealth in a small group format to any parent with a child in the specified age range with mild or greater anxiety, depression or traumatic stress symptoms during an initial screening. The case example provided is of a White, Hispanic mother with a range of self-reported emotional disorder concerns at an initial assessment. Declines in anxiety, depression and traumatic stress symptoms were all noted, as well as improvements in parenting self-efficacy and distress tolerance 6-weeks after initiating UP-Caregiver. An ongoing randomized, controlled trial of UP-Caregiver will further evaluate the utility and feasibility of this approach to alleviate parental distress during COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.01.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.01.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.01.002,2021-01-01,,,

1191,How do state policies shape experiences of household income shocks and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The tremendous job loss and wage cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns about the mental health of the population. The impacts of income shocks on mental health may differ across U.S. states during the pandemic, as states have different policy contexts that likely influence mental health. The present study uses survey data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey (April–July 2020) to examine whether mental health outcomes vary across U.S. states and to what extent specific state-level contexts moderate the associations between household income shocks and depression (n = 582,440) and anxiety (n = 582,796). We find that the prevalence of depression and anxiety differs across states by household income shock status. For individuals, living in a state with supportive social policies – primarily those related to Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and suspended utility shut offs during the pandemic – weakens the association between household income shocks and mental health. Findings suggest that the lack of a strong federal response to the pandemic alongside the devolution of federal power to states over the past 40 years contributes to inequalities in mental health across states. We provide insight about how specific existing and emergency-related policies can reduce adverse mental health consequences of household income shocks.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113557,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113557,Scopus,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113557,2021-01-01,,,
1192,"Cross-cultural comparisons of psychosocial distress in the USA, South Korea, France, and Hong Kong during the initial phase of COVID-19","The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in disruption of everyday life worldwide but the impact and response to the pandemic have not been uniform. Many countries rapidly deployed physical-distancing mandates to curb the spread of the virus; others did not. Social distancing strategies are necessary to reduce the transmission of the virus but there may be unintended consequences. We examined psychological distress in four societies with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental health outcome during the pandemic. From March to July of 2020, a survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and more severe loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome but the magnitudes of these effects varied across the four regions. Objective measures of social isolation did not affect mental health. There were also notable differences in psychological outcome; Hong Kong, with very strict social distancing protocols plus ongoing political unrest, suffered the most drastic deterioration of mental health. To prepare for an impending mental health crisis, concerted efforts to reduce loneliness should be integrated into a comprehensive public health strategy.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113593,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113593,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113593,2021-01-01,,,

1194,Mental health outcomes of coronavirus infection survivors: A rapid meta-analysis,"Background The current COVID pandemic is happening while the long-term effects of coronavirus infection remain poorly understood. The present article meta-analyzed mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, etc.) from a previous coronavirus outbreak in China (2002). Method CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, and Google Scholar were searched up to early June 2020 for articles in English or Chinese reporting mental illness symptoms of SARS patients. Main outcome measures include SCL-90, SAS, SDS, and IES-R scales. 29 papers met the inclusion criteria. The longest follow-up time included in the analysis was 46 months. Findings The systematic meta-analysis indicated that mental health problems were most serious before or at hospital discharge and declined significantly during the first 12 months after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, average symptom levels remained above healthy norms even at 12 months and continued to improve, albeit slowly, thereafter. Interpretation The adverse mental health impact of being hospitalized with coronavirus infection long outlasts the physical illness. Mental health issues were the most serious for coronavirus infected patients before (including) hospital discharge and improved continuously during the first 12 months after hospital discharge. If COVID-19 infected patients follow a similar course of mental health development, most patients should recover to normal after 12 months of hospital discharge.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.015,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.015,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.015,2021-01-01,,,

1205,"The first psychiatric pandemic: Encephalitis lethargica, 1917–27","Finding a link between COVID-19 and subsequent psychiatric symptoms has resulted in renewed interest in the psychiatric sequelae of pandemics. The first such instance was apparently the encephalitis lethargica pandemic which arose around the time of the First World War, moving in the shadow of a repiratory virus pandemic. The epidemic of encephalitis lethargica (EL), or Von Economo’s Disease, in the years 1917–27 was the first pandemic involving the central nervous system. It moved in some places in parallel with the Great Flu Pandemic but does not seem to have been caused by it. Unlike the coronavirus, pandemic EL affected children heavily, leading often to bizarre changes in character and personality. It often left sequelae lasting for decades in the form of postencephalitic Parkinsonism (PEP). Unlike the coronavirus, it had a high mortality of around 20 percent. Although encephalitis lethargica involved a number of systems, psychiatric morbidity was most prominent and entailed severe depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It ended without therapeutic or public-health measures; today, sporadic cases of EL continue to be reported. The hypothesis is that we can derive from the EL psychiatric pandemic certain lessons that might be useful in studying tardive COVID symptoms today.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110420,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110420,Scopus,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110420,2021-01-01,,,

1219,Perceived social support and prenatal wellbeing; The mediating effects of loneliness and repetitive negative thinking on anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Problem Prenatal depression and anxiety are linked to poor maternal and infant outcomes. We need to understand predictors of poor mental health to identify at-risk women, and targets for support. Background Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between low levels of perceived social support, and depression and anxiety in pregnant women. However, there is a lack of research into the factors that may mediate this relationship. Aim As social distancing measures (e.g., lockdown) are likely to negatively affect women’s perceived support in the prenatal period, we investigated the relationship between perceived social support and both anxiety and depression in UK-based pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we examined two potential mediators that may contribute to psychological symptoms: repetitive negative thinking and loneliness. Methods We administered a battery of online measures to a sample of pregnant women (N =205) between May-June 2020, during the first peak of the pandemic in the UK, when perceived social support was likely to be low. Results Consistent with predictions, perceived social support was significantly negatively related to depression, anxiety, loneliness and repetitive negative thinking. Furthermore, repetitive negative thinking and loneliness mediated the relationship between perceived social support and both depression and anxiety. Moreover, perceived social support and loneliness were associated with specific types of online behaviours. Conclusions Taken together, the findings shed light on the processes through which social support may exert its effects on depression and anxiety and highlight potential therapeutic targets for interventions which aim to prevent and treat mood disorders in perinatal cohorts.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.12.014,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.12.014,Scopus,10.1016/j.wombi.2020.12.014,2021-01-01,,,
1220,"Levels of resilience, anxiety and depression in nurses working in respiratory clinical areas during the COVID pandemic","Background The delivery of healthcare during the COVID pandemic has had a significant impact on front line staff. Nurses who work with respiratory patients have been at the forefront of the pandemic response. Lessons can be learnt from these nurses’ experiences in order to support these nurses during the existing pandemic and retain and mobilise this skilled workforce for future pandemics. Methods This study explores UK nurses’ experiences of working in a respiratory environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. An e-survey was distributed via professional respiratory societies; the survey included a resilience scale, the GAD7 (anxiety) and the PHQ9 (depression) tools. Demographic data was collected on age, gender, ethnicity, nursing experience and background, clinical role in the pandemic, and home-life and work balance. Results Two hundred and fifty-five responses were received for the survey, predominately women (89%, 226/255), aged over 35 (79%, 202/255). Nearly 21% (40/191) experiencing moderate to severe or severe symptoms of anxiety. Similar levels are seen for depression (17.2%, 31/181). 18.9% (34/180) had a low or very low resilience score. Regression analysis showed that for both depression and anxiety variables, age and years of qualification provided the best model fit. Younger nurses with less experience have higher levels of anxiety and depression and had lower resilience. Conclusion This cohort experienced significant levels of anxiety and depression, with moderate to high levels of resilience. Support mechanisms and interventions need to be put in place to support all nurses during pandemic outbreaks, particularly younger or less experienced staff.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106219,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106219,Scopus,10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106219,2021-01-01,,,

1228,Strategic inefficiencies and federal redistribution during uncoordinated response to pandemic waves,"Optimal policy during an epidemic calls for depressed economic activity to slow down the outbreak. Sometimes, these decisions are left to local authorities (e.g. states). This creates an externality, as the outbreak does not respect states’ boundaries. The externality directly exacerbates the outbreak. Indirectly, it creates a free-rider problem, because local policymakers pass the cost of fighting the outbreak on to other states. A standard system of distortionary taxes and lump-sum transfers can implement the optimal allocation, with higher tax rates required if states behave strategically. A strategic system of taxes and transfers, rewarding states which depress their economies more than average, improves the outcomes by creating a race-to-the-bottom type of response. In a symmetric equilibrium, the optimal tax rate is lower if states behave strategically.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102003,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102003,2021-01-01,,,
1229,Challenges and pitfalls in anesthesia for electroconvulsive therapy,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) refers to the application of electricity to the patients’ scalp to treat psychiatric disorders, most notably, treatment-resistant depression. It is a safe, effective, and evidence-based therapy that is performed with general anesthesia. Muscle relaxation is used to prevent injuries related to the tonic–clonic seizure caused by ECT. Hypnotics are administered to induce amnesia and unconsciousness, so that, patients do not experience the period of muscle relaxation, while the generalized seizure is left unnoticed. For the anesthesiologist, ECT is associated with the challenges and pitfalls that are related to informed consent, social acceptance of ECT, airway management (especially in COVID-19 patients), and the interaction between ventilation and anesthetics from one viewpoint, and seizure induction and maintenance from another. The exact mode of action of the therapy is as unknown as the optimal choice or combination of anesthetics used.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpa.2020.12.012,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpa.2020.12.012,Scopus,10.1016/j.bpa.2020.12.012,2021-01-01,,,

Method: Information was collected from 595 confined participants who reported personal and contextual information, depressive symptoms and PA levels at four time points. Results: The changes in depressive symptoms were analyzed using a linear mixed model with cubic splines. Results showed a significant increase, with a significant rise between T1 and T2 (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.83-3.10). It continued growing until T4 (OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.97-4.38). A negative relationship was observed between the increase in depressive symptoms and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels, with a significant slope up to 4 hours of MVPA per week (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.29-0.90) that tended to increase until 16 hours per week of MVPA (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20-0.87).

Design and methods: 94 parents of adolescents (11–18 years old, M = 13.90, SD = 1.85) participated at different times during the state of alert in Spain. 91.5% were mothers. Their ages ranged from 35 to 63 years (M = 46.54; SD = 5.09). The variables assessed were anxiety, depression and stress (DASS), moods (MOOD), somatization (SCL) and resilience (CD-RISC). Descriptive analyses, t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations, and hierarchical regressions were performed. All this by means of a cross-sectional and longitudinal study design. Results: at the beginning of the confinement parents showed low levels of emotional distress and moderate levels of positive emotionality and resilience. However, those with a prior psychological problem, who had lost their job, or had lost someone to the pandemic, showed worse emotional adjustment. Resilience was relevant in predicting anxiety-depressive symptoms, and a low level of happiness was relevant in predicting stress. Emotional symptoms improved over time, and resilience remained stable. Conclusions: the emotional impact of COVID over time is influenced by mood, mental health, and resilience. In addition, parents who had a previous health problem, had lost their job or a loved one, had a worse adjustment. Practical implications: it is important to carry out intervention programs that increase resilience, treating parents who require it, since their emotional adjustment has repercussions on the emotional adjustment of family system.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.01.028,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.01.028,Scopus,10.1016/j.pedn.2021.01.028,2021-01-01,,,

1281,Coronavirus infection and PARP expression dysregulate the NAD metabolome: An actionable component of innate immunity,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) superfamily members covalently link either a single ADP-ribose (ADPR) or a chain of ADPR units to proteins using NAD as the source of ADPR. Although the well-known poly(ADP-ribosylating) (PARylating) PARPs primarily function in the DNA damage response, many noncanonical mono(ADP-ribosylating) (MARylating) PARPs are associated with cellular antiviral responses. We recently demonstrated robust up-regulation of several PARPs following infection with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly up-regulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while down-regulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+. Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM, and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV that is sensitive to PARP activity. These data suggest that the antiviral activities of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are limited by the availability of NAD and that nutritional and pharmacological interventions to enhance NAD levels may boost innate immunity to coronaviruses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA120.015138,https://www.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA120.015138,Scopus,10.1074/jbc.RA120.015138,2020-12-25,,,

1303,Outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 3377 patients,"Outcomes for patients with hematologic malignancy infected with COVID-19 have not been aggregated. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the risk of death and other important outcomes for these patients. We searched PubMed and EMBASE up to 20 August 2020 to identify reports of patients with hematologic malignancy and COVID-19. The primary outcome was a pooled mortality estimate, considering all patients and only hospitalized patients. Secondary outcomes included risk of intensive care unit admission and ventilation in hospitalized patients. Subgroup analyses included mortality stratified by age, treatment status, and malignancy subtype. Pooled prevalence, risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Thirty-four adult and 5 pediatric studies (3377 patients) from Asia, Europe, and North America were included (14 of 34 adult studies included only hospitalized patients). Risk of death among adult patients was 34% (95% CI, 28-39; N = 3240) in this sample of predominantly hospitalized patients. Patients aged ≥60 years had a significantly higher risk of death than patients <60 years (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.45-2.27; N = 1169). The risk of death in pediatric patients was 4% (95% CI, 1-9; N = 102). RR of death comparing patients with recent systemic anticancer therapy to no treatment was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.83-1.64; N = 736).

1313,Can selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a neuroprotective effect during COVID-19?,"The absence of a specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection led to an intense global effort in order to find new therapeutic interventions and improve patient outcomes. One important feature of COVID-19 pathophysiology is the activation of immune cells, with consequent massive production and release of inflammatory mediators that may cause impairment of several organ functions, including the brain. In addition to its classical role as a neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has immunomodulatory properties, downregulating the inflammatory response by central and peripheral mechanisms. In this review, we describe the roles of 5-HT in the regulation of systemic inflammation and the potential benefits of the use of specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a coadjutant therapy to attenuate neurological complications of COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173629,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173629,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173629,2020-12-15,,,

Many countries are frantically responding with staggering financial stimulus recovery initiatives. This opinion-paper reviews challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for the post-COVID-19 era that focuses on intensive sustaining of agri-food supply chain in tandem with meeting the high demand for new green deal innovation. For example, the development of wet peatland innovation, known as Paludiculture, can intensively sustain and blend agri-food and green innovations that will help support COVID-19 pandemic transitioning. The future looks bright for the creation of new sustainability multi-actor innovation hubs that will support, connect, and enable businesses to recover and pivot beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The nexus between first ‘Green Deal’ initiative supporting 64 selected European Startups and SMEs (European Innovation Council) and 43 Irish Disruptive Technology projects are addressed in the context of cross-cutting developments and relevance to COVID-19.

1322,Growth years and post-harvest processing methods have critical roles on the contents of medicinal active ingredients of Scutellaria baicalensis,"Optimizing the processing technology is an effective way to improve the yield of active ingredients for the industrial production of medicinal crops. Baikal Skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) is a perennial herb in the Lamiaceae family and its dried root is used as a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Modern pharmacological studies have shown that the active ingredients of S. baicalensis have important pharmacological effects including anti-oxidation, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammation. Specifically, it is recently found that S. baicalensis has significant curative effects on the treatment of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In recent years, the market demand for the medicinal products of S. baicalensis is increasing because of its great medicinal values. However, the annual yield of active ingredients originated from the root of S. baicalensis is limited due to that little progress has been made on the traditional processing technology used in the extraction process. A pressing issue faced by both herbalists and scientists is how to improve the processing efficiency, thereby obtaining the maximum yield of products for S. baicalensis. In this study, a systematic analysis on the effects of growth years and post-harvest processing on the contents of medicinal active ingredients of S. baicalensis was conducted. The contents of eight active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, scutellarin, scutellarein, apigenin, and chrysin) in roots of S. baicalensis of different growth years (ranging from 1 year to 15 years) were estimated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and further analyzed to determine the optimal harvest period. In particular, the contents of six active ingredients in different parts (cortex and stele) of the root of S. baicalensis were estimated and compared. Meanwhile, the dynamic changes of the contents of active ingredients in fresh-crush and fresh-cut roots of S. baicalensis at room temperature were compared and analyzed to reveal the influence of post-harvest treatment on the contents of active ingredients. In addition, the effects of six different post-harvest treatments on the contents of active ingredients were systematically designed and compared to determine the best primary processing technology. The results showed that the best harvesting period for S. baicalensis should be determined as 2–3 years based on comprehensive evaluation of active ingredient content, annual yield increment, and land use efficiency. The contents of active ingredients including baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin in cortex were significantly higher than those in stele (P ≤ 0.05). The contents of baicalin, wogonoside, and scutellarin in fresh roots of S. baicalensis significantly reduced as the storage time increased, but the reduction of fresh-cutting was significantly lower than that of fresh-crushing. For the effects of different processing treatments, the contents of four main active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin) under drying (D) and cutting-drying (C–D) treatments were significantly higher than those of the other four treatments (P ≤ 0.05). Collectively, the above results will not only provide novel processing methods that will improve the yield of active ingredients for S. baicalensis, but also shed light on the optimization of processing technology for the industrial production of medicinal crops.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112985,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112985,Scopus,10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112985,2020-12-15,,,

1335,Magnetic particle targeting for diagnosis and therapy of lung cancers,"Over the past decade, the growing interest in targeted lung cancer therapy has guided researchers toward the cutting edge of controlled drug delivery, particularly magnetic particle targeting. Targeting of tissues by magnetic particles has tackled several limitations of traditional drug delivery methods for both cancer detection (e.g., using magnetic resonance imaging) and therapy. Delivery of magnetic particles offers the key advantage of high efficiency in the local deposition of drugs in the target tissue with the least harmful effect on other healthy tissues. This review first overviews clinical aspects of lung morphology and pathogenesis as well as clinical features of lung cancer. It is followed by reviewing the advances in using magnetic particles for diagnosis and therapy of lung cancers: (i) a combination of magnetic particle targeting with MRI imaging for diagnosis and screening of lung cancers, (ii) magnetic drug targeting (MDT) through either intravenous injection and pulmonary delivery for lung cancer therapy, and (iii) computational simulations that models new and effective approaches for magnetic particle drug delivery to the lung, all supporting improved lung cancer treatment. The review further discusses future opportunities to improve the clinical performance of MDT for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer and highlights clinical therapy application of the MDT as a new horizon to cure with minimal side effects a wide variety of lung diseases and possibly other acute respiratory syndromes (COVID-19, MERS, and SARS).",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.09.017,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.09.017,Scopus,10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.09.017,2020-12-10,,,

1376,"The early impact of COVID-19 on mental health and community physical health services and their patients’ mortality in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, UK","Background COVID-19 has affected social interaction and healthcare worldwide. Methods We examined changes in presentations and referrals to the primary provider of mental health and community health services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, UK (population ~0·86 million), plus service activity and deaths. We conducted interrupted time series analyses with respect to the time of UK “lockdown”, which was shortly before the peak of COVID-19 infections in this area. We examined changes in standardized mortality ratio for those with and without severe mental illness (SMI). Results Referrals and presentations to nearly all mental and physical health services dropped at lockdown, with evidence for changes in both supply (service provision) and demand (help-seeking). This was followed by an increase in demand for some services. This pattern was seen for all major forms of presentation to liaison psychiatry services, except for eating disorders, for which there was no evidence of change. Inpatient numbers fell, but new detentions under the Mental Health Act were unchanged. Many services shifted from face-to-face to remote contacts. Excess mortality was primarily in the over-70s. There was a much greater increase in mortality for patients with SMI, which was not explained by ethnicity. Conclusions COVID-19 has been associated with a system-wide drop in the use of mental health services, with some subsequent return in activity. “Supply” changes may have reduced access to mental health services for some. “Demand” changes may reflect a genuine reduction of need or a lack of help-seeking with pent-up demand. There has been a disproportionate increase in death among those with SMI during the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.020,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.020,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.020,2020-12-01,,,

1390,Suicidal behaviors and ideation during emerging viral disease outbreaks before the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic rapid review,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is the most severe pandemic of the 21st century, on track to having a rising death toll. Beyond causing respiratory distress, COVID-19 may also cause mortality by way of suicide. The pathways by which emerging viral disease outbreaks (EVDOs) and suicide are related are complex and not entirely understood. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on the association between EVDOs and suicidal behaviors and/or ideation. An electronic search was conducted using five databases: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus in April 2020. A rapid systematic review was carried out, which involved separately and independently extracting quantitative data of selected articles. The electronic search yielded 2480 articles, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the data were collected in Hong Kong (n = 3) and the USA (n = 3). Four studies reported a slight but significant increase in deaths by suicide during EVDOs. The increase in deaths by suicide was mainly reported during the peak epidemic and in older adults. Psychosocial factors such as the fear of being infected by the virus or social isolation related to quarantine measures were the most prominent factors associated with deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Overall, we found scarce and weak evidence for an increased risk of deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Our results inform the need to orient public health policies toward suicide prevention strategies targeting the psychosocial effects of EVDOs. High-quality research on suicide risk and prevention are warranted during the current pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106264,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106264,Scopus,10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106264,2020-12-01,,,

1475,Relative bradycardia as a clinical feature in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A report of two cases,"We treated two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Case 1 was a 73-year-old Japanese man. Computed tomography (CT) revealed ground-glass opacities in both lungs. He had severe respiratory failure with a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspiratory oxygen ratio (P/F ratio) of 203. Electrocardiogram showed a heart rate (HR) of 56beats/min, slight ST depression in leads II, III, and aVF, and mild saddle-back type ST elevation in leads V1 and V2. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level was slightly elevated. Despite a high fever and hypoxemia, his HR remained within 50–70beats/min. Case 2 was a 52-year-old Japanese woman. CT revealed ground-glass opacities in the lower left lung. Electrocardiogram showed a HR of only 81beats/min, despite a body temperature of 39.2°C, slight ST depression in leads V4, V5, V6, and a prominent U wave in multiple leads. She had an elevated cTnT and a P/F ratio of 165. Despite a high fever and hypoxemia, her HR remained within 50–70beats/min. Both patients had a poor compensatory increase in their HR, despite their critical status. Relative bradycardia could be a cardiovascular complication and is an important clinical finding in patients with COVID-19. <Learning objective: We report two Japanese cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with relative bradycardia as a condition and no significant compensatory increase in heart rate despite high fever and severe hypoxemia. Relative bradycardia in COVID-19 might be associated with myocardial injury due to not only direct viral involvement but also systemic inflammation. We should carefully observe the occurrence of relative bradycardia because it could potentially be a clinical sign of COVID-19.>",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jccase.2020.07.015,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jccase.2020.07.015,Scopus,10.1016/j.jccase.2020.07.015,2020-12-01,,,
1476,COVID-19 and overdose prevention: Challenges and opportunities for clinical practice in housing settings,"The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will exacerbate the negative health outcomes associated with the concurrent opioid overdose crisis in North America. COVID-19 brings unique challenges for practitioners who provide opioid use disorder (OUD) care. The majority of overdose deaths in the Canadian province of British Columbia occur in housing environments. Some supportive housing environments in Vancouver, British Columbia, have on-site primary care and substance use disorder treatment clinics. Some of these housing environments also include supervised consumption services. These housing environments needed to make adjustments to their care to adhere to COVID-19 physical distancing measures. Such adjustments included a pandemic withdrawal management program to provide patients with a pharmaceutical grade alternative to the toxic illicit drug supply, which allow patients to avoid the heightened overdose risk while using illicit drugs alone or potentially exposing themselves to COVID-19 while using drugs in a group setting. Other modifications to the OUD care continuum included modified supervised injection spaces to adhere to physical distancing, the use of personal protective equipment for overdose response, virtual platforms for clinical encounters, writing longer prescriptions, and providing take-home doses to promote opioid agonist treatment retention. These strategies aim to mitigate indoor overdose risk while also addressing COVID-19 risks.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108153,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108153,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108153,2020-12-01,,,

This multicenter, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study aimed to assess the use of subcutaneous tocilizumab in adult patients with severe and critical COVID-19. Tocilizumab was added to the standard care of therapy at a dose of 324 mg (<100 kg bodyweight) or 486 mg (≥100 kg bodyweight). The study endpoints were all-cause mortality rate, changes in oxygen-support level, oxygen saturation, body temperature, respiratory rate, and laboratory variables during the study, and drug safety. Of 126 patients enrolled, 86 had severe and 40 had critical disease. Most patients were male (63.49%) and aged below 65 (78.57%). By day 14 of the study, 4.65% (4/86) of severe patients and 50.00% (20/40) of critical patients died. By the end, 6.98% (6/86) of severe patients and 60.00% (24/40) of critical patients died.Outcomes concerning three additional endpoints (oral temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate)were significantly improved as early as three days after tocilizumab administration in both groups of subjects, more considerably in severe patients. Significant improvement in the required level of oxygenation was reported in severe patients seven days after tocilizumab administration. No tocilizumab-related serious adverse event occurred in this study. Subcutaneous tocilizumab might improve some clinical parameters and reduce the risk of death in COVID-19 patients, particularly if used in the early stages of respiratory failure.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107102,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107102,Scopus,10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107102,2020-12-01,,,

Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Laboratory tests revealed an increased white blood cell count, with neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia, elevated level of C-reactive protein, borderline elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and slightly elevated interleukin 6. Echocardiography showed a hyperechogenic pericardium posterolaterally with minimal localized pericardial effusion. A chest computed tomography scan showed a small zone of ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe (classified as CO-RADS 3).

1495,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population: A systematic review,"Background As a major virus outbreak in the 21st century, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. While psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general public's mental health requires significant attention as well. This systematic review aims to synthesize extant literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and its associated risk factors. Methods A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to 17 May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. A manual search on Google Scholar was performed to identify additional relevant studies. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. Results: Relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety (6.33% to 50.9%), depression (14.6% to 48.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (7% to 53.8%), psychological distress (34.43% to 38%), and stress (8.1% to 81.9%) are reported in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Spain, Italy, Iran, the US, Turkey, Nepal, and Denmark. Risk factors associated with distress measures include female gender, younger age group (≤40 years), presence of chronic/psychiatric illnesses, unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. Limitations A significant degree of heterogeneity was noted across studies. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological distress that, in many cases, would meet the threshold for clinical relevance.

1496,Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines,"Background The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to societies’ mental health. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines. Methods A total of 1879 completed online surveys were gathered from March 28-April 12, 2020. Collected data included socio-demographics, health status, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures, information needs, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) ratings. Results The IES-R mean score was 19.57 (SD=13.12) while the DASS-21 mean score was 25.94 (SD=20.59). In total, 16.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate-to-severe; 16.9% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% had moderate-to-severe anxiety levels; and 13.4% had moderate-to-severe stress levels. Female gender; youth age; single status; students; specific symptoms; recent imposed quarantine; prolonged home-stay; and reports of poor health status, unnecessary worry, concerns for family members, and discrimination were significantly associated with greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). Adequate health information, having grown-up children, perception of good health status and confidence in doctors’ abilities were significantly associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). Limitations An English online survey was used. Conclusion During the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact.

1502,Factors related to preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness,"Background/Purpose Because of the spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors become important for individuals, especially those who are vulnerable. The present study proposes a model to explain the preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness in Taiwan. Methods A cross-sectional design was carried out and 414 patients with mental illness (230 males [55.6%]; mean age = 46.32 [SD = 10.86]) agreed to participate in the study. All the participants completed the Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale, Self-Stigma Scale-Short, Believing COVID-19 Information Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Regression models and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied to examine the factors associated with preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Results Both regression models and SEM showed that trust in COVID-19 information sources (standardized coefficient [β] = 0.211 in regression; β = 0.194 in SEM) and fear of COVID-19 (β = −0.128 in regression; β = −0.223 in SEM) significantly explained preventive behaviors among individuals with mental illness. The SEM further showed that fear of COVID-19 was significantly explained by trust in COVID-19 information sources (β = 0.220) and self-stigma (β = 0.454). Conclusion Based on the results, healthcare providers should help individuals with mental illness reduce self-stigma and fear of COVID-19 which would consequently improve their preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Moreover, improving trust in COVID-19 information sources for individuals with mental illness may be another method to improve their preventive behaviors.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2020.07.032,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2020.07.032,Scopus,10.1016/j.jfma.2020.07.032,2020-12-01,,,

Study design This is a pooled cross-sectional study. Methods Online survey data were analysed from 2000 Japanese adults collected in April and May 2020. Information was obtained on 13 COVID-19 preventive behaviours and anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the associations. Results In models adjusted for demographic and socio-economic factors, anxiety (coefficient: −0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −1.30, -0.24) and depressive symptoms (coefficient: −0.82, 95% CI: −1.34, -0.30) were both associated with significantly lower engagement in COVID-19 preventive behaviours.

1516,Different impacts of COVID-19-related information sources on public worry: An online survey through social media,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread rapidly, as did COVID-19-related information on diverse media platforms. Excessive COVID-19-related information caused substantial mental distress among the public. Although most studies focused on the impact of information on individuals during the pandemic, they usually focused on information from internet sources, and few studies compared the impacts between different information sources. We examine the sociodemographic profiles of participants receiving different information sources and the impact of various COVID-19-related information sources on public worry. Methods A cross-sectional online survey with a total of 2007 participants aged 20 years and above recruited anonymously was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sociodemographic data, frequencies at which participants received COVID-19-related information, the information sources (e.g., traditional media, interpersonal information exchange, and academic courses), and the levels of past, current, and anticipated worry about COVID-19 were assessed. Results The most common sources of COVID-19-related information were internet media (80.52%), traditional media (52.62%), family members (24.36%), coworkers (23.57%), friends (21.08%), academic courses (20.18%), and medical staff (19.03%). We found that the COVID-19-related information from traditional media, internet media, and friends was associated with higher current worry (the unstandardized regression coefficient, B, ranged from 0.27 to 0.30), and the information from friends was associated with higher past worry (B was 0.18). In contrast, participants who received information from academic courses had lower past worry and anticipated worry (B ranged from −0.15 to −0.17). Conclusions Academic courses may play a protective role in public worry during the pandemic. Therefore, academic courses and the information they provide may help facilitate public education and reduce public worry in cases of infectious disease outbreaks.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100350,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100350,Scopus,10.1016/j.invent.2020.100350,2020-12-01,,,

1520,Nurses endured high risks of psychological problems under the epidemic of COVID-19 in a longitudinal study in Wuhan China,"Background Health care workers, especially frontline nurses, faced great challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Aims To assess the magnitude of the psychological status and associated risk factors among nurses in the pandemic center in Wuhan, China. Methods In this study, we enrolled nurses from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The questionnaire was designed to obtain basic information of the participants, and included four psychological assessment scales. We issued the questionnaires at two different points of time. We conducted the first survey on January 29 to February 2 (outbreak period) with 709 eligible responses, and the second survey on February 26 to February 28 (stable period) with 621 eligible responses. The nurses from Wuchang Fangcang shelter hospital were also enrolled in the second survey. Results During the pandemic, over one-third of nurses suffered from depression, anxiety, and insomnia. In the outbreak period, the nurses showed significantly higher risks for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than those in the stable period (P < 0.01). Notably, the nurses from the Fangcang shelter hospitals were more likely to present psychological problems than those from other frontline or non-frontline (all P < 0.001) units, especially for insomnia (38.3% with severe insomnia). The nurses from the frontline, with worse physical condition and uncertain concerns about this pandemic as compared to the others, were more likely to bear psychological problems. Thus, online psychological information and sufficient protection conditions were effective interventions to help mitigate psychological distress. The nurses from Fangcang shelter hospitals suffered a significantly higher risk of psychological problems than those from other units. Conclusion The psychological status of nurses needs more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those who fought in the frontline during the peak of the outbreak.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.007,2020-12-01,,,

1533,"Young people, mental health and COVID-19 infection: the canaries we put in the coal mine","Objectives The number of people testing positive for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in the UK, particularly among young adults, is increasing. We report here on the mental health of young adults and related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic and consider the role of these factors in fuelling the increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this group. Methods An online survey was completed during the first six weeks of the first UK-wide lockdown by 3097 respondents, including data for 364 respondents aged 18–24 years. The survey included measures of mental health and indices capturing related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic. Results The mental health of 18- to 24-years-olds in the first 6 weeks of lockdown was significantly poorer than that of older respondents and previously published norms: with 84% reporting symptoms of depression and 72% reporting symptoms of anxiety. Young adults also reported significantly greater loneliness and reduced positive mood, both of which were also associated with greater mental health difficulties. Conclusions We contend that the combination of mental health, social and economic considerations may have contributed to the rise of COVID-19 infections in young adults, and ascribing blame to this group will not aid our efforts to regain control of the disease.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.10.018,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.10.018,Scopus,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.10.018,2020-12-01,,,

1535,Psychological stress among health care professionals during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease Outbreak: Cases from online consulting customers,"Background During the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, online consulting has been widely used to address mental health problems, including health care professionals (HCPs) caring for COVID-19 patients who experienced substantial psychological distress. Aim To explore the severity of perceived stress and potential correlates among the HCPs seeking online mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods A descriptive study was conducted among 34 HCPs to assess levels of psychological distress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. The HCPs working in different departments were compared using χ2-test for categorized variables and t-test for continuous ones, followed by the analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) to compare the perceived stress. Linear regression for the PSS-10 score was performed to identify potential correlates of stress. Results The sample overall (n = 34) showed a relatively moderate level of perceived stress (PSS mean = 15.71 ± 4.02) with 38% identified as depressed (PHQ-9 ≥ 5) and 24% as suffering from anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 5). Those working at intensive care units (ICUs) or in departments of respiratory medicine (RM) demonstrated significantly higher perceived stress than those at other departments (adjusted mean: 17.48 ± 0.96 vs. 13.06 ± 1.25, p = .018, partial η2 = 0.173). High perceived stress was most strongly associated with being depressed (beta = 0.486, p = .002) and working at ICUs/RM (beta = 0.345, p = .023). Conclusions The psychological health status of frontline health care professionals during the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak warrants clinical attention.

1536,Revising our attitudes towards agonist medications and their diversion in a time of pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic led government regulators to relax prescribing rules for buprenorphine and methadone, the agonist medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder, allowing for take home supplies of up to 28 days. These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108139,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108139,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108139,2020-12-01,,,

Methods Although a review of the literature shows that digital technology overuse in youth represents an important topic to be studied itself (during the pandemic and afterwards), the present work also takes into account findings from Affective Neuroscience Theory (ANT). Results An investigation of digital overuse while the COVID-19 pandemic (and beyond) against the background of ANT calls for a shift of perspective in research, at least as an important supplement to research efforts querying the actual nature of digital overuse. In the present work, we argue that it is high time to more comprehensively address why children spend too much time with screens and to also highlight the indirect media effects of screen time use (e.g. less mammalian rough and tumble PLAY time outside and elevated SADNESS due to parental neglect).

1546,Possible application of high-dose vitamin C in the prevention and therapy of coronavirus infection,"Coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses increase oxidative stress in the body leading to cellular and tissue damage. To combat this, administration of high-dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate), in addition to standard conventional supportive treatments, has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy for severe cases of respiratory viral infection. Morbidity, mortality, infectiveness and spread of infectious diseases are dependent on the host–pathogen relationship. Given the lack of effective and safe antiviral drugs for coronaviruses, there should be more attention in supporting host immune defence, cytoprotection and immunoregulation. Implementation of high-dose vitamin C therapy could dramatically reduce the need for high doses of corticosteroids, antibacterials and antiviral drugs that may be immunosuppressive, adrenal depressive and toxic, complicating the disease course. In order to effectively fight the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, medical professionals should explore readily available pharmaceutical and nutritional therapeutic agents with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunosupportive properties. Supplemental vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the disease course and lessen complications of the disease.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.09.025,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.09.025,Scopus,10.1016/j.jgar.2020.09.025,2020-12-01,,,

1549,Standing up for health – improving mental wellbeing during COVID-19 isolation by reducing sedentary behaviour,"The global COVID-19 outbreak and its management are disrupting ways of life and increasing the risk of poor mental and physical health for many. The restrictions on movement have made some forms of physical activity harder to achieve and increased the chances of more sedentary behaviour. Independent of exercise taken, sedentary behaviour can have a negative impact upon mental health, especially by lowering mood. We suggest evidence-based ways of reducing sedentary behaviour with commentary on how they may be adapted for life at home. These include: ways to use external cues, moving more frequently, maximising movement whilst waiting, reallocating time, workstation alternatives, restructuring the physical environment and recruiting help from others. At a time in which our mental and physical health needs are more critical than ever, the relationship between sedentary behaviour and low mood is of particular importance. The current situation represents a good opportunity for us all to change habits to implement a less sedentary lifestyle, for now and the future. This can start with changes we can make at home during lockdown.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.137,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.137,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.137,2020-12-01,,,

1553,Stress and parenting during the global COVID-19 pandemic,"Background Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. Objective This study examined the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Participants and Setting Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. Method Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 risk factors, mental health risk factors, protective factors, parental perceived stress, and child abuse potential. Results Greater COVID-19 related stressors and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher parental perceived stress. Receipt of financial assistance and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic are associated with lower perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related stressors, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. Conclusion Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104699,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104699,Scopus,10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104699,2020-12-01,,,
1554,Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and psychological distress symptoms in patients with affective disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to stress worldwide, especially in vulnerable people like those suffering from mental illness. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by a cohort of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD) after a seven-week period of lockdown measures, and to analyze serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels as a potential predictor of distress severity. Methods. Fifty-nine remitted MDD and fifty-three euthymic BD patients were enrolled. An online dedicated survey was administered to obtain lockdown-related information and to evaluate COVID-19 related distress by using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Patients’ medical records were reviewed to collect sociodemographic and clinical data, including serum 25(OH)D levels dosed in the three months preceding the outbreak. A multivariate general linear model was adopted to test the effect of factors of interest on psychological distress. Results. In our sample (n = 112), 29 subjects (25.9 %) reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 35 (31.2 %) and 48 (42.9 %) displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood of psychological distress, respectively. Low serum 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.005) and MDD diagnosis (p = 0.001) specifically predicted the severity of psychological distress. Living alone during the lockdown, a longer duration of illness, and smoking habits were more frequently detected in subjects with COVID-19 related distress. Conclusions. Low serum 25(OH)D levels and MDD diagnosis predicted an increased vulnerability to the stressful impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results suggest that vitamin D may represent a biological factor mediating the psychological response to stress in individuals with affective disorders and provide further insight into tailoring intervention strategies.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104869,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104869,Scopus,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104869,2020-12-01,,,

Methods A literature search was conducted to confirm the effects of COVID-19 on psychological and mental health of survivors. In addition to this, on the basis of signs and symptoms, TCM were used on treat mental disorder as per suggested clinical and animal experimental data plus relevant records in classical Chinese medicine books written by Zhang Zhongiing during Han Dynasty. A series of treatment plans were prescribed for COVID-19 survivors with psychological and mental disorders. Results According to previous extensive studies focusing on effects on mental health of survivors, high incidence was observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) survivors. During investigations of mental health of COVID-19 patients and survivors, it is observed that they also had symptoms of mental disorders and immune dysfunction. Furthermore, it was also proposed that depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were most common mental disorders requiring special attention after the recovery from COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 were analyzed, and the TCM syndrome of the depression, anxiety and PTSD after recovered from COVID19 was interpreted as internal heat and Yin deficiency. These three mental disorders pertains the category of “Lily disease”, “hysteria” and “deficient dysphoria” in TCM. Conclusion Lily Bulb, Rhizoma Anemarrhena Decoction and Ganmai Dazao Decoction were used to treat depression. Suanzaoren Decoction, Huanglian Ejiao Decoction and Zhizi Chi Decoction were suggested for anxiety.

While some early reports suggested increases in loneliness during the pandemic restrictions, others reported no changes. Here, we provide an update on self-reported loneliness over the first 6-months of community lockdown restrictions from a nationwide sample of 6,186 U.S. adults who completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale-3 and Public Health Questionnaire-9 during the pandemic. Loneliness scores increased significantly from April through September 2020 and were significantly higher for those reporting they were under stay-at-home, shelter-in-place, or lockdown orders compared to those reporting no restrictions. Greater loneliness was positively correlated with depression and suicidal ideation.

1563,"Anxiety disorders, climate change, and the challenges ahead: Introduction to the special issue","Climate change involves (1) increases in the prevalence of extreme weather events (e.g., wildfires, floods, hurricanes), (2) more gradual climatic changes (e.g., rising sea levels, desertification), and (3) increased risks of pandemics and other widespread disease outbreaks. Anxiety evoked by the threat of climate change can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Adaptive anxiety can motivate climate activism, such as efforts to reduce one’s carbon footprint. Maladaptive anxiety can take the form of anxious passivity, where the person feels anxious but incapable of addressing the problem of climate change, and may take the form of an anxiety disorder triggered or exacerbated by climatic stressors. Such stressors may involve exposure to extreme weather events or may involve exposure to other stressors such as forced migration due to rising sea levels or desertification. Three types of interventions are needed to address the various types of climate-related anxiety: (1) programs that motivate people to overcome anxious passivity and thereby take action to mitigate the effects of climate change, (2) treatment programs that address anxiety associated with exposure to climatic stressors, and (3) programs that build resilience at an individual and community level, to help people better cope with the challenges ahead.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102313,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102313,Scopus,10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102313,2020-12-01,,,

Methods This cross-sectional study examined 122 health care workers between April and May 2020 through the electronic use of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire, and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The perceptions of the participants towards stigmatisation of their profession during the COVID-19 pandemic were also assessed through a Likert's scale. The magnitude of anxiety, depression, and stress were analysed using a mean ± SD, correlation and percentages in respective statistics. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results This study found that 32.9% of the healthcare workers frequently faced COVID-19 cases during the ongoing pandemic. As many as 35.6% were unusually anxious. A mean anxiety score of 8.43 ± 4.6 was noted, with significantly higher scores for women and those workers with inadequate training (p < 0.001 and 0.028). Moreover, a mean depression score of 7.6 ± 4.7 (p < 0.002) was recorded for the healthcare workers with inadequate training. About 27.9% of the participants were depressed. The mean stress score of the study cohort was 6.86 ± 2.5. From the cohort, 24.5% and 72.8% experienced mild and moderate stress, respectively. This study found that inadequate training for infection control was associated with a higher proportion of anxiety and depression [OR 1.86 (95% CI: 1.5–2.3; p < 0.043) and OR 2.21 (95% CI: 1.7–2.8; p < 0.018), respectively.

1565,The endless quarantine: the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare workers after three months of mandatory social isolation in Argentina,"Objectives At the end of 2019 the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak spread around the globe with a late arrival to South America. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the long period of mandatory social isolation that took place in Argentina on the general psychological well-being of healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A survey was conducted during June 2020, in healthcare workers. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Sleepiness-Wakefulness Inability and Fatigue Test, and Goldberg depression and anxiety scale, were used to analyze the effects of the SARS-Cov 2 outbreak after three months of mandatory social isolation. Analyses were performed by logistic regression and a clustering algorithm in order to classify subjects in the function of their outcome's severity. Results From 1059 surveys, the majority reported symptoms of depression (81.0%), anxiety (76.5%), poor sleep quality (84.7%), and insomnia (73.7%) with 58.9% suffering from nightmares. Logistic regression showed that being in contact with COVID-19 patients, age, gender and the consumption of sleep medication during the mandatory social isolation were relevant predictors for insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Clustering analysis classified healthcare workers in three groups with healthy/mild, moderate, and severe outcomes. The most vulnerable group was composed mainly of younger people, female, non-medical staff, or physicians in training. Conclusion An extremely high proportion of Argentinian healthcare workers suffered from sleep problems, anxiety, and depression symptoms.

1571,COVID 19 pandemic: Mental health challenges of internal migrant workers of India,"COVID- 19, a biomedical disease has serious physical and tremendous mental health implications as the rapidly spreading pandemic. One of the most vulnerable, but neglected, an occupational community of internal migrant workers is prone for development of psychological ill-effects due to double whammy impact of COVID-19 crisis and concomitant adverse occupational scenario. Permutations and combinations of the factors viz susceptibility for new viral infections, potential to act as vectors of transmission of infection, high prevalence of pre-existing physical health morbidities such as occupational pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, HIV infections, pre-existing psychological morbidities, adverse psychosocial factors like absence of family support and caretaker during the crisis, their limitations to follow the rules and regulations of personal safety during the COVID 19 crisis, social exclusion, and inability to timely access the psychiatric services; all give rise to the peri-traumatic psychological distress to internal migrant workers. Superadded, is the blow of financial constraints due to loss of work, absence or suspension of occupational safety and health-related basic laws with associated occupational hazards, which make this occupational group highly vulnerable for the development of psychological illnesses. We attempt to draw the attention of mental health professionals, general medical practitioners and occupational health policymakers to the various, interrelated and interdependent predisposing and causative factors for the development of psychological ill-effects amongst internal migrant workers with the interventions needed to address it, from an occupational health perspective angle.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102254,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102254,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102254,2020-12-01,,,

A prospective national study on prevalence and risk factors","Background The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and emotional support among the general population are unclear. We therefore assessed if the prevalence of high Anxiety and Depression Symptoms (ADS) levels and lack of Emotional Support (ES) increased, and if risk factors of ADS and ES changed. Methods Data was extracted from surveys conducted with the Dutch longitudinal population-based LISS panel (N = 3,983). ADS and ES were assessed in March 2019 and 2020. Risk factors for ADS and ES were extracted from surveys in November 2018 and 2019. These were: ADS, gender, education, domestic situation, employment, age, ethnicity, lung and heart problems, and diabetes. Results The prevalence of high ADS levels and lack of ES did not increase compared to the pre-outbreak prevalence. ADS, non-native ethnic background, (partial) work disabilities and lung problems were predictive of both ADS and lack of ES in March 2019 and 2020. Job seekers, students and those who take care of housekeeping were more at risk for ADS in March 2020, but not in 2019. While 35–49 years old respondents were less at risk for ADS in March 2019, they were more at risk in 2020. Parents with child(ren) at home and those who take care of housekeeping more often lacked ES in March 2020, but not in 2019. Limitations No other mental health problems were assessed.

Although visiting restrictions are instituted to prolong the life of nursing home residents, they may detrimentally affect their quality of life. The aim of this study was to capture perspectives from the relatives of nursing home residents on nursing home visiting restrictions. Design A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. Setting and Participants A convenience sample of Dutch relatives of nursing home residents (n = 1997) completed an online survey on their perspectives regarding nursing home visiting restrictions. Methods The survey included Likert-item, multiselect, and open-answer questions targeting 4 key areas: (1) communication access to residents, (2) adverse effects of visiting restrictions on residents and relatives, (3) potential protective effect of visiting restrictions, (4) important aspects for relatives during and after visiting restrictions. Results Satisfaction of communication access to nursing home residents was highest when respondents had the possibility to communicate with nursing home residents by nurses informing them via telephone, contact behind glass, and contact outside maintaining physical distance. Satisfaction rates increased when respondents had multiple opportunities to stay in contact with residents. Respondents were concerned that residents had increased loneliness (76%), sadness (66%), and decreased quality of life (62%), whereas study respondents reported personal sadness (73%) and fear (26%). There was no consensus among respondents if adverse effects of the visiting restrictions outweighed the protective effect for nursing home residents. Respondents expressed the need for increased information, communication options, and better safety protocols. Conclusion and Implications Providing multiple opportunities to stay in touch with nursing home residents can increase satisfaction of communication between residents and relatives. Increased context-specific information, communication options, and safety protocols should be addressed in national health policy.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.031,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.031,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.031,2020-12-01,,,
1577,"Depression, anxiety, and stress mediate the associations between internet gaming disorder, insomnia, and quality of life during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background For many individuals, the COVID-19 outbreak has increased their psychological distress, changed their behaviors, and impacted their health. With more time spent indoors, many individuals have engaged in increased videogame playing. However, the associations between such behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak period is unclear. Objective The present study examined the mediating role of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) in the association between internet gaming disorder (IGD) and two health outcomes (insomnia quality of life) among adolescents during this COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study comprising adolescents (N = 1512) aged 13–18 years (mean age = 15.51 years) was utilized to assess measures on insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress, IGD, and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results There were small to large significant relationships between the variables. Psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) served as a strong mediator in the association between IGD and insomnia and quality of life. IGD directly influenced insomnia and quality of life among the participants. Conclusions IGD is associated with different psychosocial outcomes comprising multiple pathways. Parents need to pay special attention to how much time and how frequently their children play videogames. Parents may need to assist their children in coping with psychological distress during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic period.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100307,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100307,Scopus,10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100307,2020-12-01,,,
1578,Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in healthcare workers after the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak: A survey of a large tertiary care hospital in Wuhan,"This study examined the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and assessed mental illness via an online survey among healthcare workers (HCWs) at the Central Hospital of Wuhan after the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. PTSD symptoms were measured using the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C), with a cutoff score of 50. Among the 642 HCWs, the prevalence of probable PTSD was 20.87%. Additionally, 88.88%, 82.09%, 100%, and 95.52% of HCWs with probable PTSD reported varying degrees of anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and insomnia, respectively. HCWs with probable PTSD scored higher on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient Health questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) than non-PTSD HCWs (all p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that HCWs with negative COVID-19 tests (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.21–0.58; p < 0.00), those with high Social Support Self-Rating Scale (SSRS) scores (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17–0.52; p < 0.00), and HCWs whose family members tested negative (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42–0.96; p = 0.03) were less likely to have probable PTSD. This study found a high prevalence of probable PTSD and severe mental illness among local HCWs. Our finding emphasizes the need to provide mental health support for HCWs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113541,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113541,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113541,2020-12-01,,,
1579,Do suicide rates in children and adolescents change during school closure in Japan? The acute effect of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent mental health,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely impacted the lives of children and adolescents. School closure, one of the critical changes during the first COVID-19 wave, caused decreases in social contacts and increases in family time for children and adolescents. This can have both positive and negative influences on suicide, which is one of the robust mental health outcomes. However, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on children and adolescents in terms of suicide is unknown. Objective This study investigates the acute effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide among children and adolescents during school closure in Japan. Data Total number of suicides per month among children and adolescents under 20 years old between January 2018 and May 2020. Methods Poisson regression was used to examine whether suicide increased or decreased during school closure, which spanned from March to May 2020, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. Robustness check was conducted using all data from January 2018 to May 2020. Negative binomial regression, a model with overdispersion, was also performed. Results We found no significant change in suicide rates during the school closure (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81 to 1.64). We found the main effect of month, that is, suicides significantly increased suicides in May (IRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.78) compared to March, but the interaction terms of month and school closure were not significant (p > 0.1). Conclusions As preliminary findings, this study suggests that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly affected suicide rates among children and adolescents during the school closure in Japan.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104680,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104680,Scopus,10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104680,2020-12-01,,,

1584,Impact of viral epidemic outbreaks on mental health of healthcare workers: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: This study aimed at examining the impact of providing healthcare during health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health; to identify factors associated with worse impact, and; to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact. Method: Rapid systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (inception to August 2020). We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems, and used GRADE to ascertain the certainty of evidence. Results: We included 117 studies. The pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress disorder (40% (95%CI 39 to 41%)), followed by anxiety (30%, (30 to 31%)), burnout (28% (26 to 31%)), depression (24% (24 to 25%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13% (13 to 14%)). We identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high-risk environment, specific occupational roles, and lower levels of specialised training and job experience) factors. Four studies reported interventions for frontline HCW: two educational interventions increased confidence in pandemic self-efficacy and in interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty), whereas one multifaceted intervention improved anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). Limitations: We only searched three databases, and the initial screening was undertaken by a single reviewer. Conclusion: Given the very limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified represent important targets for future interventions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.034,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.034,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.034,2020-12-01,,,
1585,Addressing opioid overdose deaths: The vision for the HEALing communities study,"The United States is facing two devastating public health crises– the opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this context, one of the most ambitious implementation studies in addiction research is moving forward. Launched in May 2019, the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) was developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as part of the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative (National Institutes of Health, 2020). The goal for this research was to reduce opioid overdose deaths by 40 % in three years by enhancing and integrating the delivery of multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) with proven effectiveness in reducing opioid overdose deaths across health care, justice, and community settings. This paper describes the initial vision, goals, and objectives of this initiative; the impact of COVID-19; and the potential for knowledge to be generated from HCS at the intersection of an unrelenting epidemic of opioid misuse and overdoses and the ravishing COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108329,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108329,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108329,2020-12-01,,,

This study explored the independent and combined effects of the COVID-19 and economy-related variables on stress and anxiety among Lebanese adults in a developing country facing a severe socio-economic crisis and political turmoil. A cross-sectional study was conducted online between May 10 and 20, 2020, using the snowball sampling technique. All individuals over 18 were eligible. The final sample included 502 respondents. Higher stress and anxiety were associated with younger age, female gender, previous higher socio-economic status, having a family member with a chronic disease, fear of not getting access to treatment, fear of COVID-19, and physical violence at home. However, financial wellness and higher family satisfaction were significantly associated with lower stress. The multivariate analysis showed a significant interaction between fear of COVID-19 and financial wellness on estimated marginal means of stress and anxiety. The combined presence of fear of the pandemic and financial hardship is associated with higher stress and anxiety, particularly among women and younger Lebanese adults with difficult home circumstances.

1588,Alcohol use and mental health status during the first months of COVID-19 pandemic in Australia,"Background We aimed to estimate the population prevalence of people with changes in their usual patterns of alcohol use during the early stages of the novel coronavirus pandemic of 2020 (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia; assess the association between mental health status and changes in alcohol use during the pandemic; and examine if the associations were modified by gender and age. Methods This study was an anonymously-completed online self-report survey. Changes in alcohol use were assessed using a single fixed-choice study-specific question. Mental health was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. Results A total of 13,829 people contributed complete data and were included in the analysis. Overall, about one in five adults reported that they had been drinking more alcohol since the COVID-19 pandemic began than they used to. People were more likely to be drinking alcohol more than they used to if they had more severe symptoms of depression or anxiety. The associations between depressive and anxiety symptoms and increased alcohol use since the COVID-19 pandemic began were consistent between females and males. Limitations Online surveys are less accessible to some groups of people. The data are self-report and not diagnostic. Cross-sectional data can identify associations, not causal relationships. The study was limited to participants from Australia. Conclusions These data indicate that there is a need for public policies focused on alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic and the strategies should include specific consideration of the needs of people with mental health problems.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.012,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.012,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.012,2020-12-01,,,
1589,Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain,"Background Strict confinement and social distancing measures have been imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries. The aim was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys, separated by one month, performed in Spain. Methods Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. Results There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales, and daily physical activity to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. Conclusions Results indicated a temporal increase of anxiety, depression and stress scores during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Aims The objectives of this study were to describe the mental health status and the change in perceived strain among caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and procedures Two hundred sixty four caregivers completed an online survey that assessed demographics, use and perspective on tele-rehabilitation, homecare therapy, caregiver’s strain and mental health. Outcomes and results The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were found to be 62.5 %, 20.5 % and 36.4 % respectively. A significant difference in caregiver strain (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.93) was observed during the outbreak compared to levels pre-outbreak (pre-outbreak strain was measured retrospectively). Caregivers not using tele-rehabilitation along with a perception of it being a poor medium for rehabilitation were at greater risks for poor mental health whereas a negative perception on homecare therapy were strongly associated with higher psychological symptoms and strain. Conclusions and implications This study identified a high prevalence of depression and significant change in strain displayed by caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak.

1596,A framework for identifying and mitigating the equity harms of COVID-19 policy interventions,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Governments have implemented combinations of “lockdown” measures of various stringencies, including school and workplace closures, cancellations of public events, and restrictions on internal and external movements. These policy interventions are an attempt to shield high-risk individuals and to prevent overwhelming countries' healthcare systems, or, colloquially, “flatten the curve.” However, these policy interventions may come with physical and psychological health harms, group and social harms, and opportunity costs. These policies may particularly affect vulnerable populations and not only exacerbate pre-existing inequities but also generate new ones. Methods We developed a conceptual framework to identify and categorize adverse effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures. We based our framework on Lorenc and Oliver's framework for the adverse effects of public health interventions and the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework. To test its application, we purposively sampled COVID-19 policy examples from around the world and evaluated them for the potential physical, psychological, and social harms, as well as opportunity costs, in each of the PROGRESS-Plus equity domains: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Plus (age, and disability). Results We found examples of inequitably distributed adverse effects for each COVID-19 lockdown policy example, stratified by a low- or middle-income country and high-income country, in every PROGRESS-Plus equity domain. We identified the known policy interventions intended to mitigate some of these adverse effects. The same harms (anxiety, depression, food insecurity, loneliness, stigma, violence) appear to be repeated across many groups and are exacerbated by several COVID-19 policy interventions. Conclusion Our conceptual framework highlights the fact that COVID-19 policy interventions can generate or exacerbate interactive and multiplicative equity harms. Applying this framework can help in three ways: (1) identifying the areas where a policy intervention may generate inequitable adverse effects; (2) mitigating the policy and practice interventions by facilitating the systematic examination of relevant evidence; and (3) planning for lifting COVID-19 lockdowns and policy interventions around the world.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.004,2020-12-01,,,

1600,How is COVID-19 pandemic impacting mental health of children and adolescents?,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) affected virtually all countries. Uncertain about the health risk and an increasing financial loss will contribute to widespread emotional distress and an increased risk of psychiatric disorders shortly. Posttraumatic, anxiety, and depression disorders are expected during and aftermath of the pandemic. Some groups, like children, have more susceptibility to having long term consequences in mental health. Herein, we made a comprehensive and non-systematic search in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, SciELO, and Google Scholars) to answer the question: What are children's and adolescents' mental health effects of the pandemic? Furthermore, which features are essential for mental health in a pandemic? Results: Seventy-seven articles were selected for full text read, and 51 were included. Children answer stress differently, depending on the development stage. High rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic symptoms were identified among children. Discussion: Symptoms were as expected. New supportive strategies have appeared during this pandemic, but there is no measure of its effectiveness. Some groups seem to be more vulnerable to the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the mitigation actions should prioritize them. The school's role appears to be revalued by society. This review seems to pick good targets to prioritize mitigation actions aiming to spare children not only from the severe cases of COVID-19 but also to help them to deal with the mental health burden of the pandemics.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101845,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101845,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101845,2020-12-01,,,
1601,Sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic: not one size fits all,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic imposes a long period of stress on people worldwide and has been shown to significantly affect sleep duration across different populations. However, decreases in sleep quality rather than duration are associated with adverse mental health effects. Additionally, the one third of the general population suffering from poor sleep quality was underrepresented in previous studies. The current study aimed to elucidate effects of the COVID -19 pandemic on sleep quality across different levels of pre-pandemic sleep complaints and as a function of affect and worry. Method Participants (n = 667) of the Netherlands Sleep Registry (NSR) were invited for weekly online assessment of the subjective severity of major stressors, insomnia, sleep times, distress, depression, and anxiety using validated scales. Analysis To investigate the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sleep quality of people with and without a history of insomnia, we performed a mixed model analysis using pre-pandemic insomnia severity, negative affect, and worry as predictors. Results The effect of COVID -19 on sleep quality differs critically across participants, and depends on the pre-pandemic sleep quality. Interestingly, a quarter of people with pre-pandemic (clinical) insomnia experienced a meaningful improvement in sleep quality, whereas 20% of pre-pandemic good sleepers experienced worse sleep during the lockdown measures. Additionally, changes in sleep quality throughout the pandemic were associated with negative affect and worry. Conclusion Our data suggests that there is no uniform effect of the lockdown on sleep quality.

1608,Public mental health under the long-term influence of COVID-19 in China: Geographical and temporal distribution,"Background The mental health status caused by major epidemics is serious and lasting. At present, there are few studies about the lasting mental health effects of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental health of the Chinese public during the long-term COVID-19 outbreak. Methods A total of 1172 online questionnaires were collected, covering demographical information and 8 common psychological states: depression, anxiety, somatization, stress, psychological resilience, suicidal ideation and behavior, insomnia, and stress disorder. In addition, the geographical and temporal distributions of different mental states were plotted. Results Overall, 30.1% of smokers increased smoking, while 11.3% of drinkers increased alcohol consumption. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, mental health problems, high risk of suicidal and behavior, clinical insomnia, clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, moderate-to-high levels of perceived stress were 18.8%, 13.3%, 7.6%, 2.8%, 7.2%, 7.0%, and 67.9%, respectively. Further, the geographical distribution showed that the mental status in some provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities was relatively more serious. The temporal distribution showed that the psychological state of the participants was relatively poorer on February 20, 24 to 26 and March 25, especially on March 25. Limitations This cross-sectional design cannot make causal inferences. The snowball sampling was not representative enough. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of mental disorders in the Chinese public is relatively low in the second month of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at University of New Mexico hospital (UNMH) were screened for development of neurological complications during Feb 01 to April 29, 2020 via retrospective chart review. Results Total of 90 hospitalized patients were screened. Out of seven patients, majority were Native Americans females, and developed neurological complications including subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), Ischemic stroke (IS) and seizure. All 7 patients required Intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. Patients who developed CNS complications other than seizure were females in the younger age group (4 patients, 38-58 years) with poor outcome. Out of 7, three developed subarachnoid hemorrhage, two developed ischemic infarction, and four developed seizure. Two patients with hemorrhagic complication expired during the course of hospitalization. All three patients with seizure were discharged to home. Conclusion Patients with serious CNS complications secondary to COVID-19 infection were observed to be Native Americans.

1610,The mediation role of sleep quality in the association between the incidence of unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 quarantine and mental health,"Background Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. Methods Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; ≥4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; ≥4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. Results The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%).

1613,Validation of the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaires for Chronic Medical Conditions: A Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Cohort study,"Objective Fear associated with medical vulnerability should be considered when assessing mental health among individuals with chronic medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to develop and validate the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions. Methods Fifteen initial items were generated based on suggestions from 121 people with the chronic autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). Patients in a COVID-19 SSc cohort completed items between April 9 and 27, 2020. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and item analysis were used to select items for inclusion. Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate internal consistency reliability and convergent validity. Factor structure was confirmed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in follow-up data collection two weeks later. Results 787 participants completed baseline measures; 563 of them completed the follow-up assessment. Ten of 15 initial items were included in the final questionnaire. EFA suggested that a single dimension explained the data reasonably well. There were no indications of floor or ceiling effects. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91. Correlations between the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire and measures of anxiety (r = 0.53), depressive symptoms (r = 0.44), and perceived stress (r = 0.50) supported construct validity. CFA supported the single-factor structure (χ2(35) = 311.2, p < 0.001, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.97, Comparative Fit Index = 0.96, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.12).

1617,Does having a high-risk pregnancy influence anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Objective We aimed to analyze the changing level of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant women, with and without high-risk indicators separately, in a tertiary care center serving also for COVID-19 patients, in the capital of Turkey. Study design We designed a case-control and cross-sectional study using surveys. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaire (STAI-T) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) which were validated in Turkish were given to outpatient women with high-risk pregnancies as study group and normal pregnancies as control group. A total of 446 women were recruited. Results There was a statistically significant difference between those with and without high-risk pregnancy in terms of Trait-State Anxiety scores with COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.05). We found an increased prevalence of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk pregnant women comparing to pregnancies with no risk factors (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the education level in high-risk pregnant women in terms of anxiety scores (p < 0.05), Beck Anxiety score was highest in high school graduates (42.75). While the level of Trait Anxiety was the highest with pandemic in those with high-risk pregnancy with threatened preterm labor and preterm ruptures of membranes (58.0), those with thrombophilia were the lowest (50.88). The State Anxiety level and Beck Anxiety Score of those with maternal systemic disease were the highest (53.32 and 45.53), while those with thrombophilia were the lowest (46.96 and 40.08). The scores of Trait Anxiety (56.38), State Anxiety (52.14), Beck Anxiety (43.94) were statistically higher during the pandemic in those hospitalized at least once (p < 0.05). Conclusion High-risk pregnant women require routine anxiety and depression screening and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-risk pregnancy patients have comorbid conditions most of the time, hence they not only at more risk for getting infected, but also have higher anxiety scores because of the stress caused by COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.10.055,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.10.055,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.10.055,2020-12-01,,,

1619,The relationship between air pollution and COVID-19-related deaths: An application to three French cities,"Being heavily dependent to oil products (mainly gasoline and diesel), the French transport sector is the main emitter of Particulate Matter (PMs) whose critical levels induce harmful health effects for urban inhabitants. We selected three major French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Marseille) to investigate the relationship between the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak and air pollution. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) experiments, we have determined the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 linked to COVID-19-related deaths. Our focus is on the potential effects of Particulate Matter (PM) in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that a pre-determined particulate concentration can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. The empirical strategy used an innovative Machine Learning (ML) methodology. In particular, through the so-called cutting technique in ANNs, we found new threshold levels of PM2.5 and PM10 connected to COVID-19: 17.4 µg/m3 (PM2.5) and 29.6 µg/m3 (PM10) for Paris; 15.6 µg/m3 (PM2.5) and 20.6 µg/m3 (PM10) for Lyon; 14.3 µg/m3 (PM2.5) and 22.04 µg/m3 (PM10) for Marseille. Interestingly, all the threshold values identified by the ANNs are higher than the limits imposed by the European Parliament. Finally, a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm is applied to check the consistency of our findings.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115835,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115835,Scopus,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115835,2020-12-01,,,

1622,Rapid report 2: Symptoms of anxiety and depression during the first 12 weeks of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia,"Background The MindSpot Clinic, funded by the Australian Government, is a national digital mental health service (DMHS) providing services to people experiencing anxiety and depression. We recently reported increased service use in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic (19 March to 15 April 2020), and a small increase in anxiety symptoms. This follow-up paper examines trends in service use and symptoms, over 12 weeks from 19 March to 10 June 2020. Methods Demographics, symptoms, and psychosocial stressors were compared for participants starting an online assessment over four time-periods: A baseline “Comparison period” prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (1 to 28 September 2019), “Weeks 1–4” of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (19 March–15 April 2020), “Weeks 5–8” (16 April–13 May 2020) and “Weeks 9–12” (14 May–10 June). Responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 and strategies used by participants to improve their mental wellbeing are also reported. Results A total of 5455 people started a mental health assessment with MindSpot from 19 March to 10 June 2020. The number of assessments per week rose steadily from 303 in week 1 to a peak of 578 in week 5. Symptoms of anxiety were highest in Weeks 1–4, declining steadily over subsequent weeks. Psychological distress and depression, as measured by the K-10 and PHQ-9 respectively, remained stable. Concern about COVID-19 was highest in the first week then steadily declined during the following weeks. The proportions of participants reporting changes to routine were consistent across the 12 weeks, and most participants reported adopting helpful strategies to improve their mental wellbeing. Conclusions We observed an initial increase in service use, which reduced over the 12 weeks. The initial rise in anxiety symptoms returned to baseline. Reported concern about the effect of COVID-19 declined steadily over 12 weeks. Symptoms of psychological distress and depression measured by the K-10 and PHQ-9, and the proportion reporting suicidal thoughts and plans did not change, and to date we have not identified indications of a mental health crisis. However, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the economy and large sections of society are yet to be fully realised, indicating the importance of ongoing monitoring and reporting of trends as indicators of the mental health of the nation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100351,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100351,Scopus,10.1016/j.invent.2020.100351,2020-12-01,,,

1624,“The psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical education of final year students in Pakistan: A cross-sectional study”,"Introduction COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a strong impact on students’ wellbeing, with associated uncertainty about the future. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the psychological effects of COVID-19 on the medical education of final year students in Pakistan. Methods We conducted prospective, cross-sectional survey, as a snapshot, from June 07, 2020 till June 16, 2020, among final year medical and dental students. The 20-questions survey questionnaire was based on rating-scale items to focus on psychological symptoms, institutional preparedness for such crisis and confidence in becoming a future doctor. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Multivariate regression analysis. Results Majority of participants (n = 1753/2661, 65.9%) were female. Despite timely closure of institutes, delay in the start of the online teaching (beta coefficient 0.08, P-value 0.02) was significantly correlated with the depressive symptoms. A significant percentage of students (n = 1594, 59.9%) wanted a delay in exit exams due to intimidation. A similar proportion of students also lost confidence to be a competent doctor in future which was positively associated with male gender (beta coefficient 0.21, P-value < 0.001). Conclusion Our study shows that COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant psychological influence on the medical education of final year students. Despite a stressful crisis, final year medical and dental students are still willing to serve the community. In addition to supporting their emotions and psychological wellbeing, stress counselling, and transforming current medical curricula is crucial to pursue ceaseless medical education and to become a safe future doctor.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.11.025,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.11.025,Scopus,10.1016/j.amsu.2020.11.025,2020-12-01,,,

1628,"Psychological distress associated with COVID-19 quarantine: Latent profile analysis, outcome prediction and mediation analysis","Background Mental health of the population during COVID-19 quarantine could be at risk. Previous studies in short quarantines, found mood-related and anxiety symptomatology. Here we aimed to characterize the subtypes of psychological distress associated with quarantine, assess its prevalence, explore risk/protective factors, and possible mechanisms. Methods Online cross-sectional data (n = 4408) was collected during the Argentine quarantine, between 1st-17th April 2020 along a small replication study (n = 644). Psychological distress clusters were determined using latent profile analysis on a wide-range of symptoms using the complete Brief-Symptom Inventory-53. Multinomial and Elastic-net regression were performed to identify risk/protective factors among trait-measures (Personality and Resilience) and state-measures (COVID-19 related fear and coping-skills). Results Three latent-classes defined by symptom severity level were identified. The majority of individuals were classified in the mild (40.9%) and severe classes (41.0%). Participants reported elevated symptoms of Phobic-Anxiety (41.3%), Anxiety (31.8%), Depression (27.5%), General-Distress (27.1%), Obsession-Compulsion (25.1%) and Hostility (13.7%). Logistic-regressions analyses mainly revealed that women, young individuals, having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or trauma, having high levels of trait-neuroticism and COVID-related fear, were those at greater risk of psychological distress. In contrast, adults, being married, exercising, having upper-class income, having high levels of trait-resilience and coping-skills, were the most protected. Mediation analysis, showed that state-measures mediated the association between trait-measures and class-membership. Conclusions Quarantine was associated intense psychological distress.

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess mental health. Chi-square (χ2) and Fisher –Exact test were used to assess the statistical significance among variables. P values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results 715 participants were included in the final analyses (78.41% females and 21.53% males). Most were residents in Albania (80.41%) and the others resided mainly in Italy (6.89%), Greece (3.51%), Germany (2.43%), Kosovo (1.62%) and the UK (1.69%). Statistical association was found between gender, country of residency and measures taken. Summary score of PHQ-9 items was 6.4662. The total score of depression classification shows that 31.82% and 12.90% of participants have respectively mild and moderate depression. Female participants showed the highest score for some items of PHQ-9, p≤0.05. Conclusions Findings suggest that health care professionals should recognize and address mental health problems associated with Covid-19 especially in vulnerable groups. Acting in a timely and proper manner is essential in preventing these problems from becoming chronic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2020.08.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2020.08.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.apnu.2020.08.003,2020-12-01,,,
1633,The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Teenagers in China,"Purpose The 2019 COVID-19 pandemic poses a challenge to adolescent psychological health. The aim of this study was to survey junior high and high school students in China to better understand the psychological consequences, such as anxiety, depression, and stress, of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional online survey using structural questionnaires was conducted from April 7, 2020, to April 24, 2020. Demographic information and general information related to the pandemic were collected. Psychological consequences were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Influencing factors were assessed by the Brief Resilience Scale and Coping Style Questionnaire. Results Our sample comprised 493 junior high school students (male = 239, mean age = 13.93 years) and 532 high school students (male = 289, mean age = 17.08 years). Resilience and positive coping were protective factors for the occurrence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in junior high and high school students (p < .05). Positive coping was a protective factor for trauma-related distress in junior high school students (p < .05). Negative coping is a risk factor for depression, anxiety, stress symptoms, and trauma-related distress in junior high and high school students (p < .05). Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic in China, more than one fifth of junior high and high school students' mental health was affected. Our findings suggested that resilience and positive coping lead to better psychological and mental health status among students. In contrast, negative coping is a risk factor for mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.026,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.026,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.026,2020-12-01,,,

1635,Historical trauma and social support as predictors of psychological stress responses in American Indian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background American Indians (AIs) live with historical trauma, or the cumulative emotional and psychological wounding that is passed from one generation to the next in response to the loss of lives and culture. Psychological consequences of historical trauma may contribute to health disparities. Purpose Here, we investigate whether historical trauma predicts changes in psychological stress associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in AI adults. Based on the stress-sensitization theory, we hypothesize that greater historical trauma will predict greater increases in levels of psychological stress from before the onset of the pandemic to after. Method: Our analytic sample consisted of 205 AI adults. We measured historical trauma and levels of psychological stress before and after the onset of the pandemic. Results Using hierarchical regression models controlling for age, biological sex, income, symptoms of depression and anxiety, psychological stress at Time 1, COVID-19 specific stress, and childhood trauma, we found that greater historical trauma preceding the pandemic predicted greater increases in psychological stress (β = 0.38, t = 5.17 p < .01, ΔR2 = 0.12), and levels of social support interacted with historical trauma to predict changes in psychological stress (β = −0.19, t = −3.34, p = .001, ΔR2 = 0.04). The relationship between historical trauma and changes in stress was significant for individuals with low levels of social support. Conclusions Historical trauma may contribute to AI mental health disparities, through heightened psychological stress responses to life stressors and social support appears to moderate this relationship.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110263,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110263,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110263,2020-12-01,,,
1636,The psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures: Experience from 4000 participants,"Background In February 2020 the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in Kuwait. Inevitably as many countries worldwide, the general public were negatively affected by the pandemic. Unemployment, uncertainty, distress, increasing deaths, lockdown measures all of which are potential burdens on mental health. Aim To assess the impact of COVID19 outbreak on mental health in Kuwait, and to explore the potential influencing risk factors. Methods We conducted an online questionnaire-based study in Kuwait between 25th May 2020 to 30th May 2020. Questions were based on demographics, lifestyle during outbreak, depression and anxiety assessment. Total PHQ9 and GAD7 scores were calculated for each responder. Results We had 4132 responders. Most were females (69.31%), married (59.37%), between the age of 21-30 (23.84%) and non-smokers (81.46%). Only (7.96%) had a positive past psychiatric history, (32.04%) had a past history of a chronic medical disease. During the outbreak most of the responders lost their jobs (39.21%) and only (12.83%) were attending work regularly, only (6.82%) worked in the healthcare sector. 59.27% report increased social media use compared to before the lockdown. When asked about their daily time spent following COVID19-related news, most (37.8%) spend more than 2 hours and (7.74%) spend more than 4 hours. The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was (30.13%) and the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was (25.28%). Limitations In the cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic caused a burden on mental health. Psychological support and mental health awareness should be implemented and made accessible to all individuals during pandemics.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.014,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.014,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.014,2020-12-01,,,
1637,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health &amp; wellbeing among home-quarantined Bangladeshi students: A cross-sectional pilot study,"Background COVID-19 is imposing threat both on physical and mental health since its outbreak. Bangladesh adopted lockdown strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, mental and physical health and this study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing among Bangladeshi students. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between 9th and 23rd April 2020 among 505 college and university students. Data was collected by using online questionnaire including DASS 21 and IES. Descriptive analysis and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. Results 28.5 % of the respondents had stress, 33.3% anxiety, 46.92% depression from mild to extremely severe, according to DASS 21 and 69.31% had event-specific distress from mild to severe in terms of severity according to IES. Perceiving physical symptoms as COVID-19 was significantly associated with DASS stress subscale (B = 3.71, 95% CI: 1.01 to 6.40), DASS anxiety subscale (B = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.95 to 5.96), DASS depression subscale (B = 3.82, 95% CI: 0.97 to 6.67) and IES scale (B = 7.52, 95% CI: 3.58 to 11.45). Additionally, fear of infection, financial uncertainty, inadequate food supply, absence of physical exercise and limited or no recreational activity had significant association with stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms. Conclusion This COVID-19 outbreak imposes psychological consequences on people to a great extent which requires attention from the concerned authorities to cope with this situation mentally. The perception about the outbreak can also play a big role in psychological impact.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.135,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.135,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.135,2020-12-01,,,
1638,"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, and association with epidemic-related factors during the epidemic period of COVID-19 among 123,768 workers in China: A large cross-sectional study","Background COVID-19 has gained intense attention globally. However, little is known about the COVID-19-ralated mental health status among workers. Methods The cross-sectional online survey with 123,768 workers was conducted from February 2, 2020 to February 7, 2020 on a mega-size labor-intensive factory in Shenzhen, China. Oral consent was obtained prior to the questionnaire survey. The information collected in the survey included demographic characteristics, psychological symptoms, COVID-19-related information, and demands for psychological education and interventions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by the Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between related factors and mental health status. Results The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms was 3.4% and 22.8%, respectively. The dominant epidemic-related factors were having confirmed cases in the community (odds ratio [OR], 2.75, 95% CI, 2.37–3.19) and having confirmed friends (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.69–3.52) for the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. Nevertheless, major traditional risk factors such as general or poor health status and always drinking alcohol were still the dominant factors associated with the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Overall, 67.3% and 26.8% workers reported desire for psychological education and interventions, respectively. Limitations All assessments were self-reported, resulting in a risk of method bias. Conclusions Our findings show a relatively low prevalence of anxiety symptoms, a relatively high prevalence of depression symptoms, and urgent demand for psychological education and interventions among workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.041,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.041,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.041,2020-12-01,,,

1643,Changes in mental health symptoms from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 among participants with systemic sclerosis from four countries: A Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) Cohort study,"Introduction No studies have reported mental health symptom comparisons prior to and during COVID-19 in vulnerable medical populations. Objective To compare anxiety and depression symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition and factors associated with changes. Methods Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data from April 2020. Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and ≥ 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID) change for anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0; MCID = 4.0) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8; MCID = 3.0) symptoms, controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels. Results Mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to 5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2). Compared to France (N = 159), adjusted anxiety symptom change scores were significantly higher in the United Kingdom (N = 50; 3.3 points, 95% CI 0.9 to 5.6), United States (N = 128; 2.5 points, 95% CI 0.7 to 4.2), and Canada (N = 98; 1.9 points, 95% CI 0.1 to 3.8). Odds of ≥1 MCID increase were 2.6 for the United Kingdom (95% CI 1.2 to 5.7) but not significant for the United States (1.6, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.9) or Canada (1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.5). Older age and adequate financial resources were associated with less continuous anxiety increase. Employment and shorter time since diagnosis were associated with lower odds of a ≥ 1 MCID increase.

1646,Psychological distress related to COVID-19 – The contribution of continuous traumatic stress,"Objective The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a substantial stressor that could eventuate in psychological distress. Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Method An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed. Results Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS. Limitations This study relied on convenience sampling. Conclusions Trauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.141,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.141,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.141,2020-12-01,,,
1647,Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background Anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnancy typically affect between 10 and 25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. Methods We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. Results We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusion This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.126,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.126,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.126,2020-12-01,,,

1649,"Reactions to COVID-19: Differential predictors of distress, avoidance, and disregard for social distancing","Background : Recent psychological research into the effects of COVID-19 has focused largely on understanding excessive fear reactions (“over-responses”). Equally important, but neglected phenomena concern “under-responses”, in which people downplay the significance of COVID-19. People who do not take the pandemic seriously may be less likely to adhere to social distancing policies. The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the differential predictors of over- and under-responses to COVID-19. Methods : A large community sample from the United States and Canada (N = 6,854) completed measures of beliefs associated with over- and under-responses, along with measures of distress, excessive avoidance, and nonadherence to social distancing. Over-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs about the dangerousness of COVID-19 (personal health and socio-economic threats) and COVID-19-related xenophobia (beliefs that foreigners are spreading the virus). Under-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, and beliefs that one is sufficiently healthy to be robust against the effects of COVID-19. Results : In regression analyses, medium or large effects were obtained whereby over-response beliefs predicted distress (including distress associated with self-isolation) and excessive avoidance during the pandemic, whereas under-response beliefs predicted the disregard for social distancing. Limitations : This study relied on self-reported cross-sectional data and focused on extreme forms of disregard for social distancing guidelines, Conclusion : It is important to understand under-responses to COVID-19 and how these relate to distress, excessive avoidance, and nonadherence to social distancing. Implications for addressing the problems of over- and under-response are discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.002,2020-12-01,,,
1650,The first COVID-19 infanticide-suicide case: Financial crisis and fear of COVID-19 infection are the causative factors,"Background The global suicide occurrences have been aggravated because of COVID-19 crisis-related issues such as fear of infection, the financial crisis, being infected with COVID-19, loneliness, social boycott, etc. Although two studies reported about the seven dyadic suicidality cases (i.e., suicide pacts), child homicide-suicide has not been studied. Case presentation On 14 May, two dead bodies (i.e., a 30-years old Indian woman and her six-month-old baby) were found in a Riyadh apartment complex. The perpetrator (a person who kills the others and later commits suicide) – a trained nurse, was in search of a job. The woman's husband was recently retrenched from his technician job at a company in Madinah Airport. Her husband was admitted to a hospital with symptoms related to the COVID-19 infection four days before the suicide incidence. The 70-year-old mother-in-law alerted the neighbors after finding that the apartment is locked from inside and there was no response on knocking the doors. After this, the neighbors gathered and called the police. Police found two dead-bodies after opening the flat and suspected that the child was killed before the woman committed suicide. Conclusions Based on the present findings, further child filicide-suicide possibilities in families with economically distressed and/or positive COVID-19 status are expected. Hence, proper financial supports, providing authentic information (COVID-19), and mental health promotional strategies are suggested for decreasing incidences of COVID-19 related infanticide-suicide cases.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102365,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102365,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102365,2020-12-01,,,
1651,The prevalence and risk factors of psychological disturbances of frontline medical staff in china under the COVID-19 epidemic: Workload should be concerned,"Background To our best knowledge, this was the first time to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of psychological disturbances, including depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms, insomnia and suicide, among frontline medical staff, who were working with the COVID-10 infected patients directly. Methods Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire scale (GAD-7), Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90) somatization, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the suicidal module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used for online survey. Results A total of 606 frontline hospital staff and1099 general population were recruited. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms, insomnia, and suicide risk in frontline medical staffs were 57.6%, 45.4%, 12.0%, 32.0% and 13.0%, respectively. Except for suicide risk, the prevalence of other psychological disorders in frontline medical staff were higher than those in general population (all p<0.01). Among the frontline medical staff, the daily working hours were associated with all psychological disturbance (all p<0.01), women with anxiety (p = 0.02), body mass index (BMI) with anxiety and insomnia (p = 0.02, p = 0.03). Age was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia (all p<0.01). Finally, years of working and family income were negatively associated with suicide risk (p = 0.03, p<0.001). Conclusion Our study demonstrates that during the outbreak of COVID-19, the frontline medical staff are more likely to suffer from psychological disturbances than general population. It is noticeable that daily working hours are a risk factor for all measured psychological disturbances, and some other variables may be involved in certain psychological disturbances of frontline medical staff.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.059,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.059,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.059,2020-12-01,,,

1654,The prevalence and risk factors of PTSD symptoms among medical assistance workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background The outbreak of COVID 19 in December 2019 spread quickly and overwhelmed the local healthcare system of the epicenter. A total of 346 medical assistance teams with 42,600 reserve medics were mobilized from around the country for emergency assistance. This study aims to examine the incidence of mental health symptoms and predictors of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) symptoms among the reserve medics working in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province. Methods An anonymous survey was conducted from April 4–6, 2020 among the medics upon their returning home. A total of 225 surveys were returned with a response rate of 83%. The survey consisted of questionnaires about the medics' demographic information, social relations, mental health status (e.g. IES-R and DASS-21) and other work-related information. Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test and hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of PTSD symptoms. Results During the stay in Wuhan, the medics experienced high levels of depression (46.7%), anxiety (35.6%) and stress symptoms (16.0%). Upon returning home, the overall prevalence of clinically concerned PTSD symptoms was as high as 31.6%. Further analyses revealed that PTSD symptoms and its subscales were significantly associated with age, collegial relationship and mental health status during their service. Conclusion The reserve medics reported a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress as well as clinically concerned PTSD symptoms. Comprehensive screening and intervention programs should be in place to help reserve medics cope with mental health challenges and build resilience during the COVID 19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110270,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110270,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110270,2020-12-01,,,

1672,Do knowledge and attitudes matter for preventive behavioral practices toward the COVID-19? A cross-sectional online survey among the adult population in Bangladesh,"The Government of Bangladesh has adopted several non-therapeutic measures to tackle the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. However, the curve of COVID-19 positive cases has not significantly flattened yet, as the adoption of preventive measures by the general population is predominantly a behavioral phenomenon that is often influenced by people's knowledge and attitudes. This study aimed to assess the levels of knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19 and their interrelationships among the population of Bangladesh aged 18 years and above. This study adopted a web-based cross-sectional survey design and collected data from 1056 respondents using the online platform Google Form. We employed the independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's product-moment correlation, and Spearman rank-order correlation to produce the bivariate level statistics. We also run multiple linear and logistic regression models to identify the factors affecting knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19. The respondents had an average knowledge score of 17.29 (Standard Deviation (SD) = 3.30). The average score for attitude scale toward COVID-19 was 13.6 (SD = 3.7). The respondents had excellent preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19 (mean 7.7, SD = 0.72). However, this study found that knowledge and attitudes did not matter for preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19. Instead, education appeared as a sole predictor for preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19; that means preventive behavioral practices toward COVID-19 was lower among the less educated respondents. This study suggests increasing education as a long-term strategy and taking immediate action to increase knowledge and decrease negative attitudes toward COVID-19 through targeted health education initiatives as a short-term strategy.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05799,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05799,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05799,2020-12-01,,,

1677,Suicidal ideation among Bangladeshi university students early during the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence estimates and correlates,"Lockdown, social isolation, and interruption of daily life during the COVID-19 period have impacted many lives. University students are particularly vulnerable to such disruptions and may be particularly disposed to suicidal ideation, potentially creating a new public health crisis. This study aimed to assess suicidal ideation and associated factors among university students in Bangladesh during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using the Google form (Google survey tool) from April to May 2020. Initially, 3366 respondents voluntarily completed the survey form. Finally, 3331 surveys were included in the final analyses after removing incomplete surveys. The data ware reviewed, rechecked, and analyzed with SPSS (25.0 version) software. A total of 1979 (59.4%) males and 1352 (40.6%) females participated. Respondents were between the ages of 18 to 28 years (mean age 21.4 years [SD = 1.9]). The prevalence estimate of suicidal ideation was 12.8%. Potential risk factors included less sleep, excess sleep, cigarette smoking, past suicidal thoughts, suicide attempt history, family history of suicidality, depression, anxiety, and stress. Potential protective factors included being male, having lower SES, living in rural areas, regular physical exercise, and satisfactory study. Suicidal ideation was prevalent among Bangladeshi university students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the correlates of suicidal ideation may aid to develop targeted strategies to support students during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105703,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105703,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105703,2020-12-01,,,

Methods All eligible patients were contacted by phone by trained physicians and were asked to answer to a dedicated questionnaire. Patients managed in hospital ward without needing intensive care were compared with those who were transferred in intensive care units (ICU). Results We included 120 patients after a mean (±SD) of 110.9 (±11.1) days following admission. The most frequently reported persistent symptoms were fatigue (55%), dyspnoea (42%), loss of memory (34%), concentration and sleep disorders (28% and 30.8%, respectively). Comparisons between ward- and ICU patients led to no statistically significant differences regarding those symptoms. In both group, EQ-5D (mobility, self-care, pain, anxiety or depression, usual activity) was altered with a slight difference in pain in the ICU group. Conclusion Most patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 still have persistent symptoms. While there were few differences between HRQoL between ward and ICU patients, our findings must be confirmed in larger cohorts, including more severe patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.08.029,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.08.029,Scopus,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.08.029,2020-12-01,,,

1704,Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on ICU Caregivers,"Subject and purpose Just as every pandemic, COVID-19 could lead to emotional and psychological disturbances among caregivers, especially in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where significant stress related to the influx of patients, exposure to the virus and the lack of documentation on this new SARS occurred. The present study aimed at assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the caregivers at the peak of the “crisis period”. Materials and methods A survey using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R) was proposed to the persons working in 5 ICUs of a French teaching hospital (8th of April to the 21st of April 2020). Logistic regression was performed to find independent risk factors for anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results The incidence of anxiety and depression were 48% and 16%, respectively. PTSD symptoms were present in 27% of respondents. The independent risk factors for developing anxiety syndrome were being assigned in COVID-19 + ICU (OR = 2.081 [95% confident interval (CI), 1.035-4.184)], and not be trained in intensive care medicine, OR = 2.570 [95% CI, 1.344-4.901]. The independent risk factors for PTSD are having a history of burn-out (OR = 4.591 [95% CI, 1.464-14.397] and not being trained in ICU, (OR = 2.155 [95% CI, 1.047-4.440]). Conclusion COVID-19 could have a strong impact on ICU workers. These findings should lead to prevention procedures (ICU training sessions) in persons at risk.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2020.08.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2020.08.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.accpm.2020.08.006,2020-12-01,,,

1709,Burnout and Associated Factors Among Health Care Workers in Singapore During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objectives The strain on health care systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased psychological distress among health care workers (HCWs). As this global crisis continues with little signs of abatement, we examine burnout and associated factors among HCWs. Design Cross-sectional survey study. Setting and Participants Doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, administrative, and support staff in 4 public hospitals and 1 primary care service in Singapore 3 months after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Methods Study questionnaire captured demographic and workplace environment information and comprised 3 validated instruments, namely the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Multivariate mixed model regression analyses were used to evaluate independent associations of mean OLBI-Disengagement and -Exhaustion scores. Further subgroup analysis was performed among redeployed HCWs. Results Among 11,286 invited HCWs, 3075 valid responses were received, giving an overall response rate of 27.2%. Mean OLBI scores were 2.38 and 2.50 for Disengagement and Exhaustion, respectively. Burnout thresholds in Disengagement and Exhaustion were met by 79.7% and 75.3% of respondents, respectively. On multivariate regression analysis, Chinese or Malay ethnicity, HADS anxiety or depression scores ≥8, shifts lasting ≥8 hours, and being redeployed were significantly associated with higher OLBI mean scores, whereas high SAQ scores were significantly associated with lower scores. Among redeployed HCWs, those redeployed to high-risk areas in a different facility (offsite) had lower burnout scores than those redeployed within their own work facility (onsite). A higher proportion of HCWs redeployed offsite assessed their training to be good or better compared with those redeployed onsite. Conclusions and Implications Every level of the health care workforce is susceptible to high levels of burnout during this pandemic. Modifiable workplace factors include adequate training, avoiding prolonged shifts ≥8 hours, and promoting safe working environments. Mitigating strategies should target every level of the health care workforce, including frontline and nonfrontline staff. Addressing and ameliorating burnout among HCWs should be a key priority for the sustainment of efforts to care for patients in the face of a prolonged pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.035,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.035,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.035,2020-12-01,,,

1721,Emotion recognition changes in a confinement situation due to COVID-19,"The confinement situation experienced as a result of COVID-19 will have consequences at a psychological level. These consequences can affect emotion recognition because, due to isolation, interactions and social contacts have been drastically reduced. The aim of this study was to find out if there were differences in facial emotion recognition in two groups of young adults, one confined during COVID-19 and the other unconfined. One hundred and sixty-four young adults were tested twice, the first time unconfined, to obtain the baseline, then the sample was divided into two subgroups so that 84 were evaluated in a confined situation and 80 in an unconfined situation. . Ekman 60 Faces test, which includes the recognition of the six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) was applied. The main results obtained showed that during the confinement situation there was a significant decrease in the recognition of happiness, and a significant increase in the recognition of sadness and depressed mood. Confinement significantly alters and reduces our social interactions, which can affect our mood as well as our emotional facial recognition. For this reason, health services need to engage in early detection of the psychological effects this situation will have on the population.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101518,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101518,Scopus,10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101518,2020-12-01,,,

We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N = 412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N = 292) and Latin-America (N = 120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others. Results suggest that optimists, those with high level of general trust and those who do not believe in conspiracy theories show lower level of fear and higher level of preventive behaviors. Pessimists on the other hand, show higher level of fear.

Together with psychological factors related to information processing we link these prospects to financial well-being. We find that, although generally very pessimistic, a substantial proportion of individuals believes that their households’ economy will be doing substantially better than the national and global economy, suggesting a “financial better-than-average” effect. Furthermore, we find that the pessimism regarding future household economic situation and being financially ignorant are associated with decreased financial well-being, while the (inter)national economic situation is not.

1733,"Knowledge, attitudes and mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","Background Little is known about the psychological impact of COVID-19 on university students during the disease outbreak in China, but this information is important for the development of services to support these students who are typically in their early 20s. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine university students' knowledge, attitudes, and mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods On February 10, 2020 and during the second week of national lockdown, 511 students from a university in China were assessed using the COVID-19 General Information Questionnaire and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) questionnaire. To understand the mental health status of the current sample, we compared it with the normal population. Results Four hundred and seventy-two valid questionnaires were collected. In total, 11% of respondents reported confirmed COVID-19 cases in their hometowns or communities. In view of students' knowledge about COVID-19, 56% had sufficient knowledge of typical symptoms of COVID-19, and 41% knew a lot about prevention methods for the future pandemic. In terms of the risk perceptions, 57% had experienced considerable fear of this disease, and 19% perceived a high risk of becoming infected. In terms of attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic, 63% felt positive about its development (i.e., it was generally under control), and 92% declared that they were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The scores for somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and the general severity index were significantly increased compared with the norm (p < 0.001). However, no differences in the scores for depression, hostility and psychoticism were noted (p > 0.05). Conclusion University students possessed insufficient COVID-19 knowledge and high-risk perceptions. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mental health of university students. Social support and targeted interventions tailored to university students should be provided during such an outbreak, and university administration should strengthen the cultivation of students' mental toughness using standard teaching processes.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105494,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105494,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105494,2020-12-01,,,

The study aimed to explore such an impact on mental health among Bangladeshi students and their perception towards the COVID-19 pandemic. A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 589 students from Bangladesh in between April 29th to 7th May 2020. Data was collected by using an online questionnaire on demographic status, perceptions towards COVID-19, and mental health symptoms by using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21). About 26.66% and 61.97% of students reported mild to extremely severe anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms, respectively, and 57.05% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Multivariate logistic regression reported that students’ age, gender, family income, residence, and family size are associated with mental health difficulties.

1749,Problematic internet use among young and adult population in Bangladesh: Correlates with lifestyle and online activities during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background Although internet use can boost individuals’ quality of life in various aspects, activities on the internet (e.g., gambling, video gaming, social media use, pornography use, etc.) can be used as coping strategy to deal with psychological stressors and mood states (e.g., fear, anxiety, depression) particularly during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives The present study assessed problematic internet use (PIU) among Bangladeshi youth and adults in Bangladesh and examined its correlation with lifestyle and online activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was utilized between May and June 2020 comprising 13,525 Bangladeshi individuals (61.3% male; age range 18–50 years; mean age 23.7 years) recruited from various online platforms. The self-report survey included questions concerning socio-demographics, lifestyle, and online activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as psychometric scales such as the nine-item Internet Disorder Scale-Short Form (IDS9-SF). Results Utilizing hierarchical regression analysis, problematic internet use was significantly and positively associated with those who were younger, having a higher level of education, living with a nuclear family, engaging in less physical exercise, avoiding household chores, playing online videogames, social media use, and engaging in recreational online activities. Conclusions Excessive internet use appears to have been commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic period and young adults were most vulnerable to problematic internet use.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100311,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100311,Scopus,10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100311,2020-12-01,,,

1756,Introduction to the special issue on the HEALing Communities Study,"The severity of the overdose epidemic underscores the urgent need for innovative and high impact interventions that promote the rapid penetration and scale up of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in communities profoundly affected by fatal opioid overdose. This special issue shares scientific advancements in implementation research design and evaluation of a novel data-driven community-based intervention. The HEALing (Helping End Addiction Long-Term) Communities Study (HCS) is a four-year study that is designed to examine the effectiveness of the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention. The CTH intervention supports the dissemination of EBPs in 67 communities across four high-burdened states—Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. The diversity in these communities in terms of rural-urban status, race-ethnicity and other social determinants of health facilitates generalizability of results to other communities across the US. The nine papers in this special issue describe critical elements that constitute the HCS framework and design. This includes the implementation of EBPs that have a substantial impact on fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose, the Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach, communication campaigns to increase awareness and demand for EBPs and reduce stigma against people with OUD and MOUD interventions, and the process of community engagement. This includes how to form community coalitions and gain their commitment, and steps taken to mobilize coalitions to pursue EBP implementation and ensure EBPs are adapted for community needs. The collective papers in this issue demonstrate that the design of any complex study must adapt to unanticipated temporal events, including the rapidly emerging COVID-19 crisis. Readers will learn about the scientific process of the design and implementation of a community-engaged intervention, its methodologies, guiding conceptual models, and research implementation strategies that can be applied to address other health issues.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108327,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108327,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108327,2020-12-01,,,
1757,Child Maltreatment during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Consequences of Parental Job Loss on Psychological and Physical Abuse Towards Children,"Background Job loss resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risk for child abuse. Protective factors, such as reframing coping, may mitigate the risk of job loss on child maltreatment. Objective The current study investigated factors associated with child maltreatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, including parental job loss, and whether cognitive reframing moderated associations between job loss and child maltreatment. Method A community sample of 342 parents (62% mothers) of 4- to 10-year-olds (M = 7.38, SD = 2.01; 57.3% male) living in the United States completed online questionnaires regarding experiences with COVID-19, the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale, and the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales. Results Two logistic regression analyses evaluated predictors of whether parents psychologically maltreated or physically abused their children during the pandemic controlling for maltreating history, parental depressive symptoms, financial stability, parent age, parent gender, child age, and child gender. Parents who lost their jobs (OR = 4.86, 95% CI [1.19, 19.91], p = .03), were more depressed (OR = 1.05, 95% CI [1.02, 1.08], p < .01), and previously psychologically maltreated their children (OR = 111.94, 95% CI [28.54, 439.01], p < .001) were more likely to psychologically maltreat during the pandemic. Regarding physical abuse, a significant interaction between job loss and reframing coping emerged (OR = 0.76, 95% CI [0.59, 0.99], p = .04). Among parents who lost their jobs, the probability of physical abuse decreased as reframing coping increased. Conclusions Job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant risk factor for child maltreatment. Reframing coping may be an important buffer of this association on physical abuse and presents implications for maltreatment prevention.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104709,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104709,Scopus,10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104709,2020-12-01,,,

1761,Psychological health problems during the lockdown: A survey of Indian population in COVID-19 pandemic,"The global crisis prevailing in the wake of the spread of COVID-19 has raised several speculations about the impact of the lockdown on the mental health of people. The dataset presented here is the assessment of the psychological distress experienced by people in India following the implementation of lockdown as a measure to curtail the spread of the coronavirus. The data was collected through a survey conducted by employing an online questionnaire assessing the socio-demographic information (9-items) as well as the administration of the short version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12 items) originally developed by Goldberg (1972). The period of data collection is between 9th April 2020 and 20th April 2020 where a total of 1,894 responses were obtained. The Google forms containing the questionnaire of the study were shared publicly through emails and via the social media forum like WhatsApp and Facebook. Thereby, those who took the initiative to fill-up the responses were included as the survey participants. Thus, the final sample had participants representing 17 states and Union territories of India. The entire dataset is stored in a Microsoft Excel Worksheet (.xls) and the questionnaire is attached as a supplementary file. The data is beneficial for the timely assessment of the nature and degree of the psychological distress experienced by people in India during the COVID-19 crisis.

1764,The role of physical activity on mental health and quality of life during COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-sectional study,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has placed restrictions on people's physical activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical activity levels of individuals and assess the effects of physical activity on quality of life, depression and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods This cross-sectional study were included 2301 participants aged 20–75 years. The data were collected through the Google Forms web survey platform by the virtual snowball sampling method. In the multivariate analysis, the independent predictors were analyzed using possible factors identified in previous analyses by multinomial logistic regression analysis. Hosmer–Lemeshow and Omnibus tests were used to evaluate the logistic regression model and coefficients. Results The mean weekly energy consumption of the participants was 875±1588 MET-min, and only 6.9% were physically active enough to maintain their health. There was a weak positive relationship between physical activity levels and quality of life, while there was a weak negative relationship between physical activity levels, depression and anxiety (p<0.05). In the multinomial logistic regression model established for comparison of physically active and inactive participants, general health status and physical health status variables were statistically significant (p<0.05). However, relationships between psychological status, social relationships and environment scores, Beck Depression and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Conclusions Results showed that physical activity programs should be included in guidelines as an integrative approach to pandemic management. During COVID-19 outbreak, community-based rehabilitation programs are needed, and these programs should be carried out in cooperation with community stakeholders.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101248,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101248,Scopus,10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101248,2020-12-01,,,

Methods Cross-sectional study based on an online snowball recruiting questionnaire. Psychological correlates assessed with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale (IES). Binary and multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify risk and protective factors. Results Final sample included 2,194 individuals aged 60 years or more (mean age [SD]: 65.62 [5.05]; females: 1,198 [54.6%]). There were 342 (15.6%) individuals who reported a PMD and 162 (7.4%) who reported a CMD. Avoidant (32.1%) and depressive (25.6%) styles were the most prevalent, regardless of mental health status. Main risk factors for negative affectivity were female gender and history CMD or PMD. However, job stability and the ability to enjoy free time were generally associated with better outcomes. No differences were found in psychological correlates between those with no lifetime history of mental disorder versus PMD on the DASS-21 or IES. However, CMD was associated with higher anxiety scores on the DASS-21 (odds ratio: 1.838, p < .001). Conclusion Regardless of mental status, avoidant and depressive styles were the most prevalent in this older adult sample. Main protective factor in all subgroups was the ability to enjoy free time, whereas the main risk factors were being female and current or past history of mental disorder.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.09.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.09.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.09.005,2020-12-01,,,

1771,COVID-19 humor in Jordanian social media: A socio-semiotic approach,"The Coronavirus has wrapped the whole universe with a mood of fear, depression, anxiety and loss of hope. It has made countries of the world, west and east, rich and poor, advanced and underdeveloped, all engaged in a common task: facing one ‘invisible’ enemy; the pandemic. The consequences are conditions that, the UN states, have not been experienced since the horrific conditions of World War II resulting into heavy toils in the number of victims. The normal course of life has now changed. The pressing demand is the adaptation to various new measures including curfews and the restrictions on mass mobility. These conditions managed to alter the long-established rhythm of daily course of life. This paper focuses on how Jordanian social media is contributing in overcoming Pandemic anxiety burdens and offering relief. For this purpose, the study undertakes a two-track task. A survey is compiled to elicit social media users' opinions concerning the effect of humor on people's well-being. Participants were given questions on humor and were also asked to give their impressions on a selection of 20 humorous figures attached as a link within the survey. 1274 participants responded. Likert's five-point scale was adapted to analyze the data. Second, the paper examined these twenty selected memes and caricatures extracted from Jordanian social media websites. The study applied Kress and Leeuween's approach of social semiotics. The objective is to identify and analyze specific semiotic patterns in COVID-19 related caricatures and memes in Jordanian social media in order to demonstrate how humor can be used as means of softening the grim mood created by the Pandemic through examining the data from a social-semiotic perspective.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05696,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05696,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05696,2020-12-01,,,

1773,The relationship between social networking sites usage and psychological distress among undergraduate students during COVID-19 lockdown,"During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, interpersonal interactions are restricted to social networks. Undergraduate students are isolated in their homes and dorms. Loneliness is closely related to psychological distress. Fear of contracting the disease will worsen psychological distress. The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among undergraduate students and their relationships with social networking sites usage during the COVID-19 lockdown. An online survey was used to recruit 456 participants for this cross-sectional descriptive study. Self-reported questionnaires were used to collect data on students' demographics, depression, anxiety, stress, and social networking usage. The results revealed that the majority of students had symptoms of depression (74.1%), anxiety (59.6%), and stress (61.2%). Female students had higher depression and anxiety symptoms than males. Senior-level students' psychological distress symptoms were significantly different from those of junior level. The largest percentage of students (91.9%) used social networking sites for entertainment. The academic usage of social networking sites was negatively (p < .05) correlated with depression and stress scores, while entertainment usage was positively correlated with anxiety. Age was not found to be significantly correlated with psychological distress. Academic and entertainment use of social networking sites were successfully associated with psychological distress symptoms after controlling for demographics. During this unprecedented time of undergraduate students’ course of study, they were experiencing higher than average distress symptoms. These symptoms could be mitigated by continuing the regular academic activities and delivering the most accurate up-to-date information on the COVID-19 through social networking sites.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05695,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05695,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05695,2020-12-01,,,

1777,"Distant from others, but close to home: The relationship between home attachment and mental health during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant consequences for Americans' daily lives. Many people are spending more time in their homes due to work from home arrangements, stay at home orders, and closures of businesses and public gathering spaces. In this study, we explored how one's attachment to their home may help to buffer their mental health during this stressful time. Data were collected from a three-wave, longitudinal sampling (n=289) surveyed at baseline, two, and four weeks after. We found a clear relationship between an individual's attachment to home and positive mental health. Across all three waves, home attachment was negatively associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, participants' home attachment at baseline was predictive of subsequent mental health two weeks after, which suggests that one's relationship to their home was particularly important during the initial onset of the national response to the outbreak. Predictors of home attachment included conscientiousness, agreeableness, and restorative ambience. Over the course of the study, kinship ambience also emerged as a predictor of home attachment. In the midst of increased mental health concerns and limited resources due to COVID-19, the home may buffer some individuals from depressive and anxiety-related symptoms by functioning as a source of refuge, security, and stability.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101516,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101516,Scopus,10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101516,2020-12-01,,,

1784,The Prevalence and Predictors of Post-Stroke Depression and Anxiety During COVID-19 Pandemic,"Introduction Stroke is associated with a rise in post-stroke depression (PSD) and anxiety (PSA). In this study, we evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the rates of PSD and PSA. Methods All stroke admissions to two hospitals in Saudi Arabia during two months were prospectively evaluated for PSD and PSA. NIHSS and serum TSH assessed on admission. PSD and PSA were evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Post-stroke disability was assessed by mRS, while social support assessed by Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Results Among 50 participants (28 males), clinically significant PSD was found in 36%, while PSA in 32%. PSD associated with higher NIHSS (P < 0.001); lower MSPSS (P = 0.003); higher mRS (P = 0.001); and discontinuation of rehabilitation (P = 0.02). PSA was associated with higher TSH (P = 0.01); lower MSPSS (P = 0.03); while discontinuation of rehabilitation was related to less PSA (P = 0.034). Multivariate analysis showed that NIHSS (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 742–3.37; P = 0.01); and MSPSS score (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47–0.94; P = 0.002) were associated with PSD; while PSA was related to TSH level (OR: 8.32, 95% CI:1.42–47.23; P = 0.02), and discontinuation of rehabilitation (OR: -0.96, 95% CI: -1.90–0.02; P = 0.04). Conclusions Our research shows that the rise in PSD is related to stroke severity and this has not changed significantly during the pandemic; however, PSA showed a noticeable peak. Social deprivation and the lacking levels of rehabilitation related significantly to both.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105315,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105315,Scopus,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105315,2020-12-01,,,
1785,Experimental Model to Test Electrostatic Precipitation Technology in the COVID-19 Era: A Pilot Study,"Background In the COVID-19 crisis, laparoscopic surgery is in focus as a relevant source of bioaerosol release. The efficacy of electrostatic aerosol precipitation (EAP) and continuous aerosol evacuation (CAE) to eliminate bioaerosols during laparoscopic surgery was verified. Study design Ex-vivo laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LCs) were simulated ± EAP or CAE in Pelvitrainer equipped with swine gallbladders. Release of bioaerosols was initiated by performing high-frequency electrosurgery with a monopolar electro hook (MP-HOOK) force at 40 watts (MP-HOOK40) and 60 watts (MP-HOOK60), as well as by ultrasonic cutting (USC). Particle number concentrations (PNC) of arising aerosols were analyzed with a condensation particle counter (CPC). Aerosol samples were taken within the Pelvitrainer close to the source, outside the Pelvitrainer at the working trocar, and in the breathing zone of the surgeon. Results Within the Pelvitrainer, MP-HOOK40 (6.4 × 105 cm-3) and MP-HOOK60 (7.3 × 105 cm-3) showed significantly higher median PNCs compared to USC (4.4 × 105 cm-3) (p = 0.001). EAP led to a significant decrease of the median PNCs in all 3 groups. A high linear correlation with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.852, 0.825, and 0.759 were observed by comparing MP-HOOK40 (± EAP), MP-HOOK60 (± EAP), and USC (± EAP), respectively. During ex-vivo LC and CAE, significant bioaerosol contaminations of the operating room occurred. Ex-vivo LC with EAP led to a considerable reduction of the bioaerosol concentration. Conclusions EAP was found to be efficient for intraoperative bioaerosol elimination and reducing the risk of bioaerosol exposure for surgical staff.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.08.759,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.08.759,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.08.759,2020-12-01,,,

1787,Anxiety among young adults and the elderly during the lockdown for SARS-CoV2,"Chez le sujet âgé, certains troubles tels que la dépression sont difficiles à diagnostiquer et ont un aspect différent de la pathologie qui survient chez le jeune adulte. Nous nous sommes consacrés dans cette étude à évaluer le niveau de l’anxiété à travers la somatisation chez les participants afin de mettre en évidence la différence entre l’anxiété chez le jeune adulte et l’anxiété chez le sujet âgé. Cette étude est une suite à la publication concernant une nouvelle échelle de somatisation. Les analyses statistiques ont été faites sur la même population. Ce travail a été réalisé à l’aide de l’échelle de somatisation sur un échantillon de 235 participants ayant plus de 18 ans. Ces participants étaient des hommes et femmes qui ont été confinés au Maroc lors de la pandémie du SARS-CoV2. Nous avons constaté que les jeunes adultes présentaient une anxiété plus intense que les sujets âgés au cours de cette période de confinement et que les sujets âgés étaient plus nombreux à ressentir de l’anxiété dite « normale » suite à la pandémie du COVID-19. Among the elderly, certain disorders such as depression are difficult to diagnose and have a different aspect from the pathology occurring in young adults. In this study, we set out to assess levels of anxiety via somatization among the participants in order to highlight any differences between anxiety among young adults and anxiety among the elderly. This study is a follow-up to a previously published report on a newly established somatization scale. The statistical analyses were carried out on the same population. This work used the somatization scale on a sample of 235 participants over the age of 18. The participants were men and women who were subjected to lockdown in Morocco during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. We found that young adults exhibited more intense anxiety than the elderly during this period of confinement and that the elderly subjects were more likely to experience so-called “normal” anxiety following the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.npg.2020.08.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.npg.2020.08.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.npg.2020.08.005,2020-12-01,,,

1792,Dying alone and lonely dying: Media discourse and pandemic conditions,"Background and objectives This paper explores current concerns and practice related to older people dying alone in Intensive Care Units, care homes, and at home through media discussions during the Covid-19 pandemic and before. It addresses the historically-situated concept of a good death and a bad death and suggests why dying alone, whether completely alone or without significant others physically present, may be considered a bad death. Methods As evidence for collective fears about dying alone, we explored the treatment of these deaths in media using headline examples from the US New York Times and the English Guardian newspaper from the 19th century through Sept. 2020. Results A search of the New York Times located 39 articles with either lonely dying or lonely death in the headline. The Guardian had 25 articles with use of the term, but unlike the New York Times, no obituaries were included. Although the deaths profiled were deemed unusual, deaths by suicide were only minimally classed as dying alone. The condition of dying alone is represented as a stigmatised death. Themes addressed: 1) dying alone is a nonnormative event; 2) this death matters; and 3) where people die alone, societies should honour the death and learn from it. Discussion and implications Contemporary dying involves conditions for which we are unprepared as a society. We seldom address our civic obligations to each other. Few people have discussed their wishes about their preferences in dying and whether and how they want to be accompanied at their death, if possible. This is an invisible constraint of modern healthcare. Because of limited discussions and preparation, these deaths may lead to disenfranchised grief for the mourners. Cultural and societal responses to lonely dying are important in easing the emotional burden of dying alone, helping individuals prepare for this possibility and better integrating death with the life course. Recommendations include inclusion of accompaniment/nonaccompaniment at death as part of advance care planning and mitigation if this condition occurs. It is essential for individuals to find their own still point of acceptance within competing societal narratives of privileging the self in dying alone and the value of social connection.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2020.100878,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2020.100878,Scopus,10.1016/j.jaging.2020.100878,2020-12-01,,,

1798,Synergistic path planning of multi-UAVs for air pollution detection of ships in ports,"The phenomena of the COVID-19 outbreak and the Arctic Iceberg melting over the past two years make us reconsider the impact our way of life has on the environment and the responsibility of business toward minimizing and potentially eliminating emissions. Increasing ship traffic in ports leads to the growing emission of air pollutants, which influences the air quality and public health in the surrounding areas. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted relevant regulations (e.g., Annex VI of IMO's pollution prevention treaty (MARPOL) and mandatory energy-efficiency measures) to address ship emissions. To ensure the effective implementation of such regulations and measures, air emission detection and monitoring has become crucial. In this paper, a dynamic multitarget path planning model is developed to realize multi-UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) performing synergistic detection of ship emissions in ports. A path planning algorithm under a dynamic environment is developed to establish the model. This algorithm incorporates a Tabu table into particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve its optimization ability, and it obtains the initial detection route of each UAV based on a “minimum ring” method. This paper describes a multi-UAVs synergistic algorithm to formulate the path reprogramming time in a dynamic environment by judging and cutting the “minimum ring”. This finding proves the improved efficiency of air pollution detection by UAVs. It provides useful insights for maritime and port authorities to detect ship emissions in practice and to ensure ship emission reduction for better air quality in the postpandemic era.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.102128,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.102128,Scopus,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102128,2020-12-01,,,

El objetivo del presente estudio fue analizar el estado emocional de los trabajadores del Hospital de Igualada (Barcelona), mientras se enfrentaban a uno de los focos de contagio más importantes de Europa. Pacientes y métodos Se incluyó a un total de 395 trabajadores. Se realizó una evaluación transversal entre los meses de marzo y abril. Se recogió información sobre síntomas de ansiedad, depresión, estrés. También se recogieron datos demográficos y sobre factores potencialmente estresantes. Resultados Un porcentaje significativo de profesionales reportó síntomas de ansiedad (71,6%) y depresión (60,3%). El 14,5% informó de síntomas de estrés agudo. Se realizó un análisis de regresión que explicó el 30% de la variancia asociada al nivel de malestar emocional (Ry=0,30). Los factores de riesgo asociados a mayor malestar psicológico fueron el hecho de ser mujer (o hombre joven), trabajar como auxiliar de enfermería, celador o técnico de radiología, estar en contacto directo con pacientes Covid-19, no haber realizado la PCR, tener la sensación de no contar con los elementos de protección personales y haber experimentado la muerte de una persona cercana por Covid-19. Conclusiones El afrontamiento inicial de la situación de crisis asociada a la pandemia de Covid-19 tuvo un importante impacto emocional en los profesionales sanitarios analizados. Background and objectives The Covid-19 pandemic has put healthcare professionals around the world in an unprecedented challenge. This may cause some emotional difficulties and mental health problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. Patients and methods A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. Results A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (Ry=0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress.

1831,Undergraduate neuroscience education: Meeting the challenges of the 21st century,The dedication of undergraduate neuroscience faculty to their students could not have been more evident than what these educators demonstrated when the COVID-19 pandemic impacted colleges and universities across the United States. These faculty faced the crisis head-on to provide their students with exceptional instruction in virtual formats that many faculty had never used for instruction before the pandemic. This same tenacious attitude has been reflected in pedagogical efforts that undergraduate neuroscience faculty have undertaken since the mid-1990s. The challenges of providing cutting-edge neuroscience education to undergraduates in a dynamic field have produced a series of curricular designs and approaches that capitalize on discipline-based education research. This article reviews curricular models and pedagogical strategies aimed at enhancing the educational experiences of undergraduate neuroscience students whose lived experiences and academic backgrounds reflect the richly kaleidoscopic demographics of college students in the 21st century. The future of undergraduate neuroscience education is bright as faculty and their students collaborate on their journey of discovery in neuroscience.,,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135418,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135418,Scopus,10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135418,2020-11-20,,,

1909,The psychological status of 8817 hospital workers during COVID-19 Epidemic: A cross-sectional study in Chongqing,"Background There was an outbreak of COVID-19 towards the end of 2019 in China, which spread all over the world rapidly. The Chinese healthcare system is facing a big challenge where hospital workers are experiencing enormous psychological pressure. This study aimed to (1) investigate the psychological status of hospital workers and (2) provide references for psychological crisis intervention in the future. Method An online survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic features, epidemic-related factors, results of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PHQ-15, suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI), and the score of stress and support scales. Chi-square test, t-test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect the risk factors to psychological effect and SSI. Results 8817 hospital workers participated in this online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and SSI were 30.2%, 20.7%, 46.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that female, single, Tujia minority, educational background of junior or below, designated or county hospital, need for psychological assistance before or during the epidemic, unconfident about defeating COVID-19, ignorance about the epidemic, willingness of attending parties, and poor self-rated health condition were independent factors associated with high-level depression, somatic symptom, and SSI among hospital workers (P<0.05). Limitations This cross-sectional study cannot reveal the causality, and voluntary participation could be prone to selection bias. A modified epidemic-related stress and support scale without standardization was used. The number of hospital workers in each hospital was unavailable. Conclusion There were a high level of psychological impact and SSI among hospital workers, which needed to be addressed. County hospital workers were more severe and easier to be neglected. More studies on cognitive and behavioral subsequence after a public health disaster among hospital workers are needed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.092,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.092,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.092,2020-11-01,,,

1913,The possible immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in coronavirus disease patients,"While researchers are struggling to develop a vaccine for coronavirus disease, it is important to evolve effective therapeutic strategies to save lives. The majority of coronavirus disease deaths are due to pneumonia. Mostly, stress and depression are associated with coronavirus disease infection and thus, resulting in weakening of patients’ immune response and hence, more severe respiratory symptoms or even death. We propose using a class of antidepressants named selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for their reported potential antiviral effect, modulatory effect of respiratory symptoms, antioxidant properties and immunoregulatory effects beside their main action as antidepressant. In addition, the low cost of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might add a benefit for coronavirus disease patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110140,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110140,Scopus,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110140,2020-11-01,,,

1938,Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of Coronavirus Disease-2019: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae,"Background Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the coronavirus disease-2019. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. Objective: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Methods A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Results First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of “psychosis after chloroquine.” Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. Conclusion The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022,Scopus,10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022,2020-11-01,,,

1958,"The psychological impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic on hospital workers in Daegu, South Korea","Objective This study aimed to assess the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by healthcare workers and other personnel during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Method The sample consisted of 2554 hospital workers (i.e., physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and auxiliary staff members) who were working in Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, South Korea. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was administered to the hospital workers twice over a 2 week interval. A high-risk group, identified on the basic of first total IES-R, was assessed further with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGIS) scale and was offered periodic psychiatric consultations on a telephone. Results The participating nurses and auxiliary staff members had significantly higher IES-R scores (p < 0.01) than the physicians. During the second evaluation, the IES-R scores of the high-risk participants had decreased by 13.67 ± 16.15 points (p < 0.01), and their CGI-S scores had decreased by 1.00 ± 0.74 points (p < 0.01). The psychological symptoms of the high-risk group who received telephone-based psychiatric consultation showed improvement after 2 weeks. Conclusions The present findings suggest that hospital workers experience high levels of emotional stress during a pandemic. In particular, the present findings underscore the need to provide more information and support to nurses and other administrative workers. There is a need for greater awareness about the importance of mental health care among hospital workers, and rapid and ongoing psychiatric interventions should be provided to workers during the pandemic period.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152213,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152213,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152213,2020-11-01,,,

1967,Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the quality of life for women with ovarian cancer,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for the oncology community. For people living with cancer, treatments are interrupted, surgeries cancelled, and regular oncology evaluations rescheduled. People with cancer and their physicians must balance plausible fears of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer treatment with the consequences of delaying cancer care. Objective We aim to evaluate the experience of women with ovarian cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Study Design Women with a current or previous diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on treatment interruptions and quality of life. The quality of life was measured with the Cancer Worry Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the effect of participant characteristics on quality of life survey scores. Results A total of 603 women, from 41 states, visited the survey website between March 30, 2020, and April 13, 2020, and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. The median age was 58 years (range, 20–85). At the time of survey completion, 217 participants (43.3%) were in active treatment. A total of 175 participants (33%) experienced a delay in some component of their cancer care. Ten (26.3%) of the 38 participants scheduled for surgery experienced a delay, as did 18 (8.3%) of the 217 participants scheduled for nonsurgical cancer treatment. A total of 133 participants (24.0%) had a delayed physician appointment, 84 (15.1%) laboratory tests, and 53 (9.6%) cancer-related imaging. Among the cohort, 88.6% (489) reported significant cancer worry, 51.4% (285) borderline or abnormal anxiety, and 26.5% (147) borderline or abnormal depression. On univariate analysis, age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer treatment or cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine were all associated with higher levels of cancer worry. Higher anxiety scores were associated with age less than 65 years and being self-described as immunocompromised. Higher depression scores were associated with age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine. On multivariable linear regression analysis, age less than 65 and being self-described as immunocompromised were independently predictive of greater cancer worry, anxiety, and depression, and delay in cancer care was predictive of anxiety and depression. Conclusion The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is affecting care of patients with ovarian cancer; surgeries, treatments, scheduled physician appointments, laboratory tests, and imaging are cancelled or delayed. Younger age, presumed immunocompromise, and delay in cancer care were associated with significantly higher levels of cancer worry, anxiety, and depression. Providers must work with patients to balance competing risks of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer, recognizing that communication is a critical clinical tool to improve quality of life in these times.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.049,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.049,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.049,2020-11-01,,,

1986,Follow up of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease sequelae,"Background Since December 2019 the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been burdening all health systems worldwide. However, pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 after recovery from the acute disease are unknown. Material and methods Hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation were included and followed 6 weeks after discharge. Body plethysmography, lung diffusion capacity (DLco), blood gas analysis (ABG), 6-min walk test (6MWT), echocardiography, and laboratory tests were performed. Quality of life (QoL), depression, and anxiety were assessed using validated questionnaires. Results 33 patients with severe disease were included. Patients were discharged without prophylactic anticoagulation. At follow-up there were no thromboembolic complications in any patient. 11 patients (33%) had dyspnea, 11 (33%) had cough, and 15 (45%) suffered from symptoms of fatigue. Pulmonary function tests including ABG did not reveal any limitations (TLC: median=94% of predicted {IQR:85-105}; VC: 93% {78-101}; FEV1: 95% {72-103}; FEV1/FVC 79% {76-85}; PaO2: 72 mmHg {67-79}; PaCO2: 38 mmHg {35-38}), except for slightly reduced DLco (77% {69-95}). There were no echocardiographic impairments. 6MWT distance was reduced in most patients without oxygen desaturation. According to standardized questionnaires, patients suffered from reduced QoL, mainly due to decreased mobility (SGRQ activity score: 54 {19-78}). There were no indicators for depression or anxiety (PHQ-9: 7 {4-11}, GAD-7: 4 {1-9}, respectively). Conclusions Hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, who did not require mechanical ventilation, are unlikely to develop pulmonary long-term impairments, thromboembolic complications or cardiac impairments after discharge but frequently suffer from symptoms of fatigue.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106197,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106197,Scopus,10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106197,2020-11-01,,,

1990,Investigation on sleep and mental health of patients with Parkinson's disease during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is adversely affecting sleep quality and mental health, especially in individuals with chronic disease such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods We conducted a quantitative study, which included 119 Chinese PD patients who had been treated in an outpatient neurology clinic in Wuhan and 169 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The questionnaire survey focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep, mental status, symptoms, and daily life and medical treatment of PD patients. Results Compared to healthy controls, PD patients had significantly higher scores in both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (8.13 vs 5.36, p < 0.001) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) -Depression (4.89 vs 3.82, p = 0.022), as well as a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 5 points (68.9% vs 44.4%, p < 0.001). Sleep disturbance was identified in 68.9% of PD patients. A logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbance of PD patients was independently associated with exacerbation of PD symptoms (OR = 3.616, 95%CI= (1.479, 8.844), p = 0.005) and anxiety (OR = 1.379, 95%CI= (1.157, 1.642), p < 0.001). Compared to male PD patients, female ones had higher PSQI scores (9.28 ± 4.41 vs 7.03 ± 4.01, p = 0.009) and anxiety (32.8% vs 0.1%, p = 0.002) and depression prevalence (34.5% vs 11.5%, p = 0.003). Conclusion The findings of the present study emphasize the importance of mental and sleep health interventions in PD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional attention should be paid to the difficulty encountered by PD patients in seeking medical treatment.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.09.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.09.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.09.011,2020-11-01,,,

1992,An analysis on the panic during COVID-19 pandemic through an online form,"With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people around the world express panic in various behaviors. This affects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and actions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both analyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a significant difference (p = 0.028) in the Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a significant difference (p = 0.000) also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors: Indifference, Annihilation, Nihilism, Paranoia, Sadness, Fear, Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating to Past Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others, Information Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection, Cautiousness, Optimism, and Health Consciousness.

1995,Neurocovid: Pharmacological Recommendations for Delirium Associated With COVID-19,"Background The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as one of the biggest health threats of our generation. A significant portion of patients are presenting with delirium and neuropsychiatric sequelae of the disease. Unique examination findings and responses to treatment have been identified. Objective In this article, we seek to provide pharmacologic and treatment recommendations specific to delirium in patients with COVID-19. Methods We performed a literature search reviewing the neuropsychiatric complications and treatments in prior coronavirus epidemics including Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, as well as the emerging literature regarding COVID-19. We also convened a work group of consultation-liaison psychiatrists actively managing patients with COVID-19 in our hospital. Finally, we synthesized these findings to provide preliminary pharmacologic recommendations for treating delirium in these patients. Results Delirium is frequently found in patients who test positive for COVID-19, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. There appears to be a higher rate of agitation, myoclonus, abulia, and alogia. No data are currently available on the treatment of delirium in patients with COVID-19. Extrapolating from general delirium treatment, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome/severe acute respiratory syndrome case reports, and our experience, preliminary recommendations for pharmacologic management have been assembled. Conclusions COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Low-potency neuroleptics and alpha-2 adrenergic agents may be especially useful in this setting. Further research into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 will be key in developing more targeted treatment guidelines.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.013,2020-11-01,,,

1998,Influence of the COVID-19 outbreak in people with epilepsy: Analysis of a Spanish population (EPICOVID registry),"Background The aim of this study was to have a better understanding of the influence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in people with epilepsy (PWE) and to assess whether there have been changes in seizure control during the current COVID-19 outbreak, exploring the possible causes thereof. Methods This is an observational, retrospective study based on prospective data collection of 100 successive patients who attended an epilepsy outpatient clinic either face-to-face or telephonically during the months of the COVID-19 outbreak and national state of emergency. Results One hundred patients were included, 52% women, mean age 42.4 years. During the COVID-19 period, 27% of the patients presented an increase of >50% of seizure frequency. An increase of stress/anxiety (odds ratios (OR): 5.78; p = 0.008) and a prior higher seizure frequency (OR: 12.4; p = 0.001) were associated with worsening of seizures. Other risk factors were exacerbation of depression, sleep deprivation, less physical activity, and history of epilepsy surgery. Three patients had status epilepticus (SE) and one a cluster of seizures. Likewise, 9% of patients improved their seizure control. Reduction in stress/anxiety (OR: 0.05; p = 0.03) and recent adjustment of antiepileptics (OR: 0.07; p = 0.01) acted as protecting factors. Conclusions A high proportion of PWE suffered a significant worsening of their seizure control during the months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emotional distress due to home confinement was the main factor for the change in seizure control. Promoting physical activity and adequate sleep may minimize the potential impact of the pandemic in PWE. Ensuring correct follow-up can prevent decompensation in those PWE at high risk.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107396,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107396,Scopus,10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107396,2020-11-01,,,

2003,Stress and Symptom Burden in Oncology Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Context No information is available on oncology patients' level of stress and symptom burden during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objectives To evaluate for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, levels of social isolation and loneliness, and the occurrence and severity of common symptoms between oncology patients with low vs. high levels of COVID-19 and cancer-related stress. In addition, to determine which of these characteristics were associated with membership in the high-stressed group. Methods Patients were 18 years and older; had a diagnosis of cancer; and were able to complete an online survey. Results Of the 187 patients in this study, 31.6% were categorized in the stressed group (Impact of Event Scale—Revised [score of ≥24]). Stressed group's Impact of Event Scale—Revised score exceeds previous benchmarks in oncology patients and equates with probable post-traumatic stress disorder. In this stressed group, patients reported occurrence rates for depression (71.2%), anxiety (78.0%), sleep disturbance (78.0%), evening fatigue (55.9%), cognitive impairment (91.5%), and pain (75.9%). Symptom severity scores equate with clinically meaningful levels for each symptom. Conclusion We identified alarmingly high rates of stress and an extraordinarily high symptom burden among patients with cancer, exceeding those previously benchmarked in this population and on par with noncancer patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely impact cancer care for an indefinite period, clinicians must exhibit increased vigilance in their assessments of patients' level of stress and symptom burden. Moreover, an increase in referrals to appropriate supportive care resources must be prioritized for high-risk patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.08.037,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.08.037,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.08.037,2020-11-01,,,

2005,Status and influential factors of anxiety depression and insomnia symptoms in the work resumption period of COVID-19 epidemic: A multicenter cross-sectional study,"Objective In this study, the authors analyzed the status of anxiety depression and insomnia symptoms and influential factors in the work resumption period of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 2, 2020 to March 8, 2020 in Shandong Province, China, using quota sampling combined with snowball sampling. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to assess the anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore the influential factors. Results A total of 4000 invitations were sent from three centers, 3237 valid questionnaires were received. Based on GAD-7, PHQ-9, and ISI scales, 19.5%–21.7% of the participants had anxiety, depression, or insomnia symptoms; 2.9%–5.6% had severe symptoms. Besides, 2.4%, 4.8%, and 4.5% of the participants had anxiety-depression, anxiety-insomnia, or depression-insomnia combined symptoms. The scores of anxiety and insomnia symptoms, along with scores of depression and insomnia symptoms were positively correlated in these samples. Aged 50–64 years and outside activities once in ≥30 days were risk factors of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms in common. During the epidemic, 17.4% of the participants had received psychological interventions, and only 5.2% had received individual interventions. Conclusions The incidence of psychological distress increased during the outbreak of COVID-19 in the work resumption period than the normal period. Current psychological interventions were insufficient; target psychological interventions should be conducted in time.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110253,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110253,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110253,2020-11-01,,,
2006,"The enemy who sealed the world: effects quarantine due to the COVID-19 on sleep quality, anxiety, and psychological distress in the Italian population","Background The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health emergency. The extreme actions aimed to reduce virus diffusion have profoundly changed the lifestyles of the Italian population. Moreover, fear of contracting the infection has generated high levels of anxiety. This study aimed to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep quality, general anxiety symptomatology, and psychological distress. Methods An online survey collected information on socio-demographic data and additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, sleep quality, sleep disorders, generalized anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology related to COVID-19 were assessed. Results This study included 2291 respondents. The results revealed that 57.1% of participants reported poor sleep quality, 32.1% high anxiety, 41.8% high distress, and 7.6% reported PTSD symptomatology linked to COVID-19. Youth and women, those uncertain regarding possible COVID-19 infection, and greater fear of direct contact with those infected by COVID-19 had an increased risk of developing sleep disturbances, as well as higher levels of anxiety and distress. Finally, a significant relationship between sleep quality, generalized anxiety, and psychological distress with PTSD symptoms related to COVID-19 was evidenced. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a risk factor for sleep disorders and psychological diseases in the Italian population, as previously reported in China. These results should be used as a starting point for further studies aimed to develop psychological interventions to minimize the brief and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.011,2020-11-01,,,

2018,Depressive symptoms in the front-line non-medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan,"Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been raising global anxiety and fear to the real or perceived health threat from the virus. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. Methods: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. Results: The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1.0% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90 s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90 s (β = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (β = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (β = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression. Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest the targeted psychological intervention measures should be developed to improve the mental health of non-medical workers on the front-line of COVID-19 epidemic, especially the females and younger individuals.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.078,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.078,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.078,2020-11-01,,,
2019,Changes in alcohol use as a function of psychological distress and social support following COVID-19 related University closings,"Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, universities across the country abruptly closed campuses and transitioned to remote learning. The effects of these unprecedented closures are unknown. The current study examined reported alcohol consumption during the week prior to and after campus closure at a public university in Northeast Ohio. Analysis of data from 1,958 students, who endorsed using alcohol in the past 30 days, demonstrates that alcohol consumption (amount and frequency) increased as time progressed. Those with more symptoms of depression and anxiety reported greater increases in alcohol consumption (assessed via retrospective timeline follow-back) compared to students with fewer symptoms. Furthermore, students with greater perceived social support reported less alcohol consumption. Together, these findings highlight the need for universities to offer services and programs to students that will minimize risk factors and maximize protective factors in order to reduce or prevent alcohol abuse during the coronavirus pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106527,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106527,Scopus,10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106527,2020-11-01,,,
2020,Prevalence of depression and its impact on quality of life among frontline nurses in emergency departments during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Background Frontline medical staff exposed to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could be psychologically and mentally exhausted. This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and their correlates and the association between depression and quality of life (QOL) in Emergency Department (ED) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods This national, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 15 and March 20, 2020 in China. Depression and QOL were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version, respectively. Results The overall prevalence of depression in 1103 ED nurses was 43.61% (95% CI=40.68–46.54%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working in tertiary hospitals (OR=1.647, P=0.009), direct patient care of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.421, P=0.018), and current smokers (OR=3.843, P<0.001) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, nurses with depression had an overall lower QOL compared to those without (F (1,1103)=423.83, P<0.001). Conclusion Depression was common among ED nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative impact of depression on quality of patient care and nurses’ QOL, a heightened awareness of, and early treatment for depression for frontline ED nurses should be provided.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.047,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.047,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.047,2020-11-01,,,
2021,Structural Basis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Antibody Interactions,"The 2019 coronavirus pandemic remains a major public health concern. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) represent a cutting-edge antiviral strategy. We focus here on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, and discuss current progress in antibody research against rampant SARS-CoV-2 infections. We provide a perspective on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-derived nAbs, comparing these with existing SARS-CoV-derived antibodies. We offer insight into how these antibodies cross-react and cross-neutralize by analyzing available structures of spike (S) glycoprotein–antibody complexes. We also propose ways of adopting antibody-based strategies – such as cocktail antibody therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 – to overcome the possible resistance of currently identified mutants and mitigate possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) pathologies. This review provides a platform for the progression of antibody and vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2, and possibly against future coronavirus pandemics.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.09.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.09.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.it.2020.09.004,2020-11-01,,,
2022,Prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms in health care workers after exposure to patients with COVID-19,"Objective To investigate the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) of health care workers (HCWs) who were potentially or directly exposed to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a non-core epidemic area of China. Methods Psychological conditions were evaluated by the multiple psychological evaluation scales in HCWs at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University in Xuzhou City (a non-core epidemic area in China) during COVID-19 epidemic. According to the risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients, HCWs were divided into two groups: HCWs with high-risk (HHCW) group (who worked in wards for COVID-19 patients) and HCWs with low-risk (LHCW) group (who worked in wards for non-COVID-19 patients in the same hospital). The clinical data of psychological evaluation scales from HCWs were collected. Results A total of 171 HCWs were recruited in this study, with 94 (55.0%) HCWs in the HHCW group, and 77 (45.0%) HCWs in the LHCW group. Significant differences were observed in gender, work stress, job risk, and levels of fear and anxiety, and the depression between the two groups (P < 0.05). The incidence of PTSS was 28.7% in HHCW group, while the incidence of PTSS was 13.0% in LHCW group. The PTSS between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Further logistic regression analysis displayed that the exposure to COVID-19, work stress and coping strategies were major risk factors associated with PTSS. Conclusions This study demonstrated that HCWs in HHCW group had a higher chance of developing PTSS when compared with those in LHCW group. The HCWs who were exposed to COVID-19 patients had more stress and chronic stress-related disorders. Stress management should be provided to the first line HCWs who combat with COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100261,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100261,Scopus,10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100261,2020-11-01,,,

This study evaluates psychological distress related to the crisis and identifies predictive factors of anxiety/depression according to age. 2,871 adults were recruited through an online questionnaire during the lockdown. Three subsamples were identified: 18–30; 30–50; > 50 years. The population suffers from anxiety and depression. Young adults adu reported lower levels of living space, occupational activity, social contact and alcohol use, but higher anxiety, depression and uncertainty than older participants. This psychological distress can be explained by lockdown conditions (differently according to age) and by intolerance to uncertainty. Also, youth's alcohol intake has decreased. Deconfinement strategies have been discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113486,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113486,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113486,2020-11-01,,,
2024,Intracranial hemorrhage in critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19,"In this study, we report three cases of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in patients who were initially hospitalized at our tertiary care center in Washington, DC with symptoms of COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was diagnosed in all three patients, who were critically ill, requiring intubation and ventilatory support. During their protracted hospitalizations, subsequent imaging disclosed intracranial hemorrhages, including intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages, in the context of anticoagulation and coagulopathy. We believe this is related to the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to the endothelial lining of the cerebral vasculature via their angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II receptors. Given our findings, we advocate heightened vigilance for intracerebral hemorrhage events, and scanning when practicable, in COVID-19 patients which have prolonged ventilatory support and depressed neurologic examinations.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2020.08.026,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2020.08.026,Scopus,10.1016/j.jocn.2020.08.026,2020-11-01,,,

2026,Access to healthcare and prevalence of anxiety and depression in persons with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multicountry online survey,"Objective The objective of this study was to assess access to healthcare and to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among persons with epilepsy (PWE) during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods We conducted a multicountry online survey among PWE. Persons with epilepsy were invited to participate through various social media channels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale were used to score anxiety and depression. Logistic regression modeling was used to investigate factors associated with anxiety and depression. Results Three hundred ninety-nine PWE were included (mean age: 38.22 ± 12.09 years), the majority were female (80.2%) and living in high-income countries (83.2%). Two hundred three PWE reported symptoms of a cold since January 2020. Nine (25%) of the 36 PWE tested for COVID were positive. A total of 72 PWE (19.6%) reported problems to obtain antiseizure medication (ASM), which in 25% of cases was directly COVID-related. Of the 399 PWE, 201 (50.4%) screened positive for anxiety according to the HADS; 159 (39.8%) and 187 (46.9%) PWE screened positive for depression based on the HADS and PHQ-9 scale, respectively. Female gender and financial problems were associated with both depression and anxiety. A planned follow-up consultation with the treating physician was associated with a lower risk of depression, whereas difficulties to access ASM treatment increased the odds of depression. In 65/137 (47.4%) PWE with a planned follow-up visit with the treating physician, this consultation was canceled. Conclusions Innovative approaches are needed to ensure continuity in access to ASM treatment. Healthcare workers should ensure continued follow-up, either through inperson or telehealth appointments, to timely identify symptoms of anxiety and depression and act accordingly.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107350,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107350,Scopus,10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107350,2020-11-01,,,

2031,COVID-19 in a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient treated with alemtuzumab: Insight to the immune response after COVID,"Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel disease that has spread abruptly over the world, allowing the development of countermeasures an urgent global priority. It has been speculated that elder people and patient with comorbidities may be at risk of developing complication. On the other hand, it has been seen that immunosuppressed patients could develop a mild presentation of the disease. Based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressant agents are currently being tested as potential treatment for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Methods report a patient treated with alemtuzumab (Humanized monoclonal antibody against the lymphocyte and monocyte surface antigen CD52, which depletes B and T cells) (Thompson et al., 2018) for recurrent remittent multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who developed mild COVID-19. Results Despite complete B and T cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days with no need for hospitalization due to COVID-19 and no clinical evidence of disease activation regarding her MS.

2032,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general Chinese population: Changes, predictors and psychosocial correlates","The current COVID-19 pandemic is not only a threat to physical health, but also brings a burden to mental health in the general Chinese population. However, the temporal change of mental health status due to pandemic-related stress in relation to protective and risk factors to hostility is less known. This study was implemented at two timepoints, i.e., during the peak and the remission of the COVID-19 pandemic. 3233 Chinese individuals participated in the first wave, and among them 1390 participants were followed in a second wave. The result showed that fear significantly decreased over time, while depression level significantly increased during the second wave compared to the first wave of the survey. Younger age, lower-income, increased level of perceived stress, and current quarantine experience were significant predictors of depression escalation. Younger people and individuals who had a higher initial stress response tended to show more hostility. Furthermore, the use of negative coping strategy plays a potential intermediating role in the stress-related increase in hostility, while social support acts as a buffer in hostility in the general population under high stress. As the whole world is facing the same pandemic, this research provides several implications for public mental health intervention.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113396,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113396,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113396,2020-11-01,,,

To determine the effect of these restrictions on suicidal ideation, a total of 3,120 individuals completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at one of three time points from April through June 2020. The percentage of respondents endorsing suicidal ideation was greater with each passing month for those under lockdown or shelter-in-place restrictions due to the novel coronavirus, but remained relatively stable and unchanged for those who reported no such restrictions.

Methods A convenience sample of older adult Israelis (N = 277, mean age = 69.58 ± 6.72) completed web-based questionnaires comprising loneliness, anxiety, depressive, and peritraumatic distress symptoms. They also reported how old they felt. Results The positive relationship between loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms was weak among those who felt younger than their age while this very same relationship was robust among those feeling older. Conclusions Young subjective age may weaken the loneliness-symptom association among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults holding an older age identity are more susceptible to the adverse effects of loneliness. Although preliminary, the findings may inform screening and interventions.

The increases in stress levels were significantly larger among older and less educated respondents (P for interactions <0.001). Conclusion Hong Kong had a mental health emergency even with no lockdown and well-managed outbreaks. Older and under-privileged people will suffer most.

2043,Are multiple sclerosis patients and their caregivers more anxious and more committed to following the basic preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Background The novel coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic of the kind not seen for a century, has caused global apprehension and distress. Objectives to evaluate whether the psychological state and behaviours of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and their caregivers were different from the non-MS population or not during the pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 115 MS patients, 33 MS caregivers and 129 healthy controls. Depression anxiety stress score-21 (DASS-21) was used for evaluation of their psychological state. Results MS patients had significantly higher DASS-21 scores (51.48±29.62) than their caregivers (29.79±27.19) and non-MS population (32.91±23.39) (p = 0.005). Younger patients (r=-0.252, p<0.0001), those with high EDSS scores (r = 0.023, p = 0.013) and those who believed that MS patients are at high risk for COVID-19 infection (p = 0.009) had the highest anxiety scores. There was no difference between the three groups in the level of commitment to staying at home (p = 0.747), wearing facemask (p = 0.164), wearing gloves (0.225), avoiding crowd (p = 0.225) and frequent hand washing (p = 0.570). Anxious patients had more relapses (p = 0.002) and pseudorelapses (p = 0.008). Conclusion In this cohort, MS patients were more anxious, stressed and depressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than their caregivers and the non-MS population, but they were not more motivated to follow the basic preventive measures against infection.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102580,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102580,Scopus,10.1016/j.msard.2020.102580,2020-11-01,,,

2047,Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong,"Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing are effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health have not been investigated. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. We conducted an anonymous online survey of 432 residents in Hong Kong to examine psychological distress in the community. The results indicate a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% (95% C.I. = [60.6%, 70.4%]) of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% (95% C.I. = [18.2%, 27.2%]) of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis risk. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not social network size, were associated with increased psychiatric symptoms.

2055,"Psychological Influence of Coronovirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on the General Public, Medical Workers, and Patients With Mental Disorders and its Countermeasures","Background: Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in 2019, and now it spreads in more than 100 countries around the world. On January 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. It was classified as a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. With the increase in the number of cases reported by various countries every day, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more and more attention around the world. At the same time, this public health emergency has caused a variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety, and depression. In addition, the Wuhan Mental Health Center's analysis of 2144 calls from the psychological hotline from February 4 to February 20, 2020, showed that the general public accounted for 70%, medical workers accounted for 2.2%, patients with mental disorders accounted for 19.5%, and other personnel accounted for 8.3% (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmff1vnaLsT2d9xQkK5pwg). Conclusion: Therefore, while controlling the pandemic, the government should also pay attention to the mental health of the general public, medical workers, and patients with mental disorders. Community mental health service systems, online mental health services, telemedicine, and other measures for patients with mental disorders may play a vital role during the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.005,2020-11-01,,,
2056,The role of perceived social support on depression and sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The aim of the present study was to examine the role of perceived social support pertaining to a range of psychological health outcomes amongst individuals undergoing social isolation and social distancing during COVID-19. A total of 2,020 participants provided responses to an online cross-sectional survey comprised of validated instruments including the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Brief Irritability Test (BITe) and the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS). Individuals experiencing self-isolation had significantly higher rates of depression, irritability and loneliness compared to those who were not. The risk for elevated levels of depression symptoms was 63% lower in individuals who reported higher levels of social support compared to those with low perceived social support. Similarly, those with high social support had a 52% lower risk of poor sleep quality compared to those with low social support. Social support was found to be significantly associated with elevated risk for depression and poorer sleep quality.

The study focused on a period of gradual reopening but rising infection rates. The investigation included validated screening measures of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), trauma-related symptoms (PCL-5), and alcohol use (AUDIT-C). A notable percentage of participants reported elevated symptoms on each of these outcomes. In separate multivariable analyses that accounted for a number of demographic and pandemic-related covariates, individuals who reported greater pandemic-related disruption in daily life, and those with a prior history of mental health concerns, were more likely to screen positive for depressive, anxiety and trauma-related symptoms.

2059,Extended lockdown and India's alcohol policy: a qualitative analysis of newspaper articles,"Objectives Since 25th March 2020 India went into a complete and extended lockdown. Alcohol production, sales, and purchase were barred with this overnight prohibition order. We conducted a qualitative analysis of the media reports published within the first month of the nationwide lockdown with the objectives (a) using the media reports as indications of possible public health impact and population response of a sudden alcohol prohibition in India, (b) suggesting areas for future research. Methods We performed thematic and content analysis of 350 articles published online in national newspapers between the 26th March, 2020 and 25th April, 2020. Initial inductive, followed by deductive coding was done in this exploratory thematic analysis. Results The thematic analysis revealed four main themes: the beneficial aspects of the policy, the harmful aspects of the policy, non-compliance and attempts to change and / or subvert the policy, popularity and level of public buy-in of the policy. We generated relevant sub-themes under main themes. Two additional themes, not directly related to the sudden prohibition, were use of stigmatizing language and ethical concerns. The content analysis showed the frequency of the appearance of the main themes and proportions of sub-themes and codes under those main themes. Conclusion The harms, perceived from the media reports, should be balanced against the potential benefits. Absence of a national-level alcohol policy was made apparent by the reflexive, disconnected, and conflictual measures.

2067,Maternal psychological distress &amp; mental health service use during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background Mental health problems are increasingly recognized as a significant and concerning secondary effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. Methods Participants (N = 641) were mothers of children age 0–8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. Results Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0–18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. Limitations Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. Conclusions Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms. Identified risk factors for depression and anxiety across different child age ranges can inform targeted early intervention strategies to prevent long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family well-being and child development.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.081,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.081,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.081,2020-11-01,,,

2069,"Lockdown, quarantine measures, and social distancing: Associations with depression, anxiety and distress at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic among adults from Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic is suggested to have a negative impact on mental health. To prevent the spread of Sars-CoV-2, governments worldwide have implemented different forms of public health measures ranging from physical distancing recommendations to stay-at-home orders, which have disrupted individuals’ everyday life tremendously. However, evidence on the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures with mental health are limited so far. In this study, we investigated the role of sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors for immediate mental health consequences in a nationwide community sample of adults from Germany (N = 4335). Specifically, we examined the effects of different forms and levels of restriction resulting from public health measures (e.g. quarantine, stay-at-home order) on anxiety and depression symptomatology, health anxiety, loneliness, the occurrence of fearful spells, psychosocial distress and life-satisfaction. We found that higher restrictions due to lockdown measures, a greater reduction of social contacts and greater perceived changes in life were associated with higher mental health impairments. Importantly, a subjectively assumed but not an officially announced stay-at-home order was associated with poorer mental health. Our findings underscore the importance of adequate risk communication and targeted mental health recommendations especially for vulnerable groups during these challenging times.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113462,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113462,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113462,2020-11-01,,,
2070,Effects of COVID-19 in South African health system and society: An explanatory study,"Background and aims The underestimation of the severity of COVID-19 by the South African government resulted in delayed action against the pandemic. Ever since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic preventive action was comprehensively upgraded worldwide. This prompted South African authorities to implement physical distancing, self-isolation, closure of non-essential services, schools, travelling restrictions and recursive national lockdowns to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This explanatory study sought to review the effects of COVID-19 in the South African health system and society. Methods The study applied literature research of COVID-19 reports, policies from the National Department of Health, WHO, Africa CDC, and articles from Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. Results The South African health system is affected by the lack of PPEs, increased mortality rates, mental health problems, substance abuse, resurgent of NCDs. The closure of international borders, global demand meltdown, supply disruptions, dramatic scaling down of human and industrial activities during lockdown cause socio-economic problems. The prolonged effects of lockdown on psychosocial support services resulted in the outbursts of uncertainties, acute panic, fear, depression, obsessive behaviours, social unrests, stigmatization, anxiety, increased gender-based violence cases and discrimination in the distribution of relief food aid. Conclusion To slow down the spread of COVID-19, massive testing must be adopted, contact tracing, isolation, and home quarantine guidelines for asymptomatic cases which promote behavioural change and reviewing of policy on food relief.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.09.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.09.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.09.016,2020-11-01,,,

The present study examined increases in loneliness in a young adult sample, for whom increases were greater, and association with increases in depression and anxiety. Method Data from 564 young adults (ages 22–29, 60.7% women) were collected in January 2020 (pre-pandemic) and April/May 2020 (during pandemic). Results Loneliness increased from January to April/May and changes in loneliness were greater for females, those with higher perceived social support in January, and those with greater concerns about the pandemic's social impacts. Depression (but not anxiety) increased during this time with changes in loneliness accounting for much of the increase in depression.

2073,Effects of psychological stress on adverse pregnancy outcomes and nonpharmacologic approaches for reduction: an expert review,"Both acute and chronic stress can cause allostatic overload, or long-term imbalance in mediators of homeostasis, that results in disruptions in the maternal-placental-fetal endocrine and immune system responses. During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (eg, hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one’s mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied postpartum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Although some of these nonpharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend toward inconsistent implementation of these modalities. Future investigations should focus on methods to increase ease of uptake, ensure each option is available at home, and provide a standardized way to evaluate whether combinations of different interventions may provide added benefit.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100229,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100229,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100229,2020-11-01,,,
2074,Mental health status of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis Italian patients returning to work soon after the easing of lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic: A monocentric experience,"Background The prolonged lockdown related to COVID-19 pandemic determined disruption of lifestyle and social isolation. Methods To assess the mental health status of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients regularly followed at the MS center of Catania (Italy) and returning to work after the easing of lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic. Then, to identify any variables associated to psychological distress. RRMS patients returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic were invited to answer a telephonic interview consisting of the administration of the Short-Screening-Scale for DSM IV (SSS-DSM-IV), the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Other information was extracted from electronic medical records. Results Valid and complete interviews were obtained from 432 patients (response rate 64.3%). Out of them, 277 (64.1%) were female, mean age 40.4 (SD 12.4) years. One-hundred thirty-seven (31.7%) RRMS patients received a score ≥4 at the SSS-DSM-IV, indicating clinically significant PTSD-like symptoms. About DASS-21, moderate-to-severe anxiety was reported by 210 RRMS patients (48.6%), moderate-to-severe depression, and moderate-to-severe stress were respectively reported by 95 (22%) and 220 (50.9%) RRMS patients. Insomnia was reported by 128 patients (29.6%). Factors associated with major severity of symptoms were: marital status, previous diagnosis of mood disorders, switching/starting Disease-Modifying Therapies in the last 12 months, and a higher level of disability measured with Expanded Disability Status Scale (for all, p<.05).

2075,"The impact of social distancing and self-isolation in the last corona COVID-19 outbreak on the body weight in Sulaimani governorate- Kurdistan/Iraq, a prospective case series study","Background Our area, corona (COVID-19) quarantine was applied from March 14 to April 23, 2020. It was in all forms, including curfew, social distancing, self-quarantine, area quarantine, self-monitoring, and isolation. Due to their concerns about their safety and families, friends, colleagues, and society, everybody was feeling upset, fearful, and anxious. Several studies have reported an association between prolonged sitting time and weight gain. As a way to relieve the tension during that period, people started stocking up on unhealthy foods like over-salted snacks and over-sweetened sugars. People stayed at home, feeling bored, anxious, and stressed and sought relief by eating. Also, there was a rise in emotional eating when the stress of isolation increased by the closure of gyms, casinos, and movie theaters. Moreover, restaurants were allowed to serve the only takeout. Besides, unemployment was skyrocketing, hospitals were overflowing (or were preparing for the possibility), many people were struggling to meet their basic needs, and no one knows when or how it would end. Objective The study aimed to figure out whether social isolation during the COVID-19 quarantine is consistent and associated with emotional eating and gaining weight or not. Methods A prospective cross-sectional case series study was conducted on 765 patients who have visited the bariatric clinic in Sulaimani city, Kurdistan-Iraq, from April 23 to June 23, 2020. An individual face-to-face interview was conducted with each participant to obtain signed informed consent, provide them with information about the type and the subject of the work, and ask them the study's questions. Each interview lasted between 30 and 45 min and was conducted in a closed session by two Kurdistan Board trainees. Results No patient who was quarantined for the COVID-19 was included in the work, but all other patients were included. The selected patients were those who had undergone social distancing (n = 568, 82.48%) by the local law and did self-isolation (n = 134, 17.51%) at home for reasons like having comorbidity, being prone to contamination due to their jobs (health, police, and media workers), having some family members at home with comorbidity (n = 23, 03.00%), and having comorbidity and having undergone social distancing because of their other family members’ need to do so for their physical disability (n = 25, 03.27%). Almost all patients (n = 741, 96.86%), even, those with comorbidity (n = 136, 17.78%), were emotionally stable before the outbreak. Seventy-three female patients (09.54%) and138 males (20.65%) sustain their weight during and two months after the outbreak, while the rest (n = 554, 72.41%) gained different amounts of weight. Conclusion Social distancing and self-isolation in the last COVID-19 outbreak influenced weight gain, but weight gain of less than 2 kg was observed among almost all patients who gained weight (98.05%). The patients who were gain more than 3 kg were mostly females or/and from the center of large cities.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.09.024,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.09.024,Scopus,10.1016/j.amsu.2020.09.024,2020-11-01,,,

2077,Psychiatric emergency care during Coronavirus 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic lockdown: results from a Department of Mental Health and Addiction of northern Italy,"Background The current COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent containment measures are leading to increasing mental health issues both in psychiatric patients and general population. Objective We aimed to compare the number and characteristics of emergency psychiatric consultations during the phase 1 of lockdown with respect to the same period in 2019 in a Department of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA) located in Lombardy region. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study including subjects consecutively admitted to two psychiatric emergency rooms of DMHA in Monza, Lombardy, Italy. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, referred symptoms, diagnosis and information on patients’ illness course following the emergency consultations were collected. No subjects were excluded for the purposes of the study. Results Between February 21st and May 3rd 2020, there was a marked reduction in the number of psychiatric emergency consultations, if compared to the same period of 2019. Subjects who were living in psychiatric residential treatment facilities, had cannabis addiction and a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder were significantly more likely to present to emergency psychiatric consultations during lockdown.

2078,"Psychological distress surveillance and related impact analysis of hospital staff during the COVID-19 epidemic in Chongqing, China","Background Hospital staff are vulnerable and at high risk of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection. The aim of this study was to monitor the psychological distress in hospital staff and examine the relationship between the psychological distress and possible causes during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods An online survey was conducted from February 1 to February 14, 2020. Hospital staff from five national COVID-19 designated hospitals in Chongqing participated. Data collected included demographics and stress responses to COVID-19: 1) the impact of event scale to measure psychological stress reactions; 2) generalizedanxietydisorder 7 to measure anxiety symptoms; 3) Patient Health Questionnaire 9 to measure depression symptoms; 4) Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale to measure obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS); and 5) Patient Health Questionnaire 15 to measure somatization symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors that were correlated with psychological distress. Results Hospital staff that participated in this study were identified as either doctors or nurses. A total of 456 respondents completed the questionnaires with a response rate of 91.2%. The mean age was 30.67 ± 7.48 years (range, 17 to 64 years). Of all respondents, 29.4% were men. Of the staff surveyed, 43.2% had stress reaction syndrome. The highest prevalence of psychological distress was OCS (37.5%), followed by somatization symptoms (33.3%), anxiety symptoms (31.6%), and depression symptoms (29.6%). Univariate analyses indicated that female subjects, middle aged subjects, subjects in the low income group, and subjects working in isolation wards were prone to experience psychological distress. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed “Reluctant to work or considered resignation” (odds ratio [OR], 5.192; 95%CI, 2.396–11.250; P < .001), “Afraid to go home because of fear of infecting family” (OR, 2.099; 95%CI, 1.299–3.391; P = .002) “Uncertainty about frequent modification of infection and control procedures” (OR, 1.583; 95%CI, 1.061–2.363; P = .025), and“Social support” (OR, 1.754; 95%CI, 1.041–2.956; P = .035) were correlated with psychological reactions. “Reluctant to work or considered resignation” and “Afraid to go home because of fear of infecting family” were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of Anxiety (OR, 3.622; 95% CI, 1.882–6.973; P < .001; OR, 1.803; 95% CI, 1.069–3.039; P = .027), OCS (OR, 5.241; 95% CI, 2.545–10.793; P < .001; OR, 1.999; 95% CI, 1.217–3.282; P = .006) and somatization (OR, 5.177; 95% CI, 2.595–10.329; P < .001; OR, 1.749; 95% CI, 1.051–2.91; P = .031). “Stigmatization and rejection in neighborhood because of hospital work”, “Reluctant to work or considered resignation” and “Uncertainty about frequent modification of infection and control procedures” were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of Depression(OR, 2.297; 95% CI, 1.138–4.637; P = .020; OR, 3.134; 95% CI, 1.635–6.006; P = .001; OR, 1.645; 95% CI, 1.075–2.517; P = .022). Conclusions Hospital staff showed different prevalence of psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic.

2081,"Social (Un)distancing: Teammate Interactions, Athletic Identity, and Mental Health of Student-Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose Physical distancing measures to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus have presented challenges for the mental health and well-being of college students. As campus activities ceased, student-athletes abruptly became isolated from teammates and were no longer able to participate in sport activities that are often central to their identity as an athlete. However, student-athletes who have supportive social connections with teammates during this pandemic may maintain their athletic identity to a greater extent and report better mental health. The present study examined how student-athletes’ mental health was associated with teammate social support, connectedness, and changes to athletic identity from before to during COVID-19. Method A sample of 234 student-athletes completed surveys before COVID-19 physical distancing (February 2020), with 135 (63% female) participating in a follow-up in the month following school closures (April 2020). Path models estimated the effects of teammate social support and connectedness (during COVID-19), as well as changes in athletic identity on indices of mental health. Results Considering all path models tested, student-athletes who received more social support and reported more connectedness with teammates reported less dissolution of their athletic identity and—in most models—reported better mental health and well-being. Indirect effects indicated that student-athletes’ change in athletic identity mediated the effects of teammate social support on psychological well-being and depression symptoms. Conclusions In addition to advancing theory on how small groups relate to mental health, these findings demonstrate the value in remaining socially connected with peers and maintaining role identities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.001,2020-11-01,,,

2084,The Disproportionate Burden of the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Pregnant Black Women,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the well-being of vulnerable populations in the US, including Black people. The impact on pregnant women is of special concern for the intrauterine and post-natal development of their offspring. We evaluated in an online survey a sample of 913 pregnant women, 216 Black, 571 White, 126 Other, during a 2-week stay-at-home mandate in the Philadelphia region. We applied logistic regression models and analysis of covariance to examine general and pregnancy-specific worries and negative consequences arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and resilience. Black pregnant women reported greater likelihood of having their employment negatively impacted, more concerns about a lasting economic burden, and more worries about their prenatal care, birth experience, and post-natal needs. In the full sample, 11.1% of women met screening criteria for anxiety and 9.9% met criteria for depression. Black women were more likely to meet criteria for depression than White women, but this difference was not significant accounting for covariates. Resilience factors including self-reliance and emotion regulation were higher in Black women.

In this study, we aim to evaluate mental health symptoms among head and neck surgeons in Brazil surrounding the time it was declared the epicenter of the virus. Materials and methods A cross-sectional, survey-based study evaluating burnout, anxiety, distress, and depression among head and neck surgeons in Brazil, assessed through the single-item Mini-Z burnout assessment, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. Results 163 physicians completed the survey (74.2% males). Anxiety, distress, burnout, and depression symptoms were reported in 74 (45.5%), 43 (26.3%), 24 (14.7%), and 26 (16.0%) physicians, respectively. On multivariable analysis, female physicians were more likely to report a positive screening for burnout compared to males (OR 2.88, CI [1.07–7.74]). Physicians 45 years or older were less likely to experience anxiety symptoms than those younger than 45 years (OR 0.40, CI [0.20–0.81]). Physicians with no self-reported prior psychiatric conditions were less likely to have symptoms of distress compared to those with such history (OR 0.11, CI [0.33–0.38]).

Methods We analyzed service utilization data from the National Eating Disorder Information Centre (NEDIC). We compared the number of contacts and symptom frequency between the pandemic period and previous years. Results NEDIC was contacted 609 times during March 1–April 30, 2020 (72.1% individuals affected by disordered eating, 20.4% caregivers). The number of total contacts significantly increased from 2018 to 2019 and 2018 to 2020 (X2(3) = 50.34, p < .001). Among affected individuals (80.4% women), the number of contacts during the pandemic period was significantly higher (n = 439; X2(2) = 92.74, p < .001) compared to 2018 (n = 197) and 2019 (n = 312). There were higher rates of eating disorder symptoms, anxiety, and depression in 2020 compared to previous years. Thematic analysis of instant chats from the pandemic year revealed four emerging themes: 1) lack of access to treatment, 2) worsening of symptoms, 3) feeling out of control, and 4) need for support.

2093,Rapid Systematic Review: The Impact of Social Isolation and Loneliness on the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents in the Context of COVID-19,"Objective Disease containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation. We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents. Method For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1946, and March 29, 2020. Of the articles, 20% were double screened using predefined criteria, and 20% of data was double extracted for quality assurance. Results A total of 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n = 51,576; mean age 15.3 years). In all, 61 studies were observational, 18 were longitudinal, and 43 were cross-sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias, although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time at which loneliness was measured and between 0.25 and 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness. Conclusion Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and most likely anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventive support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.05.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.05.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.jaac.2020.05.009,2020-11-01,,,

The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. Methods This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. Results In the T1 survey, the ""Typhoon Eye Effect"" appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional ""infection point"" appeared, there was an ""Exposure Effect"", the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. Conclusion This survey found that there is an emotional ""infection point"" in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2.

2102,An Acute Manic Episode During 2019-nCoV Quarantine,"Background The 2019-nCov pandemic is currently a stressor for the general public worldwide. In China, people who have a history of contact with infected or suspected individuals need to quarantine for at least 2 weeks. Many people experienced anxiety, panic and depression in the quarantine period. However, acute manic episode triggered by stressful events is not common and was neglected. Case presentation A 32-year-old woman with direct contact history with her infected colleagues showed elevated mood and increased activity when she was identified negative of nuclear acid amplification test, after experiencing extreme stress in quarantine. She was diagnosed with acute manic episode finally. The social zeitgeber and reward hypersensitivity theoretical models have attempted to use psychobiological perspectives to determine why life stress can trigger a mood episode, including (hypo)mania. Besides, the temporal correlation between her somatic symptoms and psychological stimuli indicated a possibility of functional disturbance under acute stress. Conclusion Quarantine is a major stressful event disrupting social zeitgebers for people who have had contact with infected individuals, especially for vulnerable individuals with a hypersensitive reward system. Stress could act as a trigger in the onset of manic episode, so psychological support should be more targeted at the vulnerable individuals in the initial phase of emergent crisis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.112,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.112,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.112,2020-11-01,,,
2103,"COVID-19, Psychological Well-being and Physical Activity Levels in Older Adults During the Nationwide Lockdown in Spain","Objective The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has forced nationwide lockdowns in many countries. As a result, most of the Spanish population had to self-isolate at home. The physical and psychological consequences of this unexpected scenario could be particularly worrisome for people older than 60 years. This study is aimed to examine the psychological well-being of older adults during the home isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate whether meeting the World Health Organization's global recommendations on physical activity (PA) for health is associated with their resilience, affect, and depressive symptoms. Design, setting, and participants In this cross-sectional study, a total of 483 citizens whose ages ranged from 60 to 92 years (overall sample: M = 65.49, SD = 5.14) were recruited via a snowball sampling strategy to answer to an online questionnaire. Measurements The four instruments used were The Connor-Davidson CD-RISC resilience scale, The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the six-item self-report scale of Depressive Symptoms, and The international Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results Results showed that older adults who regularly engaged in vigorous (VPA) and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the quarantine reported higher scores in resilience (Locus, Self-efficacy, and Optimism), positive affect, and lower in depressive symptoms. Conclusion These finding are the first quantitative evidence pointing toward a link between engagement in VPA and/or MVPA and resilience, positive affect, and depressive symptoms within the COVID-19 restrictions in Spain. Acknowledging these associations may be important in developing health promotion programs for older people during the remaining period of confinement or future ones.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.08.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.08.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.08.007,2020-11-01,,,
2104,Coronavirus and Its Implications for Psychiatry: A Rapid Review of the Early Literature,"Background The coronavirus pandemic has changed health care rapidly and dramatically. Objective To provide a critical synthesis of the scientific literature on the pandemic's implications for psychiatric practice. Methods A rapid literature review was undertaken to identify scientific literature linking psychiatric outcomes and practice changes due to coronavirus and the disease it causes (COVID-19). A structured quality assessment was used to assess those articles reporting quantitative data. Results Fifty articles were identified for inclusion, but only 12 contained original data. Eleven of those twelve were rated as of weak quality. The literature described psychiatric sequelae of the coronavirus and related public health interventions through cross-sectional surveys among different populations; no studies include diagnostic or functional impairment data. Populations at risk include COVID-19 survivors, health care workers, the elderly, and those with preexisting psychiatric disease. Impacts on psychiatric practice were described, again without data on changes to quality or access of care. Conclusions There is a quickly accumulating body of evidence on the psychiatric implications of coronavirus including psychological effects on the general public and at-risk subgroups. Similarly, psychiatric practice has witnessed substantial adaptation to the pandemic. However, there remain significant gaps in scientific knowledge. We suggest opportunities for consultation-liaison psychiatry to improve the understanding of the relationship between coronavirus and psychiatric care.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.018,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.018,Scopus,10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.018,2020-11-01,,,
2105,"The mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers, and interventions to help them: A rapid systematic review","The covid-19 pandemic has heavily burdened healthcare systems throughout the world. We performed a rapid systematic review to identify, assess and summarize research on the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on HCWs (healthcare workers). We utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence on 11 May and included 59 studies. Six reported on implementing interventions, but none reported on effects of the interventions. HCWs reported low interest in professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact. Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others. Social support correlated with less mental health problems. HCWs reported anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic. We assessed the certainty of the estimates of prevalence of these symptoms as very low using GRADE. Most studies did not report comparative data on mental health symptoms before the pandemic or in the general population. There seems to be a mismatch between risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among HCWs in the current pandemic, their needs and preferences, and the individual psychopathology focus of current interventions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113441,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113441,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113441,2020-11-01,,,

2113,Pregnancy after loss during the COVID19 pandemic,"Background Rapid changes to how maternity health care is delivered has occurred in many countries across the globe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Maternity care provisions have been challenged attempting to balance the needs and safety of pregnant women and their care providers. Women experiencing a pregnancy after loss (PAL) during these times face particularly difficult circumstances. Aim In this paper we highlight the situation in three high income countries (Australia, Ireland and USA) and point to the need to remember the unique and challenging circumstances of these PAL families. We suggest new practices may be deviating from established evidence-based guidelines and outline the potential ramifications of these changes. Findings Recommendations for health care providers are suggested to bridge the gap between the necessary safety requirements due to the pandemic, the role of the health care provider, and the needs of families experiencing a pregnancy after loss. Discussion Changes to practices i.e. limiting the number of antenatal appointments and access to a support person may have detrimental effects on both mother, baby, and their family. However, new guidelines in maternity care practices developed to account for the pandemic have not necessarily considered women experiencing pregnancy after loss. Conclusion Bereaved mothers and their families experiencing a pregnancy after loss should continue to be supported during the COVID-19 pandemic to limit unintended consequences.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.07.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.07.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.wombi.2020.07.011,2020-11-01,,,

2115,Socio-economic and psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on private practice and public hospital radiologists,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent reorganisation of the healthcare system to prevent hospitals from overflowing and the virus from spreading. Our objective was to evaluate the socioeconomic and psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on radiologists. Material and methods French radiologists were invited to answer an online survey during the pandemic through mailing lists. The questionnaire was accessible for nine days. It covered socio-demographic information, exposure to COVID-19 at work and impact on work organisation, and included the Insomnia Severity Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Outcomes were moderate to severe insomnia, definite symptoms of depression or anxiety. Risk and protective factors were identified through multivariate binary logistic regression. Results 1515 radiologists answered the survey. Overall, 674 (44.5 %) worked in a highCOVID-19 density area, 671 (44.3 %) were women, and 809 (53.4 %) worked in private practice. Among responders, 186 (12.3 %) expressed insomnia, 222 (14.6 %) anxiety, and 189 (12.5 %) depression symptoms. Lack of protective equipment, increased teleradiology activity and negative impact on education were risk factors for insomnia (respectively OR [95 %CI]:1.7[1.1−2.7], 1.5[1.1−2.2], and 2.5[1.8−3.6]). Female gender, respiratory history, working in COVID-19 high density area, increase of COVID-19 related activity, and impacted education were risk factors for anxiety (OR[95 %CI]:1.7[1.2−2.3], 2[1.1−3.4], 1.5[1.1−2], 1.2[1−1.4], and 2.1[1.5−3]). Conversely, working in a public hospital was a protective factor against insomnia, anxiety, and depression (OR[95 %CI]:0.4[0.2−0.7], 0.6[0.4−0.9], and 0.5[0.3−0.8]). Conclusions During COVID-19 pandemic, many radiologists expressed depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms. Working in a public hospital was a protective factor against every psychological symptom. Socio-economic impact was also major especially in private practice.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109285,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109285,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109285,2020-11-01,,,

2118,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care of &gt;1,000 People living with multiple sclerosis: A cross-sectional study","Background People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experienced changes in health behaviors and access to MS care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The USA has the highest recognized number of Covid19 infections globally. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 has not been well characterized in large samples of PwMS to date. The MS patient perspective on COVID-19 would complement the physician-reported cases of MS and COVID-19 in the literature. Methods A cross-sectional survey of adult PwMS was performed online, using the U.S.-based patient-powered iConquerMS™ platform, in April 2020. Results There were 1,145 respondents (response rate: 20%). 1,019 had a diagnosis of MS and responded completely (average age: 54.2 years, range: 20-81; 79% female; 64% relapsing remitting, 22% secondary progressive, 12% primary progressive; 88% in the USA). 748 (73%) used a DMT in the last year, primarily higher-efficacy therapies: ocrelizumab (n=238), dimethyl fumarate (n=85), fingolimod (n=80). The most frequent comorbidities were depression (41%), hypertension (26%), and asthma (12%). Women were more worried than men about COVID-19 (p=0.001); non-white-identifying PwMS believed it was a greater danger to their health than white-identifying PwMS (p=0.002). Through the continuum of symptoms to care, 61% of PwMS (n=617) reported symptoms associated with COVID-19, 39% (n=395) knew someone exposed to COVID-19, 4% (n=38) were aware of a personal COVID-19 exposure, 13% (n=128) wanted testing for COVID-19 but could not access it, and 4% (n=43) were tested. Specific to their MS care, 64% (n=650) canceled a medical visit, 22% (n=222) canceled a neurologist visit, 11% (n=112) canceled an MRI, 21% (n=212) canceled a laboratory test, and 10% (n=98) changed their DMT in some way due to COVID19 including 65 delaying at least one dose. 37% (n=382) had a telehealth visit due to COVID-19. 37% of PwMS (n=374) experienced employment changes, most commonly working from home (n=194) and having work hours reduced (n=65) while 32 lost their jobs. Of the 7 cases who tested positive for COVID-19 (<1% of participants) (5 female; age range: 29-64 years), DMTs included dimethyl fumarate (n=2), ocrelizumab (n=1), rituximab (n=1), and a clinical trial drug (n=1). Conclusions A majority of people with MS reported interruptions to their MS care along the MS care pathway alongside limited access to COVID-19 testing. Postponements and delays in care were common with 10% of participants reporting a change in their DMT administration. Less than 1% of this self-referred convenience online cohort had a positive test for COVID-19 although more than half reported symptoms that are associated with COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102512,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102512,Scopus,10.1016/j.msard.2020.102512,2020-11-01,,,
2119,Gender-related time course of sleep disturbances and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown: A longitudinal study on the Italian population,"Italy was the first western hotspot of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to contain the spread of the virus, the Italian Government imposed home confinement to the entire population for almost two months. The present study is the first large-scale longitudinal report of the sleep and mental health changes during the prolonged lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We focused on the gendered vulnerability in a sample of the Italian population since cross-sectional research identified women to be more at-risk than men during this unprecedented situation. A total of 2701 individuals (mean age ± standard deviation, 32.37 ± 11.62; range, 18–82) participated in a web-based longitudinal survey consisting of two measurements. Participants were first-time recruited on social networks and via telephone messages through a snowball sampling and tested during the third week of the lockdown period. Subsequently, a follow-up evaluation was carried out during the seventh week of restraining measures. The survey assessed sleep quality, insomnia and depression symptoms, perceived stress, and anxiety, using the following questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Beck Depression Inventory-second edition, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, and the State-Anxiety Inventory. Female gender showed the worst condition for all the examined dimensions in both the assessments. Nevertheless, at the follow-up women reported a reduction in insomnia and depression severity symptoms, perceived stress, and anxiety. On the other hand, male participants showed a worsening of sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, and perceived stress. Consequently, the gender prevalence gap of clinical conditions such as insomnia and depression was largely reduced under lockdown. Our investigation pointed to a different time course of sleep and mental health between genders during the home confinement period. Women seemed to show greater long-term resilience during the lockdown. Meanwhile, the male gender emerges as the most vulnerable category to the extension of the restraining measures. Our results suggest that there is no “weaker gender” after a prolonged lockdown. Indeed, the Italian population transversely presented signs of psychological suffering and significant sleep disturbances after the protracted and stressful lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100259,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100259,Scopus,10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100259,2020-11-01,,,

2121,"Immediate impact of stay-at-home orders to control COVID-19 transmission on socioeconomic conditions, food insecurity, mental health, and intimate partner violence in Bangladeshi women and their families: an interrupted time series","Background Stay-at-home orders (lockdowns) have been deployed globally to control COVID-19 transmission, and might impair economic conditions and mental health, and exacerbate risk of food insecurity and intimate partner violence. The effect of lockdowns in low-income and middle-income countries must be understood to ensure safe deployment of these interventions in less affluent settings. We aimed to determine the immediate impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders on women and their families in rural Bangladesh. Methods An interrupted time series was used to compare data collected from families in Rupganj upazila, rural Bangladesh (randomly selected from participants in a randomised controlled trial), on income, food security, and mental health a median of 1 year and 2 years before the COVID-19 pandemic to data collected during the lockdown. We also assessed women's experiences of intimate partner violence during the pandemic. Results Between May 19 and June 18, 2020, we randomly selected and invited the mothers of 3016 children to participate in the study, 2424 of whom provided consent. 2414 (99·9%, 95% CI 99·6–99·9) of 2417 mothers were aware of, and adhering to, the stay-at-home advice. 2321 (96·0%, 95·2–96·7) of 2417 mothers reported a reduction in paid work for the family. Median monthly family income fell from US$212 at baseline to $59 during lockdown, and the proportion of families earning less than $1·90 per day rose from five (0·2%, 0·0–0·5) of 2422 to 992 (47·3%, 45·2–49·5) of 2096 (p<0·0001 comparing baseline with lockdown period). Before the pandemic, 136 (5·6%, 4·7–6·6) of 2420 and 65 (2·7%, 2·1–3·4) of 2420 families experienced moderate and severe food insecurity, respectively. This increased to 881 (36·5%, 34·5–38·4) of 2417 and 371 (15·3%, 13·9–16·8) of 2417 during the lockdown; the number of families experiencing any level of food insecurity increased by 51·7% (48·1–55·4; p<0·0001). Mothers' depression and anxiety symptoms increased during the lockdown. Among women experiencing emotional or moderate physical violence, over half reported it had increased since the lockdown. Interpretation COVID-19 lockdowns present significant economic, psychosocial, and physical risks to the wellbeing of women and their families across economic strata in rural Bangladesh. Beyond supporting only the most socioeconomically deprived, support is needed for all affected families.

2123,"Knowledge, attitude, and practice among healthcare workers towards COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria","Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global pandemic. Healthcare workers' (HCWs) role in patient management is predisposing and can serve as means of hospitals and community transmission. This study evaluated HCWs' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in Nigeria. Methods we carried out a cross-sectional survey among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria from March to June 2020. The study assessed 346 HCWs for Knowledge, attitude, and practice by using an online (Google form) self-administered questionnaire, based on a convinience sampling technique Data were retrieved and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Chi-Square and one-way ANOVA were used to measure association and difference among demographic variables. The relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice was measured using Spearman's rho correlation test. Results the mean knowledge score of the HCWs was 7.1 on a scale of 0–8. The correct overall rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 88.75%. Knowledge was gained mainly from television (35.0%) and social media (35.0%). The mean attitude score on a scale of 0–6 was 5.31 ± 0.39. Most (92.5%) participants were confident that Nigerian medical scientists would win the war against COVID-19. The majority (92.2%) of the respondents thought that SARS-CoV-2 was not a biological weapon. About 1 out of 5 respondents held that faith healing or prayer is the only cure for COVID-19. A vast majority of the HCWs were taking precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded places (94.2%), washing of hands (96.0%), and the use of personal protective equipment (91.6%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, only 3 out of 5 HCWs used a face mask when leaving home. There was a significant (p = 0.046) positive correlation (0.584) between knowledge and attitude. Conclusion our results showed that HCWs in Nigeria had excellent knowledge and possessed a positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19. However; there were areas where poor knowledge, negative attitudes and unacceptable practices were observed.

Methods The authors invited licensed US dentists practicing primarily in private practice or public health to participate in a web-based survey in June 2020. Dentists from every US state (n = 2,195) answered questions about COVID-19–associated symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection, mental and physical health conditions, and infection control procedures used in their primary dental practices. Results Most of the dentists (82.2%) were asymptomatic for 1 month before administration of the survey; 16.6% reported being tested for SARS-CoV-2; and 3.7%, 2.7%, and 0% tested positive via respiratory, blood, and salivary samples, respectively. Among those not tested, 0.3% received a probable COVID-19 diagnosis from a physician. In all, 20 of the 2,195 respondents had been infected with SARS-CoV-2; weighted according to age and location to approximate all US dentists, 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.5) had confirmed or probable COVID-19. Dentists reported symptoms of depression (8.6%) and anxiety (19.5%). Enhanced infection control procedures were implemented in 99.7% of dentists’ primary practices, most commonly disinfection, COVID-19 screening, social distancing, and wearing face masks. Most practicing dentists (72.8%) used personal protective equipment according to interim guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Conclusions COVID-19 prevalence and testing positivity rates were low among practicing US dentists. This indicates that the current infection control recommendations may be sufficient to prevent infection in dental settings. Practical Implications Dentists have enhanced their infection control practices in response to COVID-19 and may benefit from greater availability of personal protective equipment.

2127,Direct and indirect effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Gaucher Disease patients in Spain: Time to reconsider home-based therapies?,"Objective An analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impact in the Spanish Gaucher Disease (GD) community is presented here. Patients & methods The Spanish GD foundation (FEETEF) surveyed 113 GD patients from March 30 to April 27; all patients provided a verbal consent. Results 110 surveys were analyzed. The median age was 47 years old (y.o.), 31 patients were ≥ 60 y.o.; and 34% of patients reported comorbidities. 46% (51/110) of patients were treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 48 of them at hospitals; 45.1% (45/110) were on substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 9% (10/110) receive no therapy. 25% (11/48) of ERT-hospital-based patients reported therapy interruptions, while SRT-patients did not report missing doses. No bone crises were reported. However, 50% (55/110) of patients reported being worried about their predisposition to a severe SARS-COV-2 infection and 29% (16/55) of them took anxiolytics or antidepressants for this. While 6 patients reported to have contact with an infected person, another two confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in splenectomyzed patients, one of them (a 79-year-old diabetic) died. Conclusions One quarter of the patients treated at hospitals reported dose interruptions. Home-based therapy may need to be considered in order to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcmd.2020.102478,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcmd.2020.102478,Scopus,10.1016/j.bcmd.2020.102478,2020-11-01,,,

Methods This exploratory study of 35 COVID-19 positive patients were enrolled between February 1 to March 1, 2020. Sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and social support were measured and social support related data of participants were collected. Psychological intervention was administered and patients were followed two weeks post intervention. Linear regression was performed to explore the relationship between psychosocial risk factors and improvement of psychological symptoms. Findings Thirty-two individuals exhibited sleep, depressive and anxiety symptoms which improved post support intervention. At baseline, symptoms were associated with gender, severity of pneumonia, social support.

2135,COVID-19-related conspiracy beliefs and their relationship with perceived stress and pre-existing conspiracy beliefs,"Previous studies have down that erroneous Conspiracy Theory (CT) beliefs develop more strongly in people who have underlying conspiratorial reasoning styles and psychopathological traits and particularly when they are faced with stressful external events (Swami et al., 2013; van Prooijen, 2018). In this study, we test this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 adults completed a survey that captured COVID–related CT beliefs and broader conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110201,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110201,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2020.110201,2020-11-01,,,

Intern-nursing students face challenges in providing care for suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19. This cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to explore the mental strain and changes in the psychological health hub among the intern-nursing students during COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 150 intern-nursing students from 13 pediatric and medical-surgical units at Alexandria University Hospitals completed the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19 Staff Questionnaire and rated their psychological distress on the General Health Questionnaire. Study results revealed that the most stressful factors were related to possibility of getting COVID-19 infection (2.89 ± 0.39) and transmitting it to their families (2.72 ± 0.62). Moreover, the availability of cure or vaccine for the disease was the most important motivational factor to participate in future outbreaks (2.64 ± 0.77). Regarding intern-nursing students' psychological health hub, 77.3% of them felt under strain, worthless and depressed (64.7%, 62.7%) since the influx of COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression indicated that students' age (23–24), clinical experience (8 months) and clinical placement in adults’ units served as risk factor for developing psychological distress while, male gender and training in pediatric units were protective factors.

Therefore, it is time to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on mental health. The current population-based study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression and PTSD of the quarantined people in Bangladesh during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods A total of 5792 individuals comprised the population of this study. Subjects were respondents to an online questionnaire that was administered through social media. The questionnaire included questions on personal information, quarantine related knowledge, items of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression (CES-D) scale. Data were collected and analyzed by regression utilizing a using IBM SPSS-22 (Statistical Package for Social Science, Chicago, IL, USA). Results The most post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms had on the male (n = 1392, 75.7%) who had institutional quarantine. The most depression symptoms were on the female (n = 920, 72.8%) whose income was more than 75000 takas in Bangladeshi currency. 81.8% of respondents had PTSD and their scores ≥24 in the IES-R scale. On the other hand, the respondent's income was 40000–74999 takas in Bangladesh currency had more PTSD symptoms and the odd ratio 19.3 (95% CI: 12.5–27.3), adjusted odds ratio 22.9 (95% CI: 15.6–32.4), after adjusting all personal variables. 85.9% respondents scored 16 ≤ in the CES-D scale, meaning they were depressed. The respondents whose education level grade 10 were most depressed and the odd ratio of 3.8 (95% CI: 3.1–4.65), adjusted odds ratio of 13.19 (95% CI: 9.88–17.62) after adjusting all personal variables.

2159,"Language teachers’ coping strategies during the Covid-19 conversion to online teaching: Correlations with stress, wellbeing and negative emotions","Teaching often is listed as one of the most stressful professions and being a language teacher triggers its own unique challenges. Responses to the Covid-19 pandemic have created a long list of new stressors for teachers to deal with, including problems caused by the emergency conversion to online language teaching. This article examines the stress and coping responses of an international sample of over 600 language teachers who responded to an online survey in April 2020. The survey measured stressors and 14 coping strategies grouped into two types, approach and avoidant. Substantial levels of stress were reported by teachers. Correlations show that positive psychological outcomes (wellbeing, health, happiness, resilience, and growth during trauma) correlated positively with approach coping and negatively with avoidant coping. Avoidant coping, however, consistently correlated (rs between 0.42 and 0.54) only with the negative outcomes (stress, anxiety, anger, sadness, and loneliness). In addition, ANOVA showed that although approach coping was consistently used across stress groups, avoidant coping increased as stress increased suggesting that there may be a cost to using avoidant coping strategies. Stepwise regression analyses using the 14 specific coping strategies showed a complex pattern of coping. Suggestions for avoiding avoidance coping strategies are offered.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.system.2020.102352,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.system.2020.102352,Scopus,10.1016/j.system.2020.102352,2020-11-01,,,

2163,Distance education as a response to pandemics: Coronavirus and Arab culture,"Some countries have replaced face-to-face education with distance education in response to the coronavirus. This form of distance education differs from conventional distance education: being suddenly, unreadily and forcefully implemented, invading schooling and constituting a globally discussed phenomenon. This article builds a conceptual framework for this education, addressing the question: What are the ramifications of implementing distance education amid coronavirus? It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations. Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews. Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour. Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education. Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching. Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts.

2231,The role of alexithymia in the mental health problems of home-quarantined university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China,"Objective While it is well known that mental health problems are common consequences of deadly pandemics, the association with alexithymia is less clear. This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCLC), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. Results It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. Conclusion These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in people with mental health problems.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110131,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110131,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2020.110131,2020-10-15,,,

2277,Prevalence and risk factors of COVID-19 suicidal behavior in Bangladeshi population: are healthcare professionals at greater risk?,"Background Current COVID-19 researches suggest that both general population and health-care providers (HCPs) are at risk of elevated psychological sufferings including suicidality. However, suicidality has not been addressed properly, although mental health problems are studied globally. Besides, the extreme fear of COVID-19 infection is being existed among the Bangladeshi HCPs, that is reported by a recent patients' suicide because of HCPs treatment negligence. Methods A web-based cross-sectional study was administered through the social media platforms. A total 3,388 respondents took part in the survey (mean age 30.1 ± 6.4 years) among them 834 were frontline HCPs (30.7 ± 5.6 years). The measures included socio-demographics, PPE-related and patient-care related information and a question concerned with the COVID-19 suicidal behavior. Results About 6.1% of the total participants had suicidal behavior, with no detectable differences within the groups (i.e., general population and HCPs). Regression analysis showed that being female, being divorced, and having no child were emerged as independent predictors for suicidality. There was no significant association between the PPE-related or patient-care related variables and suicidal behavior of the HCPs. Majority of the participants sometimes had fear of death although no significant relation of the factor was found with suicidality. Limitations The study can be limited because of its nature (i.e., cross-sectional self-reporting online survey) and not considering non-COVID-19 related suicide risk factors etc. Conclusions The present findings identified the substantial proportion of the HCPs and general population had COVID 19 related suicidal behavior. It can be used to advocate a large-scale suicide safety plan using a multidisciplinary approach herein.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05259,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05259,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05259,2020-10-01,,,

2324,University students’ changes in mental health status and determinants of behavior during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece,"Introduction : The aim of the study was to investigate mental health in university students in Greece, during lockdown due to COVID-19. Material and Methods : The data were collected online and anonymously, during lockdown; they included 1104 females (aged 22.08±4,96) and 431 males (aged 22.35±3.11). The analysis included transformation of the data with post-stratification method, descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Factorial Analysis of Variance and Relative Risk ratios Results : The results suggest that during, lockdown major depression was present in 12.43% with 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Risk factors were female sex, history of self-injury, suicidal attempts and following theoretical studies (RR=2–5.71). Conspiracy theories were accepted by 20–68%, with students of theoretical studies manifesting higher rates. Discussion : The results of the current study confirmed that students are at high risk to develop depression and suicidality in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. They also identified specific risk factors and pointed to the role of believing in conspiracy theories in copying with stress. They also identified populations with higher prevalence of these beliefs. Further targeted research is necessary as well as targeted intervention in vulnerable groups but concerning mental health as well as the reduction of believing in conspiracy theories.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113298,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113298,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113298,2020-10-01,,,

2368,Psychological status of healthcare workers during the civil war and COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study,"Objective Healthcare workers, particularly those working in departments that provide care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are at a higher risk of this contagious disease than those who work in other departments. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological status of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak, which has compounded Libya's existing civil war-related problems. Methods A multi-center cross-sectional survey on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and abuse was conducted. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers. Results The data of 745 eligible healthcare workers from 15 hospitals were analyzed. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were compared to the basic characteristics of the participants to determine the association. A total of 420 (56.3%) participants had depressive symptoms, while 348 (46.7%) had anxiety symptoms. Age, residency status, department, stigmatization, and living in a conflict zone were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Age, department, years of experience, working hours per week, internal displacement, stigmatization, living in a conflict zone, and verbal abuse were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Conclusion Our study presents important findings regarding depressive, anxiety symptoms, and abuse among physicians providing care during the COVID-19 outbreak and civil war in Libya.

2373,The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: A case-control study,"Background and objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. Methods This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. Results Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57–2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46–2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99–1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63–2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92–1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53–1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54–3.52) for mental problems. Limitations The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. Conclusions Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on the frontline.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.031,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.031,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.031,2020-10-01,,,

2377,Psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. The aim was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 95 RRMS patients were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. Results The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p<0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p<0.05). Conclusions There is an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of RRMS patients.

Methods A total of 7,202 adolescents aged 14–18 years completed online survceys from March 8 to 15, 2020, in China. Researchers assessed the associations between depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety symptoms (Chinese version of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and social support (Social Support Rate Scale). Results COVID-19 exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14–1.66) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04–1.52). Only 24.6% of adolescents reported high levels of social support. Most adolescents (70%) reported medium levels of support, and 5.4% reported low support. Low support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (OR = 4.24, 95% CI: 3.38–5.33) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.54–3.98), while controlling for gender, grade, living situation, and COVID-19 exposure; similarly, medium support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 2.48–3.15) and anxiety (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.94–2.48) symptoms. Conclusions This study indicates there is a higher prevalence of mental health problems among adolescents with medium and low levels of social support in China during the outbreak of COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.07.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.07.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.07.001,2020-10-01,,,
2392,Psychological impact of coronavirus disease (2019) (COVID-19) epidemic on medical staff in different posts in China: A multicenter study,"Objective An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a big challenge to medical staff and general public. The aim is to investigate psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on medical staff in different working posts in China, and to explore the correlation between psychological disorder and the exposure to COVID-19. Methods A multicenter WeChat-based online survey was conducted among medical staff in China between 26 February and 3 March 2020. Medical staff deployed to Hubei province from other provinces and medical staffs in different posts outside Hubei were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to the threat of COVID-19. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, stress and resilience were evaluated using scales including GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQI, PSS-14, and CD-RISC-10. Latent class analysis was performed to identify potential staff requiring psychological support. Results A total of 274 respondents were included, who serving at 4 posts as follows, staff backing Hubei province, isolation wards outside Hubei, fever clinic and infectious disease department, and other departments outside Hubei. The total scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and stress were statistically different among groups, meanwhile an increasing tendency of anxiety, depression and sleep quality scores with increasing risk of exposure to COVID-19 was found (p < 0.05). Subsequent post-hoc analysis indicated that the staff backing Hubei had higher scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and perceived stress (adjusted p < 0.05). The combined prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia of staff backing Hubei reached as high as 38%. Four-class latent class analysis showed 3 categories of population (69.4%) may need psychological support. Conclusions High prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia exist in medical staff related to COVID-19. The higher the probability and intensity of exposure to COVID-19 patients, the greater the risk that medical staff will suffer from mental disorders, suggesting continuous and proper psychiatric intervention are needed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.008,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.008,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.008,2020-10-01,,,

2403,Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety Levels and Related Factors Among Operating Theater Workers During the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"Purpose Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on health care workers because of the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019. This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among health care professionals working in operating theaters (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Design The universe of this descriptive study consisted of health care professionals working in operating theaters in various health care institutions in Turkey. Methods Data were collected online between April 9, 2020 and April 12, 2020 using a SurveyMonkey Questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) and health care workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. Findings A total of 702 health care professionals working in operating theaters participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.4 ± 4.6 (min 0 to max 21) and 10.0 ± 4.5 (min 0 to max 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60 years or older (P < .05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease, and those whose workload increased (P < .05). Conclusions The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among health care professionals working in operating theaters. To reduce these symptoms, psychological conditions of health care professionals can be followed continuously and regularly via standard procedures, and necessary interventions can be provided in the early period.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2020.06.017,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2020.06.017,Scopus,10.1016/j.jopan.2020.06.017,2020-10-01,,,

This study explored the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable patients with COVID-19. Methods This was an online survey conducted in COVID-19 patients across five designated isolation hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. Depression and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. Results A total of 770 participants were included. The prevalence of depression was 43.1% (95%CI: 39.6%-46.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis found that having a family member infected with COVID-19 (OR=1.51, P = 0.01), suffering from severe COVID-19 infection (OR=1.67, P = 0.03), male gender (OR=0.53, P<0.01), and frequent social media use to obtain COVID-19 related information (OR=0.65, P<0.01) were independently associated with depression. Patients with depression had lower QOL than those without. Conclusion Depression is highly prevalent in clinically stable patients with COVID-19. Regular screening and appropriate treatment of depression are urgently warranted for this population.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.033,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.033,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.033,2020-10-01,,,

2419,"Risk factors associated with mental illness in hospital discharged patients infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have a profound impact on the mental health of patients who survived the illness. However, little is known about the prevalence rate of mental health disorders among hospital discharged COVID-19 patients and its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey of hospital discharged patients was conducted April 11–22, 2020 in Wuhan, China (where the pandemic began). 675 participants completed the survey, including 90 (13.3%) medical staff (physicians and nurses who had been ill). We used Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms associated with COVID-19 hospitalization). Adverse mental health effects of COVID-19 are evident after discharge from the hospital, with sleep difficulties highlighted as a central issue. As we found that perceived discrimination was a central predictor of mental illness, preventing and addressing social stigma associated with COVID-19 may be crucial for improving mental health for recovered patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113297,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113297,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113297,2020-10-01,,,

2424,Sleep problems among Chinese adolescents and young adults during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic,"Objective To assess the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of insomnia symptoms among Chinese adolescents and young adults affected by the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Methods This cross-sectional study included Chinese adolescents and young adults 12–29 years of age during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, and to assess recognition of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. The Social Support Rate Scale was used to assess social support. Results Among 11,835 adolescents and young adults included in the study, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period was 23.2%. Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex and residing in the city were greater risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Depression or anxiety were risk factors for insomnia symptoms; however, social support, both subjective and objective, was protective factors against insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, anxiety and depression symptoms were mediators of social support and insomnia symptoms. Conclusions Results of this study revealed a high prevalence of sleep problems among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially senior high school and college students, which were negatively associated with students’ projections of trends in COVID-19. The adverse impact of COVID-19 was a risk factor for insomnia symptoms; as such, the government must devote more attention to sleep disorders in this patient population while combating COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.001,2020-10-01,,,

2430,"Factors related to mental health of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Objective To evaluate the mental health status of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to explore the related factors. Method This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants’ demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients’ self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients’ mental health. Results Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI ≥ 8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (IL)-1β and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients’ self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (β = 0.313, P < 0.001), self-perceived illness severity (β = 0.411, P < 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (β = 0.358, P = 0.002) had direct effects on patients’ mental health. The disease duration (β = 0.163, P = 0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (β = 0.101, P = 0.016) also indirectly affected patients’ mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. Conclusion A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients’ mental symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016,2020-10-01,,,

COVID-19 also has indirect effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food. We aimed to evaluate the perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free diet as a therapy. Methods We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) to answer an ad hoc COVID-19 survey. Results We sent the web survey to 651 email addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%). CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable because they had CeD (not at all 56.6%) and they did not worry much about the possible shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic (not at all 48.5%). The most worried were the elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities and females. Finally, CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them. Discussion The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD; in particular, women, elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities. COVID-19, although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of view, has offered an opportunity to practice, on a large-scale, a remote consultation approach for CeD healthcare.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.05.014,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.05.014,Scopus,10.1016/j.dld.2020.05.014,2020-10-01,,,

2438,Patient-reported Outcomes of Patients With Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Epicenter of China: A Cross-sectional Survey Study,"Introduction We aimed to analyze the psychological status in patients with breast cancer (BC) in the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients and Methods A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple BC centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and these included demographic information, clinical features, and 4 patient-reported outcome scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], and Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. Results Questionnaires were collected from February 16, 2020 to February 19, 2020, the peak time point of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Of patients with BC, 46.2% had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. Severe anxiety and severe depression were reported by 8.9% and 9.3% of patients, respectively. Severe distress and insomnia were reported by 20.8% and 4.0% of patients, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes, and close contact with patients with COVID-19 as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and central venous catheter flushing delay were factors that were independently associated with depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor. Poor physical condition and treatment discontinuation were underlying risk factors for distress based on multivariable analysis. Conclusion High rates of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia were observed in patients with BC during the COVID-19 outbreak. Special attention should be paid to the psychological status of patients with BC, especially those with poor general condition, treatment discontinuation, aggressive molecular subtypes, and metastatic BC.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.06.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.06.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.clbc.2020.06.003,2020-10-01,,,

2442,"Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms in response to COVID-19: A study of the general population in China at the peak of its epidemic","Rationale Psychological resilience is characterized as the ability to respond to extreme stress or trauma or adverse experience successfully. While the relation between public emergencies and psychological distress is well known, research on therelationship between psychological resilience and mental health is very limited during the outbreak of public health emergencies. Objective This research investigated the relationship between psychological resilience and mental health (depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms) among the general population in China. Method Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms of 1770 Chinese citizens were investigated during the epidemic peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (23rd February 2020 to 2nd March 2020). The analyses were done through the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale. Results The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms was found to be 47.1%, 31.9%, 45.9%, respectively, among all participants. From them, 18.2% showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression, 8.8% showed moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 16.6% showed moderate to severe symptoms of somatization. Psychological resilience was negatively correlated with depression (standardized β = −0.490, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized β = −0.443, P < 0.001), and somatization symptom scores (standardized β = −0.358, P < 0.001), while controlling for confounding factors. Analysis of the three-factor resilience structure showed that strength and tenacity were correlated with depression (standardized β = −0.256, P < 0.001; standardized β = −0.217, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized β = −0.268, P < 0.001; standardized β = −0.147, P < 0.001), and somatization symptoms (standardized β = −0.236, P < 0.001; standardized β = −0.126, P < 0.01). Conclusions Our results suggest that there is a high prevalence of psychological distresses among the general population at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which is negatively correlated with resilience. Psychological resilience represents an essential target for psychological intervention in a public health emergency.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113261,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113261,Scopus,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113261,2020-10-01,,,

2446,The relationship between physical activity and mental health in a sample of the UK public: A cross-sectional study during the implementation of COVID-19 social distancing measures,"Aim The aim of the present study was to investigate the cross-sectional association between physical activity levels with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and positive mental well-being in a sample of the UK public social distancing owing to COVID-19. Method This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study. Levels of physical activity during COVID-I9 social distancing were self-reported. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Participants also reported on sociodemographic and clinical data. The association between physical activity and mental health was studied using regression models. Results 902 adults were included in this study (63.8% of women and 50.1% of people aged 35–64 years). After adjusting for covariates, there was a negative association between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day in hours and poor mental health (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.80–0.97). Similar findings were obtained for moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms, moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms and poor mental wellbeing. Conclusions In the present sample of UK adults social distancing owing to COVID-19 those who were physically active have better overall mental health. Owing, to the cross-sectional design of the present study the direction of the association cannot be inferred.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2020.100345,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2020.100345,Scopus,10.1016/j.mhpa.2020.100345,2020-10-01,,,
2447,The care of kidney transplant recipients during a global pandemic: Challenges and strategies for success,"The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the novel beta coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), has become an unprecedented medical, economic, and psychosocial crisis. The pandemic and its management strategies have resulted in immense challenges for health systems, not only in caring for those with COVID-19 but also in the ongoing management of chronic medical conditions. Kidney transplant recipients present a unique challenge given their need for ongoing monitoring and management as well as their higher risk of COVID-19 infection. In the absence of clear guidelines, it is unclear how to best provide routine care to this unique patient population during the pandemic. Rigorous medical and psychosocial patient-centered risk stratification strategies are needed to avoid adverse outcomes in stable solid organ transplant recipients.

2448,Sleep quality and mental health in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Morocco,"Background The lockdown of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is associated with several stressful factors that can negatively affect peoples' sleep quality and mental health. Objectives: We conducted this study to evaluate sleep disorders and psychological impact associated with the spread of the COVID-19 and the lockdown on the Moroccan population. We also aimed to study the effects of respondents' beliefs and attitudes about sleep on sleep disorders, anxiety-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Material and Methods We used a questionnaire enclosing respondents' sociodemographic information, five psychological and behavioral tests including Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) test. Results Our results highlighted widespread false beliefs about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms within the Moroccan population. Nearly 82.3% of respondents revealed false beliefs about sleep. Furthermore, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms. However, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep and psychological disorders, between healthcare workers and other professions workers. Conclusion Our study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Moroccan population during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Moreover, false beliefs on sleep understanding were prevalent and were presenting a risk factor leading to sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.07.045,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.07.045,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.07.045,2020-10-01,,,
2449,An investigation of mental health status of children and adolescents in china during the outbreak of COVID-19,"Objective : The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a dramatic effect on the mental health of the public. In the present study, we demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with the epidemic . Methods : By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. Results : The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87 ± 15.79) and (29.27 ± 19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099–1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209–2.811), and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252–7.708). Two additional factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609–0.697) and tendency to apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923–0.951). Conclusion : Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on children and adolescents. Findings of current levels of anxiety and depression not only highlight the need to address emotional distress for children and adolescents during the epidemic but also provide researchers with scientific fundamentals to formulate targeted interventions based on the significant influencing factors.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.029,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.029,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.029,2020-10-01,,,
2450,Coping behaviors associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive symptoms, but some behaviors may protect against them. Method To provide a preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official lockdown was established across the country. Results Sixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors of lower levels of depressive symptoms. Limitations Cross-sectional nature and use of sample of convenience.

2455,Mental health among healthcare providers during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Saudi Arabia,"Background The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was recently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The first confirmed case in Saudi Arabia was announced on March 2, 2020. Several psychiatric manifestations may appear during pandemics, especially among frontline healthcare providers. Objectives This study sought to explore depression and anxiety levels among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 502 healthcare providers in the Ministry of Health. Depression and anxiety were assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. Results The respondents represented various healthcare occupations: administrators (28.49%), nurses (26.29%), physicians (22.11%), non-physician specialists (13.94%), technicians (6.77%), and pharmacists (2.30%). The majority of them were male (68.1%). More than half of them had depressive disorder (55.2%), which ranged from mild (24.9%), moderate (14.5%), and moderately severe (10%) to severe (5.8%). Half of the sample had generalized anxiety disorder (51.4%), which ranged from mild (25.1%) and moderate (11%) to severe (15.3%). Multivariate analysis showed that males were significantly less predicted to have anxiety (Beta=−0.22, P-value <0.04), 30–39 years age group were significantly more predicted to have depression and anxiety group (Beta=0.204, P-value <0.001 and beta=0.521, P-value <0.003 respectively), and nurses had significantly higher mean score of anxiety (Beta=0.445, P-value <0.026). Conclusions This study revealed that depression and anxiety are prevailing conditions among healthcare providers. Although efforts were accelerated to support their psychological well-being, more attention should be paid to the mental health of female, 30–39 age group and nursing staff. Promoting healthcare service as a humanitarian and national duty may contribute to making it a more meaningful experience in addition to advocating for solidarity, altruism, and social inclusion.

2456,The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the general population of Saudi Arabia,"Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging infection causing a widely spread pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. Methods During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: −2.79 to −0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: −2.50 to −0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: −4.44 to −0.42). Conclusion Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health.

In all electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented, and these key words were used: “COVID 19″ OR “SARS-CoV-2″ AND “psychological” OR “stress” OR “depression” AND “healthcare$”. We identified 6 studies, out of the final 15 selected, which reported numerical estimates for incidences of psychological effects. Meta-analysis was conducted, comparing both combined and individual effect sizes of all psychological manifestations. Qualitative evidence was reported from the remaining 9 cross- sectional studies. The summary effects of the combined quantitative meta-analysis conducted on 6 studies did indicate near significant differences between HCW and NHCW. Summary effects of individual manifestations indicated significantly higher incidence of insomnia among HCW, when compared to NHCW. Qualitative evidence from remaining cross-sectional studies provided additional information into the nature of the psychological issues. We conclude that even though reasons for psychological distress among HCW and NHCW may be different, both suffered in equal measures excepting for insomnia.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113360,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113360,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113360,2020-10-01,,,

2465,Modeling suicide risk among parents during the COVID-19 pandemic: Psychological inflexibility exacerbates the impact of COVID-19 stressors on interpersonal risk factors for suicide,"Public health researchers have raised the concern that both the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the ensuing public health response will increase interpersonal stressors associated with suicide risk. The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) framework conceptualizes psychological flexibility as an important way to reduce the impact of painful and even catastrophic events on psychological suffering. The current study examines psychological flexibility as a potential moderator of the prevailing interpersonal model of suicide risk. METHODS: A sample of 1003 parents (73% female, 82% Caucasian 86% in romantic relationships) were recruited as part of a larger study on the COVID-19 pandemic and family functioning from Mach 27th to the end of April 2020, the height of the United States’ “first wave.” Participants completed measures of psychological flexibility (the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility inventory; MPFI), interpersonal constructs (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness), desire for death, COVID-19 related stressors (resource strain and loss due to COVID-19). RESULTS: Moderated-mediation path models highlighted a significant indirect association between COVID-19 stressors and desire for death mediated by perceived burdensomeness to others. This indirect pathway was moderated by psychological inflexibility such that links were strongest at high levels of inflexibility and weak or non-significant at low levels of inflexibility. Results were generally consistent across five of the six facets of inflexibility. DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the value of targeting psychological inflexibility as an important strategy to reduce suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications of patterns of results across different facets for treatment approach are discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.003,2020-10-01,,,

2467,The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak,"The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069,Scopus,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069,2020-10-01,,,

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services have be constrained by infection control measures. We report a case of a 66-year-old female patient with a severe major depressive episode who had previously responded to right unilateral ECT and was treated with two modified accelerated intermittent theta-burst stimulation (aiTBS) protocols. Methods The two aiTBS courses consisted of eight daily sessions over five consecutive days, followed by gradual tapering, using 1,800 pulses per session pre-COVID-19 (first course), and 600 pulses per session during the pandemic (second course). Results Moderate to severe baseline depressive symptoms reached remission levels after both courses. Conclusion The 600-pulses aiTBS treatment protocol reported here warrants further study and evaluation, but may be a potential option in cases where older adults with severe depressive symptoms cannot access ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.007,2020-10-01,,,

2471,Can neuromodulation support the fight against the COVID19 pandemic? Transcutaneous non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation as a potential targeted treatment of fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome,"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread all over the world and caused a major health care crisis. About 20% of patients develop severe disease and require hospitalisation, which is associated with a high mortality rate of up to 97% in those being ventilated and respiratory failure being the leading cause of death. Despite many therapeutic agents being under current investigation there is yet no panacea available. With increasing rates of infection throughout the world, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches to counteract the infection. As the nervous system has shown to be a strong modulator of respiratory function and the immune response, we want to highlight pathways involved in regulation of respiratory function, the neuro-immune axis as well as the rationale for a potential targeted treatment of fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome via transcutaneous non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation in critically-ill COVID-19 patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110093,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110093,Scopus,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110093,2020-10-01,,,

As the geriatric population continues to grow in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, it is essential to explore the influence of this outbreak on geriatric mental health, a topic often neglected. In this review, we depict the status of geriatric psychiatry in the Arab countries of the MENA region, exploring the variations from one nation to another. While some have a null exposure to the field, resources and expertise in other countries range from very limited to extensive. Furthermore, we highlight the measures implemented in the Arab region to address mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak; these tend to be insufficient when targeting the geriatric population. Finally, we provide short- and long-term recommendations to stakeholders that aim at enhancing the mental healthcare of older adults in the Arab countries of the MENA region, particularly during this pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.009,2020-10-01,,,
2475,"Prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of depression in quarantined population during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background The COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, which may lead to depression. Therefore, this study aim to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in the general population quarantined during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen. Methods 2237 quarantined general individuals participated in this cross-sectional study from February 14 to March 4, 2020, during their 14 days quarantine. They completed the Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Results The prevalence of depressive symptom was 6.21% in quarantined individuals. The depressed group were younger, less married and educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p<0.05), as well as more avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p<0.05). Further multiple regression indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom. Limitations This study adopted a cross-sectional design and used self-report questionnaires.

2479,Drugs and the liver,"The liver is a major organ with multiple functions. A number of drugs are metabolized by the liver during phase 1 and 2 reactions which include complex processes involving cytochrome P450 enzymes. Genetic and acquired variability in cytochrome P450 activity may have profound effects on pharmacokinetics. Additionally, drugs can also modify how the liver functions and cause dysfunction or even failure of the organ both by a direct effect on the liver or by alteration in liver blood flow. It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of liver failure in patients and identify possible causes including drug interactions. Furthermore, once a patient has been recognized to be suffering with liver dysfunction or failure drug choice and dosing regime will need to be rationalized. Paracetamol overdose can have severe and life threatening consequences for patients due to its effect on liver function.

A total of 857 LGB people in Hong Kong participated in a community-based survey study. Over one-fourth of them met the criteria for probable clinical depression (31.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (27.9%). Besides general stressors, we identified sexual minority-specific stressors during the pandemic. 4.2% of the participants indicated that they had frequently experienced family conflict related to sexual orientation. One-third responded that they had largely reduced connection to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender plus (LGBT+) community (34.7%). The results showed that sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors explained significant variance in depressive and anxiety symptoms, above and beyond the contribution of general COVID-19-related stressors. Since LGB people are particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, LGB people-targeting organizations need to understand more about family, space, and privacy concerns in order to provide better support, and LGB safe spaces and shelters may be needed as a policy response.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365,2020-10-01,,,

Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002–2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. Methods We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. Results A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p = 0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19.

2486,"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom, and the demands for psychological knowledge and interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large cross-sectional study","Background : Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. Methods : A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. Results : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P = 0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P = 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P<0.001). Limitations : All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity.

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19–24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances.

Study design A cross-section survey-based study amongst doctors working within Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom. Results A total of 207 doctors completed the survey. Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. Conclusions Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors.

2491,Mental Health in Elderly Spanish People in Times of COVID-19 Outbreak,"Background We aim to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related emotional symptoms, identify gender differences, and study the relationship between the emotional state and environmental features in the elderly. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. Results One thousand six hundred thirty-nine (150 [9.2%] aged ≥60) participants completed the survey. The greater than or equal to 60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the less than 60 group (3.02 [3.28] versus 4.30 [4.93]); and lower mean (SD) acute stress disorder inventory scores than the less than 60 group (3.68 [3.20] versus 4.45 [3.06]). There were no gender differences in any of the clinical measures. The presence of economic losses as well as the increase in the use of anxiolytics was significantly associated with higher emotional distress in the elderly compared to the younger group.

2497,Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups,"Objective To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early convalescence in Shenzhen. Method A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. Results A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 ± 18.9, 47.3 ± 13.1, and 43.2 ± 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. Conclusion The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003,2020-10-01,,,

2499,"The anxiety levels, quality of sleep and life and problem-solving skills in healthcare workers employed in COVID-19 services","Objective The present study aims to investigate the level of anxiety experienced by healthcare workers employed in COVID-19 services, the effects of anxiety on sleep quality and quality of life and, the relationship between these variables and problem-solving skills of the healthcare workers. Material and method The study was conducted in two healthcare facilities which serve as pandemic hospitals. 140 healthcare workers, who were employed in the COVID-19 outpatient clinics or emergency departments, participated in the present study. All participants were submitted to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Problem Solving Inventory (PSI), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Findings The number of participants without anxiety was 41(29%), with mild anxiety was 53(38%). Clinically significant anxiety findings were found in only 33% of the participants. A positive correlation was found between the participants’ BAI scores and PSQI, PSI scores, and a negative correlation with the WHOQOL-BREF scores. PSQI and PSI scores of nurses were statistically higher when compared to those of physicians and staff. WHOQOL-BREF scores were found to be lower. Conclusion Healthcare workers might develop psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and sleep disturbance.

Depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, as well as COVID-19-related concerns, sleep problems, and quality of life were compared across the following pre-existing mental health groups: 1) no diagnosis, 2) suspected diagnosis, 3) diagnosed and untreated, and 4) diagnosed and treated. Compared to those without a diagnosis, the likelihood of scoring above the clinical threshold for those with a diagnosis - whether treated or not - was more than six-fold for depression, and four-to six-fold for anxiety and PTSD. Individuals with a suspected diagnosis were 3 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for depression and anxiety and 2 times more as likely to score above this threshold for PTSD compared to those with no diagnosis. We also present higher levels of COVID-19-related worry and grief, poorer sleep, and poorer reported health-related quality of life among those with either a suspected or reported mental health diagnosis.

2502,Anxiety and hopelessness levels in COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative study of healthcare professionals and other community sample in Turkey,"COVID-19 affected our mental health as well as our physical health. In this study, the anxiety and hopelessness levels of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and the factors affecting them were evaluated in Turkey. Beck Hopelessness Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was applied online to participants. Totally 2156 individuals were included in the study and 52.0% (n:1121) of them are healthcare workers. The hopelessness and state anxiety levels of healthcare workers were higher than non-healthcare workers. Nurses' hopelessness levels are higher than doctors, and state anxiety levels are higher than both doctors and other healthcare workers. Anxiety and hopelessness levels were higher in women, those living with a high-risk individual at home during the pandemic, those who had difficulty in caring for their children, and those whose income decreased. Anxiety levels are an important predictor of hopelessness. The increase in anxiety levels explained 28.9% of the increase in hopelessness levels. Increased working hours is one of the important factors affecting anxiety. As a conclusion, healthcare workers were more affected psychologically in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the society. Nurses were affected more than other healthcare workers. It is important to identify the factors affecting anxiety, hopelessness, and individuals who may be more psychologically affected during the pandemic. An important contribution can be made to the protection of public health by ensuring that psychosocial interventions for high-risk groups are planned in advance.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.024,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.024,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.024,2020-10-01,,,

2504,Influence of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of infertile couples,"Objective(s) to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infertile couples’ emotions, anxiety and future plans. Study design An observational study was perfomed by Italian ART centers and online forums. In this study, infertile couples candidate to ART and whose treatment was blocked due to the COVID-19 lockdown were enrolled through an online survey. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and by a short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Self-perceived anxiety related either to pregnancy safety and to economic crisis measured by VAS scale. Results 627 patients completed the survey. The COVID-19 lock-down had a moderate/severe psychological impact on infertile patients (mean IES-R score 36.4 ± 16.6). The mean STAI score was 49.8 ± 15.3, with an overall incidence of STAI > 36 of 71 %. The mean VAS scale for anxiety perception was 45.3 ± 15.3. Women were more emotionally distressed, anxious and depressed than men (36.8 ± 16.4 vs 31.0 ± 18.4 for IES-R, respectively; p = 0.03). Notwithstanding the uncertainty about pregnancy safety, 64.6 % of respondents chose to maintain their reproductive programme. Economic crisis induced 11.5 % of the surveyed patients to give up their ART program. Respondents who had at least one relative affected by COVID-19 had a significantly higher IES-R score and anxiety VAS, but not higher STAI scores, than patients belonging to unaffected families. Conclusion(s) COVID-19 pandemic itself and the recommendation to stop ART program generated higher distress levels in infertile couples. The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in infertility patients should not be underestimated, and a specific psychological support should be planned.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.08.025,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.08.025,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.08.025,2020-10-01,,,
2505,Facing new fears during the COVID-19 pandemic: The State of America's mental health,"Objective COVID-19 is rearranging our society with fear and worry about the novel coronavirus impacting the mental health of Americans. The current study examines the intersection of COVID-19 fear, worries and perceived threat with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences, namely anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Methods Using an online platform, a national sample (n = 10, 368) of U.S. adults was surveyed during the week of March 23, 2020. The sample was post-strata weighted to ensure adequate representation of the U.S. population based on population estimates for gender, race/ethnicity, income, age, and geography. Results Fear and worry are not distributed equally across the country; rather they are concentrated in places where the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is found. Additionally, data highlight significant differences in the subjective perception of distress across groups with varying social vulnerabilities. Women, Hispanics, Asians, families with children under 18, and foreign-born respondents reported higher levels of subjective fear and worry compared to their counterparts. Finally, even after controlling for social vulnerability, subjective assessments of distress were positive, and significantly related to anxiety and depressive symptomatology; prior mental health research from China and Europe confirm what others have begun to document in the United States. Conclusions This preliminary work provides practitioners with a glimpse of what lies ahead, which individuals and communities may be the most vulnerable, and what types of strategic interventions might help to address a wide range of mental health consequences for Americans in the months and years ahead.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102291,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102291,Scopus,10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102291,2020-10-01,,,

Data on the mental health status of these individuals during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs unclear. Method We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on April 1st 2020. Results Psychological distress was heightened in the mood disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and linked to higher levels of distress. Limitations Mood disorder was self-reported and was not clinically verified.

2511,Anxiety and depression in COVID-19 survivors: Role of inflammatory and clinical predictors,"Infection-triggered perturbation of the immune system could induce psychopathology, and psychiatric sequelae were observed after previous coronavirus outbreaks. The spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could be associated with psychiatric implications. We investigated the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in survivors, also considering the effect of clinical and inflammatory predictors. We screened for psychiatric symptoms 402 adults surviving COVID-19 (265 male, mean age 58), at one month follow-up after hospital treatment. A clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires were used to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. We collected sociodemographic information, clinical data, baseline inflammatory markers and follow-up oxygen saturation levels. A significant proportion of patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for depression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for OC symptoms, and 40% for insomnia. Overall, 56% scored in the pathological range in at least one clinical dimension. Despite significantly lower levels of baseline inflammatory markers, females suffered more for both anxiety and depression. Patients with a positive previous psychiatric diagnosis showed increased scores on most psychopathological measures, with similar baseline inflammation. Baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, positively associated with scores of depression and anxiety at follow-up. PTSD, major depression, and anxiety, are all high-burden non-communicable conditions associated with years of life lived with disability. Considering the alarming impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health, the current insights on inflammation in psychiatry, and the present observation of worse inflammation leading to worse depression, we recommend to assess psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors and to deepen research on inflammatory biomarkers, in order to diagnose and treat emergent psychiatric conditions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.037,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.037,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.037,2020-10-01,,,

2513,The Mental Health Benefits of Physical Activity in Older Adults Survive the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective To determine the relationship between the amount and intensity of physical activity performed by older adults in North America (United States and Canada) and their depression and anxiety symptoms while currently under social distancing guidelines (SDG) for the COVID-19 pandemic. Design Descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting Online survey conducted between April 9 and April 30, 2020, during the COVD-19 pandemic. Participants About 1,046 older adults over the age of 50 who live in North America. Measurements Participants were asked about their basic demographic information, current health status, and the impact of the current SDG on their subjective state of mental health. Participants completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity performed, as well as both the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Scale, to ascertain the extent of their depression and anxiety-like symptoms. Results Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that they adhered to current SDG “Most of the time” or “Strictly.” Participants who performed greater levels of physical activity experienced lower levels of depression-like symptoms when age, sex, and education were accounted for; however, no relationship between physical activity and anxiety-like symptoms was found. A hierarchical regression analysis that incorporated the intensity of physical activity performed (light, moderate, and vigorous) in the model indicated that greater light and strenuous activity, but not moderate, predicted lower depression-like symptoms. Conclusions These results suggest that performing even light physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may help alleviate some of the negative mental health impacts that older adults may be experiencing while isolated and adhering to SDG during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.024,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.024,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.024,2020-10-01,,,

2517,Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Subcontinent,"Background The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to the disease. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, compared with the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable increase in COVID infections with the gradual relaxation of lockdown continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on health care providers, especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. Methods An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID-specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operating theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice countrywide. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. Results A total of 176 responses were received from across the Indian subcontinent. The median age of respondents was 39 years (range, 32–70 years) and the postresidency experience was 7 years (range, 0–34 years). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. Of respondents, 46% were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (P = 0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services (26% vs. 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practiced precautionary measures in outpatient services (>60%). Although private practitioners were continuing elective cases (40%), public institutes were more cautious, with only emergency patients being operated on (29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to their family (75%). Social media were helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats on social media platforms (37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. Conclusions The survey highlights the perception of neurosurgeons toward the pandemic and the difference in public–private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal outpatient department/operating room practices, and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by personal protective equipment use and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Although telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, online education has been favorably received.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038,Scopus,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038,2020-10-01,,,
2518,Health-related quality of life and behavior-related lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 home confinement: Dataset from a Moroccan sample,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has caused a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1]. The disease is rapidly spread around the world causing thousands of deaths and posing critical challenges for public health and clinical research in the world. The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern. Nowadays, there are more than 18 millions of confirmed cases of coronavirus across the world with a total of 702,903 deaths [2]. In Morocco, there are 28,500 confirmed cases and 345 deaths. Forecasts for the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, active and death cases were recently provided [3]. To manage the pandemic spread several countries adopted proactive and preventive measures including home confinement of the population. However, there is evidence that these measures, particularly home confinement, can cause unprecedented disruption in the well-being of the population. Being forced to stay at home and the daily activities’ restrictions could impact the citizens’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavior-related lifestyle. It has been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on psychological behaviors [4], mental health [5] and anxiety/depression [6]. The Moroccan population was under home confinement from March 20, 2020. Assessing rapidly and simply the HRQoL during crisis such as the home confinement is a challenge of interest to provide speedy information to authorities which allow best management of damages yielding in crisis situation. The EQ-5D instrument is a generic questionnaire developed by the Euroqol group for measuring the HRQoL by combining five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) [7]. The EQ-5D instrument is translated into more than 300 languages and exhibit good reliability and validity in both patients and general population. Herein, we used the EQ-5D-5L instrument to assess for the first time the impact of the home confinement on the HRQoL. Also, we evaluated the changes in behaviors by asking some questions related to lifestyle before and during the home confinement. These data can help the Moroccan authorities and other countries to more understand the impact of this crisis on citizens and therefore to set up adequate protocols for managing the post-confinement or possible future crisis. We provided two datasets: (1) data we collected before confinement from a sample of 484 individuals describing their HRQoL [8] and (2) data we collected during the home confinement period from a sample of 537 individuals describing their HRQoL and behavior-related lifestyle.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.106239,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.106239,Scopus,10.1016/j.dib.2020.106239,2020-10-01,,,

Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English from database inception to March 9, 2020. We included randomised controlled trials investigating digital psychological interventions in individuals with mental health problems in LMICs. We extracted data on demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of the intervention, including the setting, digital delivery method, control group conditions, number of sessions, therapeutic orientation (eg, cognitive therapy or behaviour therapy), presence or absence of guidance, and length of follow-up, and statistical information to calculate effect sizes. If a study reported insufficient data to calculate effect sizes, the corresponding authors were contacted to provide data that could be aggregated. We did random-effects meta-analyses, and calculated the standardised mean difference in scores of digital psychological interventions versus control conditions (Hedges' g). Quality of evidence was assessed by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The primary outcome was post-intervention mental health problems, as measured by self-reporting instruments or clinical interviews. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019137755. Findings We identified 22 eligible studies that were included in the meta-analysis. The included studies involved a total of 4104 participants (2351 who received a digital psychological intervention and 1753 who were in the control group), and mainly focused on young adults (mean age of the study population was 20–35 years) with depression or substance misuse. The results showed that digital psychological interventions are moderately effective when compared with control interventions (Hedges' g 0·60 [95% CI 0·45–0·75]; Hedges' g with treatment as usual subgroup for comparison 0·54 [0·35–0·73]). Heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I 2=74% [95% CI 60–83]). There was no evidence of publication bias, and the quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria was generally high. Interpretation Digital psychological interventions, which have been mostly studied in individuals with depression and substance misuse, are superior to control conditions, including usual care, and are moderately effective in LMICs. However, the considerable heterogeneity observed in our analysis highlights the need for more studies to be done, with standardised implementation of digital psychological intervention programmes to improve their reproducibility and efficiency. Digital psychological interventions should be considered for regions where usual care for mental health problems is minimal or absent. Funding None.

2527,Neurological and neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19 in 153 patients: a UK-wide surveillance study,"Background Concerns regarding potential neurological complications of COVID-19 are being increasingly reported, primarily in small series. Larger studies have been limited by both geography and specialty. Comprehensive characterisation of clinical syndromes is crucial to allow rational selection and evaluation of potential therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the breadth of complications of COVID-19 across the UK that affected the brain. Methods During the exponential phase of the pandemic, we developed an online network of secure rapid-response case report notification portals across the spectrum of major UK neuroscience bodies, comprising the Association of British Neurologists (ABN), the British Association of Stroke Physicians (BASP), and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), and representing neurology, stroke, psychiatry, and intensive care. Broad clinical syndromes associated with COVID-19 were classified as a cerebrovascular event (defined as an acute ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or thrombotic vascular event involving the brain parenchyma or subarachnoid space), altered mental status (defined as an acute alteration in personality, behaviour, cognition, or consciousness), peripheral neurology (defined as involving nerve roots, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscle), or other (with free text boxes for those not meeting these syndromic presentations). Physicians were encouraged to report cases prospectively and we permitted recent cases to be notified retrospectively when assigned a confirmed date of admission or initial clinical assessment, allowing identification of cases that occurred before notification portals were available. Data collected were compared with the geographical, demographic, and temporal presentation of overall cases of COVID-19 as reported by UK Government public health bodies. Findings The ABN portal was launched on April 2, 2020, the BASP portal on April 3, 2020, and the RCPsych portal on April 21, 2020. Data lock for this report was on April 26, 2020. During this period, the platforms received notification of 153 unique cases that met the clinical case definitions by clinicians in the UK, with an exponential growth in reported cases that was similar to overall COVID-19 data from UK Government public health bodies. Median patient age was 71 years (range 23–94; IQR 58–79). Complete clinical datasets were available for 125 (82%) of 153 patients. 77 (62%) of 125 patients presented with a cerebrovascular event, of whom 57 (74%) had an ischaemic stroke, nine (12%) an intracerebral haemorrhage, and one (1%) CNS vasculitis. 39 (31%) of 125 patients presented with altered mental status, comprising nine (23%) patients with unspecified encephalopathy and seven (18%) patients with encephalitis. The remaining 23 (59%) patients with altered mental status fulfilled the clinical case definitions for psychiatric diagnoses as classified by the notifying psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrist, and 21 (92%) of these were new diagnoses. Ten (43%) of 23 patients with neuropsychiatric disorders had new-onset psychosis, six (26%) had a neurocognitive (dementia-like) syndrome, and four (17%) had an affective disorder. 18 (49%) of 37 patients with altered mental status were younger than 60 years and 19 (51%) were older than 60 years, whereas 13 (18%) of 74 patients with cerebrovascular events were younger than 60 years versus 61 (82%) patients older than 60 years. Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide, cross-specialty surveillance study of acute neurological and psychiatric complications of COVID-19. Altered mental status was the second most common presentation, comprising encephalopathy or encephalitis and primary psychiatric diagnoses, often occurring in younger patients. This study provides valuable and timely data that are urgently needed by clinicians, researchers, and funders to inform immediate steps in COVID-19 neuroscience research and health policy.

With the increasing number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths in Nigeria, the pandemic has led to massive public reactions. This data attempted to evaluate the knowledge, impacts, and government intervention during the pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a questionnaire shared via social media using a Snowball sampling technique. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA). A total of 387 responses was received. Results show that a significant number of respondents had adequate knowledge about COVID-19 modes of transmission, symptoms, and preventive measures. Respondents maintain personal hygiene as 67% wash their hands with soap. The pandemic has caused worry (65%), anxiety (42%), panic (35%), and depression (16%) among respondents, even as government intervention is seen as inadequate by 70%.

2532,Acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity: A review for emergency clinicians,"Background Acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity is characterized by a combination of direct cardiovascular effects and electrolyte derangements with resultant dysrhythmias and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Objective This review describes acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity, outlines the complex pathophysiologic derangements, and addresses the emergency department (ED) management of this patient population. Discussion Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are aminoquinoline derivatives widely used in the treatment of rheumatologic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis as well as for malaria prophylaxis. In early 2020, anecdotal reports and preliminary data suggested utility of hydroxychloroquine in attenuating viral loads and symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aminoquinoline drugs pose unique and significant toxicological risks, both during their intended use as well as in unsupervised settings by laypersons. The therapeutic range for chloroquine is narrow. Acute severe toxicity is associated with 10–30% mortality owing to a combination of direct cardiovascular effects and electrolyte derangements with resultant dysrhythmias. Treatment in the ED is focused on decontamination, stabilization of cardiac dysrhythmias, hemodynamic support, electrolyte correction, and seizure prevention. Conclusions An understanding of the pathophysiology of acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity and available emergency treatments can assist emergency clinicians in reducing the immediate morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.07.030,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.07.030,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.07.030,2020-10-01,,,
2533,Dexmedetomidine and worsening hypoxemia in the setting of COVID-19: A case report,"Emergency department management of hypoxemia in the setting of COVID-19 is riddled with uncertainty. The lack of high-quality research has translated to an absence of clarity at the bedside. With disease spread outpacing treatment consensus, provider discretion has taken on a heightened role. Here, we report a case of dexmedetomidine use in the setting of worsening hypoxemia, whereby oxygenation improved and intubation was avoided. Well known pharmacologic properties of the drug, namely the lack of respiratory depression and its anti-delirium effects, as well as other possible physiologic effects, suggest potential benefit for patients being managed with a delayed intubation approach. If dexmedetomidine can improve compliance with non-invasive oxygen support (the current recommended first-line therapy) while promoting better oxygenation, it may also decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and thus improve mortality.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.066,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.066,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.066,2020-10-01,,,

2562,Psychological inflexibility and intolerance of uncertainty moderate the relationship between social isolation and mental health outcomes during COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on human activity worldwide, in part due to many governments issuing stay-at-home orders and limiting the types of social interactions in which citizens can engage. Previous research has shown that social isolation can contribute to psychological distress. The impact of increased social isolation on mental health functioning during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as potential mechanisms to buffer this impact, have yet to be investigated. The current study explored the moderating role of psychological flexibility and related constructs on the relationships between social isolation and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data from 278 participants, the majority residing in the United States, were collected during a 3-week period from mid-April to early May 2020 via online survey. A series of hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated statistically significant relationships between social isolation and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress), well-being, and valued living. Psychological inflexibility, intolerance of uncertainty, and emotional suppression significantly moderated these relationships in a number of instances. Greater psychological flexibility and acceptance of difficult experiences appeared to act as a buffer against the negative effects of increased social isolation, while amplifying the benefits of social connectedness. Implications for promoting mental health and buffering against the harmful effects of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond are discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.005,2020-10-01,,,

2571,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study,"COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant mental health threat among children in Bangladesh. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children during the lockdown in Bangladesh. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th April to 9th May 2020 among 384 parents having at least one child aged between 5–15 years using non-probability sampling. K-means clustering used to group children according to mental health score and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) performed to identify the relationship among the parental behavior and child mental health, and also these associations were assessed through chi-square test. Children were classified into four groups where 43% of child had subthreshold mental disturbances (mean Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)-10; 2.8), 30.5% had mild (mean MDD-10; 8.9), 19.3% suffered moderately (mean MDD-10; 15.9), and 7.2% of child suffered from severe disturbances (mean MDD-10; 25.2). The higher percentage of mental health disturbances of children with the higher education level of parents, relative infected by COVID-19 (yes), parents still need to go the workplace (yes), and parent’s abnormal behavior but lower to their counterparts. This paper demonstrates large proportions of children are suffering from mental health disturbances in Bangladesh during the period of lockdown. Implementation of psychological intervention strategies and improvement in house-hold financial conditions, literacy of parents, taking care of children, and job security may help in improving the psychological/mental status of children and the authors believe that the findings will be beneficial to accelerate the rate of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) linked to health status in Bangladesh.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105277,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105277,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105277,2020-10-01,,,

The study aims to analyze variables associated with the community psychosocial burden (anxiety level) during the co-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Methods This study collected data (n = 8,031) online. Psychosocial burden was measured based on the anxiety level which include 5 aspects, such as economic, religious, educational, employment, and social issues. Each question used a Likert scale. Six independent were examined, such as age, gender, religion, marital, education, and employement. In the final stage, a multivariate test was performed using a multinomial logistic regression. Results Someone older experienced less high anxiety. The age group of 20–29 years was 4,330 times likely to experience higher anxiety than the age group of ≥50 years. While, those in the age group of 40–49 years weer 2,322 times more likely to have higher anxiety than those in the age group of ≥50 years. Male respondents had lower possibility of medium to high anxiety than females. Respondents with secondary and lower education had 3,117 times possibilities to experience higher anxiety than those with high education level. Conclusion Four variables affected the psychosocial burden i.e, anxiety level of community in Indonesia. These involved age, gender, education, and employement.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05136,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05136,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05136,2020-10-01,,,

2632,Drug treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.,"Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout China as well as other countries. More than 8,700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been recorded worldwide so far, with much more cases popping up overseas than those inside. As the initial epicenter in the world, China has been combating the epidemic for a relatively longer period and accumulated valuable experience in prevention and control of COVID-19. This article reviewed the clinical use, mechanism and efficacy of the clinically approved drugs recommended in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (DTPNCP) released by National Health Commission of P.R.China, and the novel therapeutic agents now undergoing clinical trials approved by China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to evaluate experimental treatment for COVID-19. Reviewing the progress in drug development for the treatment against COVID-19 in China may provide insight into the epidemic control in other countries.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173326,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173326,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173326,2020-09-15,,,
2633,Is Increased Sleep Responsible for Reductions in Myocardial Infarction During the COVID-19 Pandemic?,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus has had devastating consequences across the globe. However, multiple clinics and hospitals have experienced a decrease in rates of acute myocardial infarction and corresponding cardiac catheterization lab activations, raising the question: Has the risk of myocardial infarction decreased during COVID? Sleep deprivation is known to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, and sleep has been importantly impacted during the pandemic, possibly due to the changes in work-home life leading to a lack of structure. We conducted a social media-based survey to assess potential mechanisms underlying the observed improvement in risk of myocardial infarction. We used validated questionnaires to assess sleep patterns, tobacco consumption and other important health outcomes to test the hypothesis that increases in sleep duration may be occurring which have a beneficial impact on health. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic led to shifts in day/night rhythm, with subjects waking up 105 minutes later during the pandemic (p <0.0001). Subjects also reported going to sleep 41 minutes later during the pandemic (p <0.0001). These shifts led to longer duration of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, subjects reported sleeping 6.8 hours per night, which rose to 7.5 hours during the pandemic, a 44 minute or 11% increase (p <0.0001). We acknowledge the major negative health impact of the global pandemic but would advocate for using this crisis to improve the work and sleep habits of the general population, which may lead to overall health benefits for our society.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2020.06.027,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2020.06.027,Scopus,10.1016/j.amjcard.2020.06.027,2020-09-15,,,
2634,The psychosocial implications of COVID-19 for a neurology program in a pandemic epicenter,"Objective We discuss the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as self-reported by housestaff and faculty in the NYU Langone Health Department of Neurology, and summarize how our program is responding to these ongoing challenges. Methods During the period of May 1–4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. Results Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion COVID-19 has affected the lives and minds of faculty and housestaff in our neurology department at the epicenter of the pandemic. Efforts to support these providers during this evolving crisis are imperative for promoting the resilience necessary to care for our patients and colleagues.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034,Scopus,10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034,2020-09-15,,,

2653,"Effective block by pirfenidone, an antifibrotic pyridone compound (5-methyl-1-phenylpyridin-2[H-1]-one), on hyperpolarization-activated cation current: An additional but distinctive target","Pirfenidone (PFD), a pyridone compound, is well recognized as an antifibrotic agent tailored for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I h) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of the current in pituitary GH3 cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased I h amplitude further. The presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in I h activation curve without changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor erg-mediated K+ current was altered by its presence. In whole-cell potential recordings, addition of PFD reduced the firing frequency, and this effect was accompanied by the depression in the amplitude of sag voltage elicited by hyperpolarizing current stimulus. Overall, this study highlights evidence that PFD is capable of perturbing specific ionic currents, revealing a potential additional impact on functional activities of different excitable cells.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173237,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173237,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173237,2020-09-05,,,

2709,Adolescent psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown,"The aim of this paper was to review the literature on adolescent psychiatric disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Stressful life events, extended home confinement, brutal grief, intrafamilial violence, overuse of the Internet and social media are factors that could influence the mental health of adolescents during this period. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased psychiatric disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress, Depressive, and Anxiety Disorders, as well as grief-related symptoms. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders are at risk of a break or change in their care and management; they may experience increased symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may have a negative impact on the mental health of adolescents, although there is still no data on the long term impact of this crisis. Adolescents’ individual, familial, and social vulnerability, as well as individual and familial coping abilities, are factors related to adolescent mental health in times of crisis. Adolescents are often vulnerable and require careful consideration by caregivers and healthcare system adaptations to allow for mental health support despite the lockdown. Research on adolescent psychiatric disorders in times of pandemics is necessary, as such a global situation could be prolonged or repeated.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113264,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113264,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113264,2020-09-01,,,

2720,Dynamic Diffusion Network: Advancing moral injury care and suicide prevention using an innovative model,"Healthcare providers across a wide variety of settings face a common challenge: the need to provide real time care for complex problems that are not adequately addressed by existing protocols. In response to these intervention gaps, frontline providers may utilize existing evidence to develop new approaches that are tailored to specific problems. It is imperative that such approaches undergo some form of evaluation, ensuring quality control while permitting ongoing adaptation and refinement. “Dynamic diffusion” is an innovative approach to intervention improvement and dissemination whereby care practices are delivered and continuously evaluated under real-world conditions as part of a structured network experience. This “dynamic diffusion network” (DDN) promotes cross-pollination of ideas and shared learning to generate relatively rapid improvements in care. The pilot Mental Health and Chaplaincy DDN was developed to advance suicide prevention efforts and moral injury care practices being conducted by 13 chaplain-mental health professional teams across the Veterans Health Administration. Lessons learned from the pilot DDN include the importance of the following: geographic and cultural diversity among innovation collaborators to ensure the broadest possible relevance of solutions; leadership support to facilitate engagement of frontline providers in quality improvement efforts; and participation in a community of practice to motivate providers and offer opportunities for direct collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hjdsi.2020.100440,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hjdsi.2020.100440,Scopus,10.1016/j.hjdsi.2020.100440,2020-09-01,,,

2725,"Clinical, molecular, and epidemiological characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a comprehensive literature review","Coronaviruses are an extensive family of viruses that can cause disease in both animals and humans. The current classification of coronaviruses recognizes 39 species in 27 subgenera that belong to the family Coronaviridae. From those, at least 7 coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections in humans. Four of these viruses can cause common cold-like symptoms. Those that infect animals can evolve and become infectious to humans. Three recent examples of these viral jumps include SARS CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 virus. They are responsible for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the most recently discovered coronavirus disease during 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. The rapid spread of the disease has taken the scientific and medical community by surprise. Latest figures from 20 May 2020 show more than 5 million people had been infected with the virus, causing more than 330,000 deaths in over 210 countries worldwide. The large amount of information received daily relating to COVID-19 is so abundant and dynamic that medical staff, health authorities, academics and the media are not able to keep up with this new pandemic. In order to offer a clear insight of the extensive literature available, we have conducted a comprehensive literature review of the SARS CoV-2 Virus and the Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19).",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115094,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115094,Scopus,10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115094,2020-09-01,,,

2744,"Experiences of American Older Adults with Pre-existing Depression During the Beginnings of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicity, Mixed-Methods Study","Objective To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. Design and Measurements During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Results Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Conclusion Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013,2020-09-01,,,

2759,The psychological and mental impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on medical staff and general public – A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused enormous psychological impact worldwide. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures. In conclusion, psychological interventions targeting high-risk populations with heavy psychological distress are in urgent need.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113190,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113190,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113190,2020-09-01,,,

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately affected marginalized populations. Older adults, people experiencing unstable housing, racial and ethnic minorities, and immigrants are potentially at increased risk for infection and severe complications from COVID-19. The direct and societal effects of the pandemic may increase risk of incident kidney disease and lead to worse outcomes for those with kidney disease. The rapid transition to telemedicine potentially limits access to care for older adults, immigrants, and people experiencing unstable housing. The economic impact of the pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on women, minorities, and immigrants, which may limit their ability to manage kidney disease and lead to complications or kidney disease progression.

2790,"The effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity on mental health during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown in Austria","Background The impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the governmental restrictions on mental health have been reported for different countries. This study evaluated mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity. Methods An online survey was performed through Qualtrics® after four weeks of lockdown in Austria to recruit a representative sample regarding gender, age, education, and region. Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). Results In total, N = 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off ≥10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off ≥10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off ≥15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia. ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests showed highest mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values <.05). Comparisons with a large Austrian sample recruited within the ATHIS 2014 study showed increases of depression and decreases of quality of life in times of COVID-19 as compared to before COVID-19. Conclusions Depressive symptoms (21%) and anxiety symptoms (19%) are higher during COVID-19 compared to previous epidemiological data. 16% rated over the cut-off for moderate or severe clinical insomnia. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown seems particularly stressful for younger adults (<35 years), women, people without work, and low income.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110186,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110186,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110186,2020-09-01,,,
2791,Special ambulatory gynecologic considerations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implications for future practice,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006,2020-09-01,,,

2807,"Investigating mediated effects of fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 misunderstanding in the association between problematic social media use, psychological distress, and insomnia","Introduction Due to the serious situation of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, many countries have implemented policies to minimize the spread of COVID-19 infection. However, some of these policies prevent people from physical contact. Consequently, many individuals may rely on social media to obtain information concerning COVID-19. Unfortunately, social media use (especially problematic social media use) may give rise to psychological distress. Therefore, this study thus examined potential psychopathology to explain the association between problematic social media use, psychological distress, and insomnia. Methods Utilizing an online survey, a sample of Iranian young adults (n = 1078 with 628 males; mean age = 26.24 years [SD ± 7.41]) completed questions and psychometric scales concerning psychological distress, insomnia, problematic social media use, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19 misunderstanding. Results Problematic social media use was significantly associated with psychological distress both directly and indirectly. The indirect effects were through fear of COVID-19 (unstandardized coefficient [B] = 0.177; Bootstrapping SE = 0.026) and COVID-19 misunderstanding (B = 0.060; Bootstrapping SE = 0.014). Problematic social media use was significantly associated with insomnia both directly and indirectly. The indirect effect was through fear of COVID-19 (B = 0.062; Bootstrapping SE = 0.019) but not COVID-19 misunderstanding (B = 0.012; Bootstrapping SE = 0.014). Discussion/conclusion Due to the pressure of the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals are highly likely to develop psychological distress and insomnia. Apart from developing appropriate health policies to minimize the spread of COVID-19 infection, healthcare providers should design appropriate online campaigns to eliminate people's fear of COVID-19 and to diminish misunderstanding concerning COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100345,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100345,Scopus,10.1016/j.invent.2020.100345,2020-09-01,,,

In one study, nurses had twice the rate of depression compared with other health care professionals. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, burnout is a major threat to the stability of the workforce on the front lines. Consultation-liaison (C/L) psychiatry can provide assistance through liaison meetings, stress management programs, and curbside consults to help reduce the risk of burnout. Narrative medicine programs, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and meditation apps are additional means to alleviate stress. Given the current challenges facing C/L psychiatry and the mental health field in general, there is an urgent need to overcome stigma and financial barriers to make treatment readily accessible.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jradnu.2020.06.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jradnu.2020.06.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.jradnu.2020.06.004,2020-09-01,,,

We aimed to describe the typical presentation and outcomes of children diagnosed with this hyperinflammatory condition. Methods We conducted a systematic review to communicate the clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging results, and outcomes of individuals with MIS-C. We searched four medical databases to encompass studies characterizing MIS-C from January 1st, 2020 to July 25th, 2020. Two independent authors screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. This review was registered with PROSPERO CRD42020191515. Findings Our search yielded 39 observational studies (n = 662 patients). While 71·0% of children (n = 470) were admitted to the intensive care unit, only 11 deaths (1·7%) were reported. Average length of hospital stay was 7·9 ± 0·6 days. Fever (100%, n = 662), abdominal pain or diarrhea (73·7%, n = 488), and vomiting (68·3%, n = 452) were the most common clinical presentation. Serum inflammatory, coagulative, and cardiac markers were considerably abnormal. Mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were necessary in 22·2% (n = 147) and 4·4% (n = 29) of patients, respectively. An abnormal echocardiograph was observed in 314 of 581 individuals (54·0%) with depressed ejection fraction (45·1%, n = 262 of 581) comprising the most common aberrancy. Interpretation Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a new pediatric disease associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is dangerous and potentially lethal.

2817,COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry,"Background : The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions. Methods : We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Case-centered recommendations : Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25–50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. Limitations : Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. Conclusions : Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.149,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.149,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.149,2020-09-01,,,

2838,COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults,"Background COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity Methods Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. Results COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitations Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. Conclusions Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.080,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.080,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.080,2020-09-01,,,
2839,Prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among Chinese returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objectives The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a severe global crisis which has resulted in many public health problems. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Our online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged ≥17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5th to 14th March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score>5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. Results In sum near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3 ± 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%–16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0 ± 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6 ± 1.2 h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. Conclusions Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was sent to patients who attended a large university-affiliated infertility practice in the USA between 1 January 2019 and 1 April 2020. At three different time-points respondents were asked to note their top three stressors, from a list of 10 commonly reported life stressors. Results The questionnaire was sent to 10,481 patients, with 3604 responses (response rate 34%) received. A total of 2202 non-pregnant female respondents were included in the final analysis. One-third of respondents had a prior diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and 11% reported taking anxiolytic medications; over one-quarter had a prior diagnosis of a depressive disorder and 11% reported taking antidepressant medications. At all three time-points, infertility was noted to be the most frequent top stressor. Coronavirus was noted to be the third most common stressor among the respondents in early March but, at the time of writing, is similar to that of infertility (63% and 66%, respectively). A total of 6% of patients stated that infertility treatment, including IVF, should not be offered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Study design Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Results Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%). The left ventricular ejection fraction normalized in 95% of those with a depressed ejection fraction.

We characterized distress, coping, and preferences for support among NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a cross-sectional web survey of physicians, advanced practice providers, residents/fellows, and nurses, conducted during a peak of inpatient admissions for COVID-19 in NYC (April 9th–April 24th 2020) at a large medical center in NYC (n = 657). Results Positive screens for psychological symptoms were common; 57% for acute stress, 48% for depressive, and 33% for anxiety symptoms. For each, a higher percent of nurses/advanced practice providers screened positive vs. attending physicians, though housestaff's rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from either. Sixty-one percent of participants reported increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 outbreak. Physical activity/exercise was the most common coping behavior (59%), and access to an individual therapist with online self-guided counseling (33%) garnered the most interest. Conclusions NYC HCWs, especially nurses and advanced practice providers, are experiencing COVID-19-related psychological distress. Participants reported using empirically-supported coping behaviors, and endorsed indicators of resilience, but they also reported interest in additional wellness resources.

This study investigated their experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic via Q Chat Space—a national online chat-based support program. Methods Transcript data from 31 synchronous, text-based chats collected during the onset of state-based “social distancing” ordinances in Spring 2020 were analyzed. Results While encountering COVID-19–related stressors likely to be experienced by youth generally, participants' experiences were concomitantly imbued with LGBTQ-specific intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural challenges. Difficulties included maintaining mental health, being isolated with unsupportive families, and loss of in-person identity-based socialization and support. Conclusions Findings highlight the importance of synchronous, text-based online platforms to enable LGBTQ youth to feel safe to seek support while at home. Given the potential for long-term physical distancing, concerted efforts are required to provide necessary resources and support for LGBTQ youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.002,2020-09-01,,,

2857,"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Examining Changes in Frequency, Social Contexts, and Pandemic-Related Predictors","Purpose The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing. Methods Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, M age = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. Results For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. Conclusions Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018,2020-09-01,,,

2859,A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041,Scopus,10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041,2020-09-01,,,

2861,High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the covid-19 crisis,"To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression (p = .005) and anxiety (p = .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents’ activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294,2020-09-01,,,

The objective of this paper is to present first impressions of this transformation. Methods Using over-the-phone instructions initially, all patients were able to participate with the online therapy program. To reduce screen-time for patients, the nonverbal therapies were shortened. Four patients, aged 64–70 years, started our online program. Results Therapists were positive about the online capabilities and resilience of patients to adapt to the new situation. Prejudices on limited effectiveness of online psychotherapy were counteracted. Sending homework by email and mail seems to facilitate therapy adherence.

Methods Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the “comparison period” (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the “COVID-19 pandemic” (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100327,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100327,Scopus,10.1016/j.invent.2020.100327,2020-09-01,,,

2870,Signal of increased opioid overdose during COVID-19 from emergency medical services data,"Background Individuals with opioid use disorder may be at heightened risk of opioid overdose during the COVID-19 period of social isolation, economic distress, and disrupted treatment services delivery. This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Methods We evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020. Results Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period. Conclusions This Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108176,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108176,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108176,2020-09-01,,,
2871,Conducting research in Radiation Oncology remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic: Coping with isolation,"Introduction With the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have been forced to follow strict social isolation guidelines. While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. Materials and methods An online survey was conducted between March 27th and April 5th, 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt. Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. Conclusion Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2020.06.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2020.06.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.ctro.2020.06.006,2020-09-01,,,

Método Participan 1.501 personas (rango de edad: 18 a 88 años). Se evaluaron el grado de ansiedad, tristeza y soledad, y la autopercepción del envejecimiento. Se dividió a la muestra en función del grupo de edad y por cuartiles (bajo, intermedios y alto) en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y autopercepción del envejecimiento. Resultados Las personas mayores informan de menor ansiedad y tristeza que los de mediana edad y jóvenes, y los de mediana edad de menores niveles que los jóvenes. Los de mediana edad informan de menor soledad, seguidos de los mayores y los jóvenes. Para cada grupo de edad, aquellos con una alta autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento informan de mayor ansiedad, tristeza y soledad. Hay más comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva en jóvenes y menos en mayores; más personas deprimidas en mediana edad, menos mayores con ansiedad, y más mayores y menos jóvenes sin sintomatología ansiosa y depresiva. Para todos los grupos de edad, las personas con comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva son las que tienen puntuaciones altas en autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento.

Method Participants are 1501 people (age range 18 to 88 years). Anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging were assessed. The sample was divided according to the age group and quartiles (lower, intermediate levels, and higher) of anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging. Results Older adults reported lower levels of anxiety and sadness than middle aged adults, and middle aged adults reported lower levels than younger participants. Middle aged adults reported the lowest loneliness, followed by older adults and younger participants. For each age group, those with more negative self-perceptions of aging reported higher anxiety, sadness and loneliness. More comorbid anxiety and sadness was found in younger adults and less in older adults; more depressed participants in the middle aged group, and more older adults and less younger participants were found in the group with the lowest levels of anxiety and sadness. For all the age groups, participants with high levels of comorbid anxiety and sadness are those who report the highest scores in negative self-perceptions of aging.

2877,Maternal choline and respiratory coronavirus effects on fetal brain development: Prenatal coronavirus and choline fetal brain effects,"Prenatal COVID-19 infection is anticipated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to affect fetal development similarly to other common respiratory coronaviruses through effects of the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Plasma choline levels were measured at 16 weeks gestation in 43 mothers who had contracted common respiratory viruses during the first 6–16 weeks of pregnancy and 53 mothers who had not. When their infants reached 3 months of age, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R), which assesses their infants’ level of activity (Surgency), their fearfulness and sadness (Negativity), and their ability to maintain attention and bond to their parents and caretakers (Regulation). Infants of mothers who had contracted a moderately severe respiratory virus infection and had higher gestational choline serum levels (≥7.5 mM consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration dietary recommendations) had significantly increased development of their ability to maintain attention and to bond with their parents (Regulation), compared to infants whose mothers had contracted an infection but had lower choline levels (<7.5 mM). For infants of mothers with choline levels ≥7.5 μM, there was no effect of viral infection on infant IBQ-R Regulation, compared to infants of mothers who were not infected. Higher choline levels obtained through diet or supplements may protect fetal development and support infant early behavioral development even if the mother contracts a viral infection in early gestation when the brain is first being formed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.019,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.019,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.019,2020-09-01,,,
2878,"Time from COVID-19 shutdown, gender-based violence exposure, and mental health outcomes among a state representative sample of California residents","Background There is increasing evidence of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant shutdowns on mental health. This issue may be of particular concern to those affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a California state-representative online survey conducted in the two weeks following the state stay-at-home order, enacted March 19, 2020 (unweighted N = 2081). We conducted a series of multivariate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the associations between a) time since stay-at-home order and b) partner and sexual violence exposure ever with our outcomes of interest: depression and/or anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks. Covariates included demographics and social support. Findings Nearly one in five (19•7%) respondents reported moderate or severe mental health symptoms in the past two weeks; 15•5% had a history of IPV and 10•1% had a history of sexual violence. In models adjusting for gender, partner and sexual violence history, and other demographics, time was significantly associated with greater mental health symptom severity, as were IPV and sexual violence. When we additionally adjusted for current social support, effects of time were lost and effects related to violence were slightly attenuated. Interpretation Time under shutdown is associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety symptoms, and may be worse for those with a history of IPV. However, those with greater social support appear to have better capacity to withstand the mental health impacts of the pandemic. Social support programs, inclusive of those available virtually, may offer an important opportunity to help address increased mental health concerns we are seeing under the pandemic.

2882,Optimism and COVID-19: A resource to support people in confinement?,"Ce texte envisage de porter un regard sur les conséquences psychologiques de la situation sanitaire liée au COVID-19 à partir du concept d’optimisme. Depuis plusieurs années, la psychologie positive s’est saisie de cette notion déjà bien connue du grand public, qui a également fait l’objet d’une élaboration conceptuelle majeure dans le domaine scientifique. À ce titre, il nous semble que le concept d’optimisme soit particulièrement utile et pertinent pour comprendre les conduites de nos concitoyens et son influence possible dans la période de confinement qui s’impose actuellement à tous, de la même manière qu’il est nécessaire de penser l’« après » et ses conséquences à court, moyen et long terme, tant sur le plan économique que sur celui de la santé morale et physique de nos concitoyens. Traditionnellement, être optimiste c’est être confiant dans l’issue positive d’un événement, alors qu’à l’inverse, le pessimisme, c’est plutôt s’attendre au pire. L’incertitude que nous imposent ce virus et les situations inédites qui en découlent nous contraint à penser le monde de demain en des termes nouveaux, ce qui peut être déstabilisant. Comprendre la contribution du concept d’optimisme dans la potentialisation des processus adaptatifs que chacun de nous pourra ou non mobiliser pour faire face et s’adapter à cette crise sanitaire inédite et sans précédent est essentiel. Cela constituera sans doute un défi majeur pour les sciences sociales et la psychologie. C’est la raison pour laquelle nous pensons que le concept d’optimisme peut contribuer à apporter des éléments d’éclairage complémentaires qui nous permettront de mieux saisir les conduites rationnelles (ou non) auxquelles nous pourrions être confrontés dans l’avenir, et dans lesquelles nous sommes déjà impliqués. This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004,2020-09-01,,,
2883,Adipocytokines: Are they the Theory of Everything?,"Introduction Adipose tissue secretes various bioactive peptides/proteins, immune molecules and inflammatory mediators which are known as adipokines or adipocytokines. Adipokines play important roles in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, appetite, glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, angiogenesis, immunity and inflammation. Enormous number of studies from all over the world proved that adipocytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases affecting nearly all body systems, which raises the question whether we can always blame adipocytokines as the triggering factor of every disease that may hit the body. Objective Our review targeted the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems including diabetes mellitus, kidney diseases, gynecological diseases, rheumatologic disorders, cancers, Alzheimer’s, depression, muscle disorders, liver diseases, cardiovascular and lung diseases. Methodology We cited more than 33 recent literature reviews that discussed the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems. Conclusion More evidence is being discovered to date about the role played by adipocytokines in more diseases and extra research is needed to explore hidden roles played by adipokine imbalance on disease pathogenesis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155144,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155144,Scopus,10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155144,2020-09-01,,,

2885,Prevalence and correlates of PTSD and depressive symptoms one month after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in a sample of home-quarantined Chinese university students,"Background When COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019, most citizens were home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus. This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors. Method The PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected. Results The PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%. Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4th year) and living in severely afflicted areas. Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. Conclusions The results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious. Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority focus.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.009,2020-09-01,,,

2894,Psychosocial impact of COVID-19,"Background Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as “coronaphobia”, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. Methods Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Psychology”, “Psychosocial”, “Psychitry”, “marginalized”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic”, “social media” and” “internet”. Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. Results Disease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an “infodemic” spread via different platforms of social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children’s usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. Conclusion For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated. Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.035,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.035,Scopus,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.035,2020-09-01,,,

L’expérience carcérale conforte les détenues-danseuses dans les processus de conscience sensorielle et identitaire, d’estime de soi, de réintégration sociale. Les répercussions touchant les corps et les âmes renvoient aussi à une réflexion –en miroir– sur l’actualité anxiogène et contraignante du confinement : cohabitation dans le respect d’autrui ou insupportable (surnombre, conflit, violence conjugale…), détresse des personnes vulnérables ou isolées en EHPAD malgré des aménagements soignant… en insistant sur les ressources psychocorporelles positives, vitalisantes, propices à de bienfaisantes « évasions ». Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are compared to the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence/her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women start with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, lead by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women's physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population –youth to elderly– try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems.

2902,The proteasome as a druggable target with multiple therapeutic potentialities: Cutting and non-cutting edges,"Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is an adaptable and finely tuned system that sustains proteostasis network under a large variety of physiopathological conditions. Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107579,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107579,Scopus,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107579,2020-09-01,,,
2903,Psychological impact of healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic: A multi-center cross-sectional survey investigation,"Background Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. Results We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. Conclusions The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression.

2928,Predicting adaptive and maladaptive responses to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A prospective longitudinal study,"Background/Objective The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lack of vaccine made extraordinary actions such as social distancing necessary. While some individuals experience the restrictions on daily life as a heavy burden, others adapt to the situation and try to make the best of it. The present longitudinal study investigated the extent and predictors of the burden induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. Method Data were assessed in October 2019 using the DASS-21 and the PMH-Scale, and in March 2020 adding a six-item measure of burden and a 2-item rating of sense of control. Results In a sample of 436 participants, about 28% stayed in self-quarantine, 22 persons had relevant symptoms and one person was positively tested for COVID-19. Most participants experienced medium to high levels of burden but tried to make the best of it. Stress symptoms in 2019 predicted a higher level of burden and PMH predicted a lower level of burden in March 2020. Remarkably, depression and anxiety symptoms did not significantly predict burden. The protective effect of PMH and the negative impact of stress symptoms were mediated by perceived sense of control. Conclusions The results emphasize the protective effect of PMH in extraordinary situations such as the current outbreak of COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.06.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.06.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.06.002,2020-09-01,,,

2934,Psychological states of Bangladeshi people four months after the COVID-19 pandemic: An online survey,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic essentially imposes psychological effects on people. As the pandemic progresses, people experience psychological trauma gradually, which can change over time. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among Bangladeshi people four months after the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among Bangladeshi citizens aged ≥18 years from June 1 to June 10, 2020. The participants completed an online questionnaire examining socio-demographic variables and COVID-19 related factors, along with the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21. A total of 1146 respondents have been included in the study. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, IBM Statistics version 22.0. Results The prevalence of moderate to the extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress was 47.2%, 46.0%, and 32.5%, respectively, with no significant gender differences. The prevalence of anxiety and stress was significantly higher in participants aged >30 than in participants aged 18–30 years. Daily follow up COVID-19 related news, having COVID-19 symptoms so far, having contact (direct or indirect) with COVID-19 infected person, and fear of infection were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusions Sizable proportions of participants had depression, anxiety and stress four months after the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. The findings of this study underscores the need for strategies aimed at reducing these psychological sufferings in Bangladeshi people in the context of COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05057,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05057,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05057,2020-09-01,,,

A total of 232 students provided complete information regarding the survey. The simple percentage distribution was used to assess the learning status of the study participants. During the lockdown period, around 70% of learners were involved in e-learning. Most of the learners were used android mobile for attending e-learning. Students have been facing various problems related to depression anxiety, poor internet connectivity, and unfavorable study environment at home. Students from remote areas and marginalized sections mainly face enormous challenges for the study during this pandemic. This study suggests targeted interventions to create a positive space for study among students from the vulnerable section of society. Strategies are urgently needed to build a resilient education system in the state that will ensure to develop the skill for employability and the productivity of the young minds.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105194,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105194,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105194,2020-09-01,,,

2968,COVID-19 lockdown in people with severe mental disorders in Spain: Do they have a specific psychological reaction compared with other mental disorders and healthy controls?,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown restrictions could have adverse consequences for patients with severe mental disorders (SMD). Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) on people with SMD (n = 125) compared with two control groups: common mental disorders (CMD, n = 250) and healthy controls (HC, n = 250). An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19–26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the DASS-21 and IES scales. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models. People with SMD had higher anxiety, stress, and depression responses than HC, but lower scores than CMD in all domains. Most people with SMD (87.2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages. After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (OR = 0.721; 95% CI: 0.579–0.898). In the SMD group, higher anxiety was associated with being single (beta = 0.144), having COVID-19 symptoms (beta = 0.146), and a higher score on the stress subscale of DASS-21 (beta = 0.538); whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (beta = −0.244). Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, and suggesting this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.018,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.018,Scopus,10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.018,2020-09-01,,,

2976,An analysis on self-management and treatment-related functionality and characteristics of highly rated anxiety apps,"Background and objective Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. Method A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. Results A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. Conclusions Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104243,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104243,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104243,2020-09-01,,,

2983,Implementing an intensive care unit (ICU) diary program at a large academic medical center: Results from a randomized control trial evaluating psychological morbidity associated with critical illness,"Background Psychological morbidity in both patients and family members related to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience is an often overlooked, and potentially persistent, healthcare problem recognized by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as Post-intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). ICU diaries are an intervention increasingly under study with potential to mitigate ICU-related psychological morbidity, including ICU-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. As we encounter a growing number of ICU survivors, in particular in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians must be equipped to understand the severity and prevalence of significant psychiatric complications of critical illness. Methods We compared the efficacy of the ICU diary, written by family and healthcare workers during the patient's intensive care course, versus education alone in reducing acute PTSD symptoms after discharge. Patients with an ICU stay >72 h, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated over 24 h, were recruited and randomized to either receive a diary at bedside with psychoeducation or psychoeducation alone. Intervention patients received their ICU diary within the first week of admission into the intensive care unit. Psychological symptom screening with IES-R, PHQ-8, HADS and GAD-7 was conducted at baseline within 1 week of ICU discharge and at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after ICU discharge. Change from baseline in these scores was assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results From September 26, 2017 to September 25, 2018, our team screened 265 patients from the surgical and medical ICUs at a single large academic urban hospital. 60 patients were enrolled and randomized, of which 35 patients completed post-discharge follow-up, (n = 18) in the diary intervention group and (n = 17) in the education-only control group. The control group had a significantly greater decrease in PTSD, hyperarousal, and depression symptoms at week 4 compared to the intervention group. There were no significant differences in other measures, or at other follow-up intervals. Both study groups exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms at all timepoints after ICU discharge. Follow-up phone interviews with patients revealed that while many were interested in getting follow-up for their symptoms, there were many barriers to accessing appropriate therapy and clinical attention. Conclusions Results from psychological screening tools demonstrate no benefit of ICU diaries versus bedside education-alone in reducing PTSD symptoms related to the intensive care stay. However, our study finds an important gap in clinical practice – patients at high risk for PICS are infrequently connected to appropriate follow-up care. Perhaps ICU diaries would prove beneficial if utilized to support the work within a program providing wrap-around services and close psychiatric follow up for PICS patients. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ICU-related PTSD in our cohort of survivors, the high barrier to accessing care for appropriate treatment of PICS, and the consequence of that barrier—prolonged psychological morbidity.

2988,Quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak: Changes in diet and physical activity increase the risk of cardiovascular disease,"Aims CoV-19/SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of infection, several governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on lifestyle, including nutrition and physical activity and the impact of new technologies in dealing with this situation. Data synthesis Quarantine is associated with stress and depression leading to unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity. A diet poor in fruit and vegetables is frequent during isolation, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a principal weapon in the fight against the Cov-19 virus. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet should be implemented. The WHO has just released guidance for people in self-quarantine, those without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness, which provides practical advice on how to stay active and reduce sedentary behavior while at home. Conclusion Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to a good lifestyle routine.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020,Scopus,10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020,2020-08-28,,,

3044,Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China,"Background On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Objective This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. Study Design A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Results Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Conclusion Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009,2020-08-01,,,

3057,University students’ mental health amidst the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece,"The COVID-19 hit also Greece but due to early measures and their exceptional success, the death toll is one of the lowest in the world. Here we report the results from the analysis of the responses to an online survey, from the first 1000 university students, concerning the impact of the lockdown on their mental health. Overall, there was a ‘horizontal’ increase in scores; 42.5% for anxiety, 74.3% for depression, and 63.3% increase in total suicidal thoughts. Quantity of sleep increased in 66.3% but quality worsened in 43.0%. Quality of life worsened in 57.0% (same in 27.9%). There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts. Almost a third accept and one fifth are open to conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students. While the acute impact seems clear, the long-term consequences are unknown and although suicidal thoughts have risen substantially, it seems unlikely this will result in deaths. However, the results constitute a clear message that vulnerable populations are at a need for specific interventions concerning their mental health issues.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113111,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113111,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113111,2020-08-01,,,

3066,Comprehensive review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province and has rapidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 01/30/2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on 03/11/2020. The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide crossed the one million mark on 04/02/2020; two million mark on 04/15/2020; three million mark on 04/27/2020 and the four million mark on 05/09/2020. Despite containment efforts, more than 187 countries have been affected with more than 4,178,346 cases in the world with maximum being in USA (1,347,936) followed by 227,436 in Spain and 224,422 in United Kingdom as of May, 2020. COVID-19 is the latest threat to face mankind cutting across geographical barriers in a rapidly changing landscape. This review provides an update on a rapidly evolving global pandemic. As we face the threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, this is a stark reminder to invest in population health, climate change countermeasures, a global health surveillance system and effective research into identifying pathogens, their treatment and prevention and effective health delivery systems.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bj.2020.05.023,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bj.2020.05.023,Scopus,10.1016/j.bj.2020.05.023,2020-08-01,,,

3083,Hypothesized behavioral host manipulation by SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 infection,"Although not widely studied, behavioral host manipulation by various pathogens has been documented. Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (Ro) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host’s central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animal’s saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten. Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive. Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission. Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109750,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109750,Scopus,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109750,2020-08-01,,,

The other case, patient B, is that of an 83-year-old man who was on the unit when patient A tested positive, and brought up concerns for risk of dissemination in the context of wandering, spitting behaviors, and inability to adhere to room isolation or masking measures.

3100,Extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global health threat. Although most patients with COVID-19 manifest fever and respiratory tract symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also involve other organs/systems and present with extra-respiratory manifestations, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, olfactory, gustatory, ocular, cutaneous and haematological symptoms. Occasionally, these extra-respiratory symptoms/signs represent the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior to fever or respiratory manifestations. Therefore, this comprehensive review of the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 is intended to help clinicians better understand the range of clinical presentations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing the consideration of COVID-19 in differential diagnoses. A screening test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed when patients have these extra-respiratory manifestations. In addition, clinicians should be alerted to the adverse effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that can mimic the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Moreover, some extra-respiratory manifestations, such as ocular and gastrointestinal involvement, may be caused by direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, protective measures should be taken while managing the associated clinical specimens. Finally, several extra-respiratory manifestations, such as cardiac involvement, acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders and thrombotic complications, could be associated with a poor prognosis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106024,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106024,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106024,2020-08-01,,,

3105,Unravelling potential severe psychiatric repercussions on healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 crisis,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is putting healthcare professionals, especially those in the frontline, under extreme pressures, with a high risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, psychological disturbances, stigmatization, insomnia, depression and anxiety. We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant somatic or psychiatric history that experienced a “brief reactive psychosis (298.8)” under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes. She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with significant psychopathological improvement being later discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.061,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.061,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.061,2020-08-01,,,

3109,Mental health status of medical staff in emergency departments during the Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in China,"Background The emergency department is considered to be a high-risk area, as it is often the first stop for febrile patients who are subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. This study, which employed a cross-sectional design, aimed to assess the mental health of emergency department medical staff during the epidemic in China. Methods Demographic data and mental health measurements were collected by electronic questionnaires from February 28, 2020 to March 18, 2020. Outcomes A total of 14,825 doctors and nurses in 31 provinces of mainland China completed the survey. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 25.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Men were more likely to have depressive symptoms and PTSD than women. Those who were middle aged, worked for fewer years, had longer daily work time, and had lower levels of social support were at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and PTSD. Working in the Hubei province was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, while those working in the Hubei province but residing in another province had a lower risk of depressive symptoms and PTSD. Being a nurse was associated with a higher risk of PTSD. Interpretation The findings suggest that targeted psychological interventions to promote the mental health of medical staff with psychological problems need to be immediately implemented. Special attention should be paid to local medical staff in Hubei.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.002,2020-08-01,,,

However, the cause of this self-reported depression during the convalescent period remains unclear. Here, we report the mental health status of 96 convalescent COVID-19 patients who were surveyed using an online questionnaire at the Shenzhen Samii Medical Center from March 2 to March 12, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. After obtaining their informed consent, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients, including routine blood and biochemical data. The results suggested that patients with self-reported depression exhibited increased immune response, as indicated by increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. However, the mechanism linking self-reported depression to these cellular changes needs further study. In conclusion, self-reported depression occurred at an early stage in convalescent COVID-19 patients, and changes in immune function were apparent during short-term follow-up of these patients after discharge. Appropriate psychological interventions are necessary, and changes in immune function should be emphasized during long-term follow up of these patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.062,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.062,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.062,2020-08-01,,,

3120,"Cancer, immune suppression and Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19): Need to manage drug safety (French Society for Oncology Pharmacy [SFPO] guidelines)","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is disrupting our health environment. As expected, studies highlighted the great susceptibility of cancer patients to COVID-19 and more severe complications, leading oncologists to deeply rethink patient cancer care. This review is dedicated to the optimization of care pathways and therapeutics in cancer patients during the pandemic and aims to discuss successive issues. First we focused on the international guidelines proposing adjustments and alternative options to cancer care in order to limit hospital admission and cytopenic treatment in cancer patients, most of whom are immunocompromised. In addition cancer patients are prone to polypharmacy, enhancing the risk of drug-related problems as adverse events and drug-drug interactions. Due to increased risk in case of COVID-19, we reported a comprehensive review of all the drug-related problems between COVID-19 and antineoplastics. Moreover, in the absence of approved drug against COVID-19, infected patients may be included in clinical trials evaluating new drugs with a lack of knowledge, particularly in cancer patients. Focusing on the several experimental drugs currently being evaluated, we set up an original data board helping oncologists and pharmacists to identify promptly drug-related problems between antineoplastics and experimental drugs. Finally additional and concrete recommendations are provided, supporting oncologists and pharmacists in their efforts to manage cancer patients and to optimize their treatments in this new era related to COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102063,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102063,Scopus,10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102063,2020-08-01,,,

3129,Subjective neurological symptoms frequently occur in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection,"Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a novel pneumonia leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system. The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Methods We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome “Tor Vergata”, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer. Results We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS. Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression. Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache. Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission. Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization. In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels. These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression. Conclusions Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS. These symptoms are present from the early phases of the disease. The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS. Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.037,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.037,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.037,2020-08-01,,,

Methods The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>6 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, as well as prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. Results A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 ± 3.8 vs 7.5 ± 3.7; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.47), AIS (6.9 ± 4.3 vs 5.3 ± 3.8; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.38), anxiety (4.9 ± 2.7 vs 4.3 ± 2.6; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.22) and depression (4.1 ± 2.5 vs 3.6 ± 2.4; P = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.21), as well as higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQI > 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR] = 1.29; P < 0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RR = 1.45; P < 0.001).

3154,COVID 19–Depression and Neurosurgeons,"Objective The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20. Results A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19–positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28). Conclusions Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007,2020-08-01,,,

We analyzed COVID-19 adult patients in the TriNetX database, which is a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data from a network of health care organizations (HCOs) from January 20, 2020 to June 10th, 2020. 40,469 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 among whom 9086 (22.5%) patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most common neurologic manifestations included headache (3.7%) and sleep disorders (3.4%), Encephalopathy (2.3%), Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1.0%) and 0.6% had seizures. Most common psychiatric manifestations included anxiety and other related disorders (4.6%), mood disorders (3.8%), while 0.2% patients had suicidal ideation. Early recognition and prompt management of neuropsychiatric manifestations in these patients have a potential to decrease overall morbidity and mortality.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.020,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.020,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.020,2020-08-01,,,
3158,"Incremental validity of coronaphobia: Coronavirus anxiety explains depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety","The adverse psychological effects of COVID-19 have increased globally. Moreover, the psychological toll may be worsening for this health crisis due to the growing numbers of mass deaths and unemployment levels. Coronaphobia, a relatively new pandemic-related construct, has been shown to be strongly related to functional impairment and psychological distress. However, the extent to which coronaphobia is uniquely accountable for the psychological distress experienced during the COVID-19 crisis has not been systematically investigated. The current study examined this question of incremental validity using online data from 453 adult MTurk workers in the U.S. The results of a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that coronaphobia explained additional variance in depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety, above sociodemographics, COVID-19 factors, and the vulnerability factors of neuroticism, health anxiety, and reassurance-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that health professionals should be aware of coronaphobia as this expression of pandemic-related stress has reliably demonstrated incremental validity in accounting for major indicators of psychological distress.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102268,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102268,Scopus,10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102268,2020-08-01,,,
3159,"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. Methods A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Findings Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33,062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38·9% across 5 studies. Interpretation Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.026,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.026,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.026,2020-08-01,,,

3162,Projected increases in suicide in Canada as a consequence of COVID-19,"Macroeconomic indicators, notably unemployment, are significant moderators of suicide. We projected the number of excess suicides in Canada as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment. Annual suicide mortality (2000-2018) and unemployment (2000-2019) data were derived from Statistics Canada. Time-trend regression models were used to evaluate and predict the number of excess suicides in 2020 and 2021 for two possible projection scenarios following the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) an increase in unemployment of 1.6% in 2020, 1.2% in 2021, or 2) an increase in unemployment of 10.7% in 2020, 8.9% in 2021. A percentage point increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.0% increase in suicide between 2000 and 2018. In the first scenario, the rise in unemployment rates resulted in a projected total of 418 excess suicides in 2020-2021 (suicide rate per 100,000: 11.6 in 2020). In the second scenario, the projected suicide rates per 100,000 increased to 14.0 in 2020 and 13.6 in 2021, resulting in 2114 excess suicides in 2020-2021. These results indicate that suicide prevention in the context of COVID-19-related unemployment is a critical priority. Furthermore, timely access to mental healthcare, financial provisions and social/labour support programs, as well as optimal treatment for mental disorders is urgently needed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113104,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113104,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113104,2020-08-01,,,

The emotional impact of the situation was analyzed using the Impact of Event Scale. An online survey was fulfilled by 2530 members of the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Moderate to extremely severe scores of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported by 21.34%, 34.19% and 28.14% of the respondents, respectively. A total of 50.43% of respondents presented moderate to severe impact of the outbreak. Students from Arts & Humanities and Social Sciences & Law showed higher scores related to anxiety, depression, stress and impact of event with respect to students from Engineering & Architecture. University staff presented lower scores in all measures compared to students, who seem to have suffered an important psychological impact during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown.

This cross-sectional online study assessed 898 participants from April 13, 2020 to May 19, 2020, approximately one month after the U.S. declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19 and prior to the initial lifting of restrictions across 50 U.S. states. Respondents reported high levels of depression (43.3%, PHQ-8 scores ≥ 10), high anxiety scores (45.4%, GAD-7 scores ≥ 10), and high levels of PTSD symptoms (31.8%, PCL-C scores ≥ 45). High levels of loneliness, high levels of COVID-19-specific worry, and low distress tolerance were significantly associated with clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Resilience was associated with low levels of depression and anxiety symptoms but not PTSD. Most respondents had high levels of social support; social support from family, but not from partner or peers, was associated with low levels of depression and PTSD. Compared to Whites, Asian Americans were less likely to report high levels across mental health symptoms, and Hispanic/Latinos were less likely to report high levels of anxiety.

Methods An online survey is conducted to asses psychological responses of healthcare workers and related factors during Covid-19 outbreak. It is consisted of three subsections covering the following areas: 1) sociodemographic data 2) information on individuals` working condition 3) Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DAS-21). Results Of all 442 participants, 286 (64.7%) had symptoms of depression, 224 (51.6%) anxiety, and 182 (41.2%) stress. Being female, young, and single, having less work experience, working in frontline were associated with higher scores, whereas having a child was associated with lower scores in each subscale. Factors found to be associated with higher DAS-21 total scores in frontline workers were as follows: increased weekly working hours, increased number of Covid-19 patients cared for, lower level of support from peers and supervisors, lower logistic support, and lower feelings of competence during Covid-19 related tasks.

3172,COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study examined the psychological impact of media use among people indirectly exposed to the disease during the initial phase of the outbreak. We conducted an internet-based survey on January 28, 2020 (one week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Media use (media forms, content of media exposure, and media engagement) related to the outbreak and psychological outcomes (positive and negative affect, anxiety, depression, and stress) of 917 Chinese adults was assessed. A series of multivariable regressions were conducted. The results showed that use of new media, rather than traditional media, was significantly associated with more negative affect, depression, anxiety, and stress. Viewing stressful content (i.e., severity of the outbreak, reports from hospital) was associated with more negative affect and depression. Media engagement was also associated with more negative affect, anxiety, and stress. However, viewing heroic acts, speeches from experts, and knowledge of the disease and prevention were associated with more positive affect and less depression. The study suggested new media use and more media engagement was associated with negative psychological outcomes, while certain media content was associated with positive psychological impact. The present study highlights the need for timely public health communication from official sources and suggests that reduced exposure to new media may be beneficial.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102248,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102248,Scopus,10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102248,2020-08-01,,,

Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump). The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC =0.88), while the original cut score of ≥9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores.

3181,Impact of Covid-19 lockdown on characteristics of autopsy cases in Greece. Comparison between 2019 and 2020,"In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2m distance), or even generalized lockdown. Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70–79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110365,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110365,Scopus,10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110365,2020-08-01,,,

3183,Filtration performances of non-medical materials as candidates for manufacturing facemasks and respirators,"The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is causing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in different countries around the world. Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols, facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification, are urgently needed. Given the situation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that “in settings where facemasks are not available, healthcare personnel might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for the care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.” Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail. Moreover, there are a series of non-medical materials available on the market, such as household air filters, coffee filters, and different types of fabrics, which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials. The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size-dependent filtration performances. The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials. The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance. Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes, it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113582,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113582,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113582,2020-08-01,,,

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. Methods The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score ≥ 55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention.

At baseline, 30% of patients had ST-T abnormalities, and 33% had left ventricular hypertrophy. During hospitalization, 26% of patients developed new ECG abnormalities which included atrial fibrillation, ST-T changes, tachy-brady syndrome, and changes consistent with acute pericarditis. One patient was transferred to intensive care unit for massive pulmonary embolism with right bundle branch block, and another for non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patients free of ECG changes during hospitalization were more likely to be treated with antiretrovirals (68% vs 15%, p = 0.001) and hydroxychloroquine (89% vs 62%, p = 0.026) versus those who developed ECG abnormalities after admission. Most measurable ECG features at discharge did not show significant changes from baseline (all p>0.05) except for a slightly decrease in Cornell voltages (13±6 vs 11±5 mm; p = 0.0001) and a modest increase in the PR interval. The majority (54%) of patients with ECG abnormalities had 2 prior consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs. ECG abnormalities were first detected after an average of about 30 days from symptoms’ onset (range 12–51 days). Conclusions . ECG abnormalities during hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia reflect a wide spectrum of cardiovascular complications, exhibit a late onset, do not progress in parallel with pulmonary abnormalities and may occur after negative nasopharyngeal swabs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.06.015,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.06.015,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejim.2020.06.015,2020-08-01,,,

3194,Immediate psychological distress in quarantined patients with COVID-19 and its association with peripheral inflammation: A mixed-method study,"Since the end of 2019, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the cause of a worldwide pandemic. The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within ± three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of “Perceived Helplessness”, the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman’s correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.038,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.038,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.038,2020-08-01,,,

3196,Safety issues and harmful pharmacological interactions of nutritional supplements in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: considerations for Standard of Care and emerging virus outbreaks,"At the moment, little treatment options are available for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to a complex cascade of pathogenic events in myofibres, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress as well as altered metabolism. The attention towards dietary supplements in DMD is rapidly increasing, with the aim to counteract pathology-related alteration in nutrient intake, the consequences of catabolic distress or to enhance the immunological response of patients as nowadays for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. By definition, supplements do not exert therapeutic actions, although a great confusion may arise in daily life by the improper distinction between supplements and therapeutic compounds. For most supplements, little research has been done and little evidence is available concerning their effects in DMD as well as their preventing actions against infections. Often these are not prescribed by clinicians and patients/caregivers do not discuss the use with their clinical team. Then, little is known about the real extent of supplement use in DMD patients. It is mistakenly assumed that, since compounds are of natural origin, if a supplement is not effective, it will also do no harm. However, supplements can have serious side effects and also have harmful interactions, in terms of reducing efficacy or leading to toxicity, with other therapies. It is therefore pivotal to shed light on this unclear scenario for the sake of patients. This review discusses the supplements mostly used by DMD patients, focusing on their potential toxicity, due to a variety of mechanisms including pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions and contaminations, as well as on reports of adverse events. This overview underlines the need for caution in uncontrolled use of dietary supplements in fragile populations such as DMD patients. A culture of appropriate use has to be implemented between clinicians and patients’ groups.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104917,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104917,Scopus,10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104917,2020-08-01,,,
3197,"A multinational, multicentre study on the psychological outcomes and associated physical symptoms amongst healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak","Objective Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54–5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36–3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27–7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12–4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049,2020-08-01,,,

3214,Adolescents' Motivations to Engage in Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Mental and Social Health,"Purpose Reducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance. Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Methods Data were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Results Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Conclusions Understanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.05.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.05.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.05.004,2020-08-01,,,

3298,Provision of Emergency Maxillofacial Service During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Collaborative Five Centre UK Study,"The global pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents one of the greatest challenges to healthcare systems, and has forced medical specialties to rapidly adapt their approaches to patient care. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is considered particularly at risk of disease transmission due to aerosol generation during surgical interventions, patient proximity and operating environment. On day 2 (26th March, 2020) of when severe restrictions in population movement were instigated in the United Kingdom, we began a study to prospectively monitor the presentation and management of maxillofacial emergencies at five hospital trusts. Data was collected onto an online live database fed through a smartphone application. Of the total 529 patients over six weeks, 395 attended for face-to-face consultations and 134 patients received remote consultations via telephone or video link. There were 255 trauma related cases, 221 infection and 48 cases of postoperative complications. Most trauma cases were minor soft tissue injury related to slip, trip or fall at home. There were 44 cases of facial fractures with a tendency for conservative treatment. 19 cases were related to domestic violence or self-harm. Of the 216 dental related emergencies, 68% could have been managed in the primary care setting. A quarter of all emergency patients were satisfactorily managed by remote consultations. There was a significant change in the provision of emergency maxillofacial service during the pandemic lockdown. We discuss the study findings as well as the potential implications in relation to planning for possible further COVID- 19 spikes and future pandemics.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.05.020,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.05.020,Scopus,10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.05.020,2020-07-01,,,

Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider psychological resilience but also to enhance psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.025,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.025,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.025,2020-07-01,,,

3336,Impact on mental health and perceptions of psychological care among medical and nursing staff in Wuhan during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease outbreak: A cross-sectional study,"The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help. However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028,2020-07-01,,,

3344,Overdose and risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019,"Background There have been significant efforts to respond to the two public health emergencies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and overdose in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19 for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose during 2015–2017 in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. Methods Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort which includes a 20 % random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015 to December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. Results Persons who had a non-fatal overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. Conclusion Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19.

3397,Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals’ lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027,2020-07-01,,,

Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113100,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113100,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113100,2020-07-01,,,

3408,Nowhere to hide: The significant impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures on elite and semi-elite South African athletes,"Objectives To describe the perceptions of South African elite and semi-elite athletes on return to sport (RTS); maintenance of physical conditioning and other activities; sleep; nutrition; mental health; healthcare access; and knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design Cross- sectional study. Methods A Google Forms survey was distributed to athletes from 15 sports in the final phase (last week of April 2020) of the level 5 lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe player demographic data. Chi-squared tests investigated significance (p <0.05) between observed and expected values and explored sex differences. Post hoc tests with a Bonferroni adjustment were included where applicable. Results 67% of the 692 respondents were males. The majority (56%) expected RTS after 1–6 months. Most athletes trained alone (61%; p <0.0001), daily (61%; p <0.0001) at moderate intensity (58%; p <0.0001) and for 30–60min (72%). During leisure time athletes preferred sedentary above active behaviour (p <0.0001). Sleep patterns changed significantly (79%; p <0.0001). A significant number of athletes consumed excessive amounts of carbohydrates (76%; p <0.0001; males 73%; females 80%). Many athletes felt depressed (52%), and required motivation to keep active (55%). Most had access to healthcare during lockdown (80%) and knew proceedings when suspecting COVID-19 (92%). Conclusions COVID-19 had physical, nutritional and psychological consequences that may impact on the safe RTS and general health of athletes. Lost opportunities and uncertain financial and sporting futures may have significant effects on athletes and the sports industry. Government and sporting federations must support athletes and develop and implement guidelines to reduce the risk in a COVID-19 environment.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2020.05.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2020.05.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsams.2020.05.016,2020-07-01,,,

3413,Mental Health and Psychosocial Challenges in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Food for Thought for Cardiovascular Health Care Professionals,"Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management. Purpose This commentary aims to summarise some of the potential mental health and psychosocial challenges that may arise in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.05.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.05.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.hlc.2020.05.002,2020-07-01,,,

In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an “immune booster”, are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the “meaning response” described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance.

Research of insomnia during a pandemic crisis is limited. The aim of the present study was to explore sleep difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Greek population. The three-day online survey included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, contact with COVID-19 and COVID-19-related negative attitudes, as well as the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance to Uncertainty scale (IUS), the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale (JGLS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) Depression Scale. Altogether, 2,427 individuals participated in the study (with 2,363 of them providing all basic demographic data). Sleep problems were detected in 37.6% of the participants. Women and people in urban areas were more vulnerable to sleep problems, while younger age showed a non-significant trend. Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores. Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia. Results may be used for the development of therapeutic strategies and implementation of social policies to support people with sleep difficulties.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113076,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113076,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113076,2020-07-01,,,
3444,A longitudinal study on the mental health of general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China,"In addition to being a public physical health emergency, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected global mental health, as evidenced by panic-buying worldwide as cases soared. Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 s-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p > 0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID-19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028,2020-07-01,,,

Although vital, these interventions may be socially and economically disruptive, contributing to adverse psychological outcomes. This study examined relations of both stay-at-home orders and the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life to psychological outcomes (depression, health anxiety, financial worry, social support, and loneliness) in a nationwide U.S. community adult sample (N = 500; 47% women, mean age = 40). Participants completed questionnaires assessing psychological outcomes, stay-at-home order status, and COVID-19’s impact on their daily life. Being under a stay-at-home order was associated with greater health anxiety, financial worry, and loneliness. Moreover, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life was positively associated with health anxiety, financial worry, and social support, but negatively associated with loneliness. Findings highlight the importance of social connection to mitigate negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113098,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113098,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113098,2020-07-01,,,

3447,Do psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown? A case-control study with service and research implications for immunopsychiatry,"This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures.

3451,At the height of the storm: Healthcare staff's health conditions and job satisfaction and their associated predictors during the epidemic peak of COVID-19,"This study reports the physical health, mental health, anxiety, depression, distress, and job satisfaction of healthcare staff in Iran when the country faced its highest number of total active COVID-19 cases. In a sample of 304 healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians, etc.), we found a sizable portion reached the cutoff levels of disorders in anxiety (28.0%), depression (30.6%), and distress (20.1%). Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction. The healthcare workers varied greatly in their access to PPE and in their status of COVID-19 infection: negative (69.7%), unsure (28.0%), and positive (2.3%). The predictors were also different from those identified in previous studies of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 crisis in China.

3459,"Frontline nurses’ burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear statuses and their associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China: A large-scale cross-sectional study","Background During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline nurses face enormous mental health challenges. Epidemiological data on the mental health statuses of frontline nurses are still limited. The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Methods A large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used. A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study. Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020. Findings On average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear. About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (n = 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (n = 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (n = 1,219, 60.6%). The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively. The majority of the nurses (n = 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness. Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness. Interpretation The frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers. Future interventions at the national and organisational levels are needed to improve mental health during this pandemic by preventing and managing skin lesions, building self-efficacy and resilience, providing sufficient social support, and ensuring frontline work willingness.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100424,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100424,Scopus,10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100424,2020-07-01,,,

3475,Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Consensus guidance,"As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced steps such as spatial distancing and “staying at home” to curb its spread and impact. The fear resulting from the disease, the ‘lockdown’ situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns. The present consensus guidance discusses these risks and makes some practical recommendations that may help diminish them.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152180,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152180,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152180,2020-07-01,,,

An estimated 798,365 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander were in Australia, 5,2 million indigenous people living in America and 2,13 million in Canada. Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service use have increased especially in the context of the new coronavirus pandemic. Thus, we aimed to describe the mental health situation of the indigenous population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic Method : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : According to the literature, due to the COVID-19 pandemic there is a lack of specialized mental health services and professionals, a restricted access to quality information and a lack of access to inputs, causing negative feelings and it can exacerbate pre-existing mental problems (eg: depression, suicidal ideation, smoking and binge drink). The cultural differences are a risk factor to worsen the mental health of this already vulnerable population.

An online-based pilot survey was conducted to study how people with diabetes were coping with their Diabetes during the COVID - 19 lockdown. Method The questions were designed in an online survey, Survey Monkey, to conduct this cross-sectional study. The link was generated and sent to 100 registered patients of the MV Hospital for Diabetes Royapuram who had not contacted the hospital after the lockdown announcement. The survey was done between April 1 and April 15, 2020.Oral consent was obtained through telephone before the link was sent by Whatsapp to them.The questionnaire consisted of questions on home blood glucose monitoring, regularity in doing their physical activity and dietary compliance and anxiety about the viral infection. Results 92% of the participants had Type 2 diabetes. Only 28% of the participants were checking their blood glucose levels regularly. 80% of the participants mentioned that they were following regular exercise and diet control during the lockdown period. 40% of the participants were anxious about the Covid infection. Conclusion SMBG needs to be practiced on regular basis, especially among the patients with diabetes on insulin therapy. Most of the people surveyed were coping well with their Diabetes. Patients have reported that they were able to maintain proper dietary compliance and be more physically active at home during this lockdown.

3479,COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers,"Background The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented threats and challenges to health workers (HWs) in Wuhan, China. We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. Findings We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47–0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47–2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27–1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77–6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. Interpretation Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100443,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100443,Scopus,10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100443,2020-07-01,,,

3481,Is returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic stressful? A study on immediate mental health status and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of Chinese workforce,"This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic. Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. >95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p < 0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work. Our findings would provide information for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055,2020-07-01,,,

3483,Addictovigilance contribution during COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown in France,"Addictovigilance is a safety monitoring targeted at substances with potential for abuse and dependence. This vigilance was involved during the period of COVID-19 epidemic due to the significant changes in access to drugs and psychological disruption caused by the pandemic and lockdown. This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role: among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19). COVID-19 epidemic has been an important challenge for addictovigilance, and has proved that this monitoring is highly essential for alerting health professionals and health authorities to points of vigilance in the field of psychoactive substances.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.06.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.06.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.therap.2020.06.006,2020-07-01,,,

3487,"Affective temperament, attachment style, and the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak: an early report on the Italian general population","The outbreak of COVID-19 is severely affecting mental health worldwide, although individual response may vary. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In our sample (n = 500), 62% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4% and 18.6% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; p < 0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; p < 0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; p = 0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ “Need for approval” (OR: 1.08; p = 0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.89; p = 0.002) and “Discomfort with closeness” were protective (OR: 0.92; p = 0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p = 0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p = 0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.92; p = 0.039) and “Discomfort with closeness” (OR: 0.94; p = 0.023) were protective. Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population. Moreover, our study is the first to investigate temperament and attachment characteristics in the psychological response to the ongoing pandemic.

3491,Role of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the function of immune and respiratory systems in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19): A review,"Background and aims COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Methods This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Results This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038,Scopus,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038,2020-07-01,,,
3492,Mental health consequences during the initial stage of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in Spain,"The pandemic caused by Covid-19 has been an unprecedented social and health emergency worldwide. This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.040,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.040,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.040,2020-07-01,,,

3494,COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other countries across the world, the Central and State Governments of India initiated several measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to ‘flatten the curve’. One such measure was a ‘total lockdown’ for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579,2020-07-01,,,

3497,Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with severe coronavirus infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis with comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I 2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. Findings 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12·2 years (SD 4·1) to 68·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9%; 95% CI 20·5–36·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32·6%; 24·7–40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7%; 27·6–44·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34·1%; 26·2–42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9%; 22·5–50·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10·5%; 95% CI 7·5–14·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12·1%; 8·6–16·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12·3%; 7·7–17·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12·8%; 8·7–17·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18·9%; 14·1–24·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19·3%; 15·1–23·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30·4%; 23·9–37·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100·0%; 88·0–100·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32·2% (95% CI 23·7–42·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14·9% (12·1–18·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14·8% (11·1–19·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76·9%; 95% CI 68·1–84·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35·3 months (SD 40·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

3508,"COVID-19: Psychological flexibility, coping, mental health, and wellbeing in the UK during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the daily lives of many people across the globe, both through the direct interpersonal cost of the disease, and the governmental restrictions imposed to mitigate its spread and impact. The UK has been particularly affected and has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe. In this paper, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and well-being in the UK during a period of ‘lockdown’ (15th–21st May 2020) and the specific role of Psychological Flexibility as a potential mitigating process. We observed clinically high levels of distress in our sample (N = 555). However, psychological flexibility was significantly and positively associated with greater wellbeing, and inversely related to anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-related distress. Avoidant coping behaviour was positively associated with all indices of distress and negatively associated with wellbeing, while engagement in approach coping only demonstrated weaker associations with outcomes of interest. No relationship between adherence to government guidelines and psychological flexibility was found. In planned regression models, psychological flexibility demonstrated incremental predictive validity for all distress and wellbeing outcomes (over and above both demographic characteristics and COVID-19-specific coping responses). Furthermore, psychological flexibility and COVID-19 outcomes were only part-mediated by coping responses to COVID-19, supporting the position that psychological flexibility can be understood as an overarching response style that is distinct from established conceptualisations of coping. We conclude that psychological flexibility represents a promising candidate process for understanding and predicting how an individual may be affected by, and cope with, both the acute and longer-term challenges of the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.010,2020-07-01,,,
3509,The moderating roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Italy,"The Moderating Roles of Psychological Flexibility and Inflexibility on the Mental Health Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown in Italy. Preliminary data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on mental health in approximately a quarter of the general population. Few prior studies have identified contextual risk factors and no published study has explored factors that might moderate their adverse effects on mental health. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. This study investigated the roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility in moderating the effects of COVID-19 risk factors on three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, depression. We hypothesized that psychological flexibility would mitigate and psychological inflexibility would exacerbate the adverse effects of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. During the Italian national lockdown (M = 39.29 days, SD = 11.26), 1035 adults (79% female, M = 37.5 years, SD = 12.3) completed an online survey. Twelve COVID-19 risk factors were identified (e.g. lockdown duration, family infected by COVID-19, increase in domestic violence and in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours) and constituted a COVID-19 Lockdown Index. As predicted, results showed that after controlling for sociodemographic variables, global psychological flexibility and four of its sub-processes (self-as context, defusion, values, committed action), mitigated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. In contrast and as expected, global psychological inflexibility and four of its sub-processes (lack of contact with present moment, fusion, self-as-content, lack of contact with personal values) exacerbated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. Findings converge with those from the broader psychological flexibility literature providing robust support for the use of ACT-based interventions to promote psychological flexibility and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.003,2020-07-01,,,

Suicide completions are the extreme consequences of COVID-19 related psychological burdens, which was reported in many countries including Bangladesh. However, there are lack of study assessing COVID-19 related human stress and its’ associations with other relevant factors affecting quality of life in the country, and which were explored in the present study. Methods An online based survey was carried out among 340 Bangladeshi adult populations (65.90% male; mean age 26.23 ± 6.39) by utilizing the socio-demographics, possible human stress due to COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Dataset were analysed through a set of statistical tools e.g., T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). Results About 85.60% of the participants are in COVID-19-related stress, which results in sleep shortness, short temper, and chaos in family. Fear of COVID-19 infection (i.e., self and/or family member(s), and/or relatives), hampering scheduled study plan and future career, and financial difficulties are identified as the main causes of human stress. Results of PCM explain the relationship among the factors of human stress, and found economic hardship and food crisis are linked together causes stress of mass people, while hamper of formal education and future plan create stress of career seeker. T-test, and one-way ANOVA illustrate demographic characteristics (i.e., occupation, age, gender, and marital status) have significant effects on elevated mental stress. Moreover, PCA and CA results revealed significant interface among the respondents’ perception and factors of human stress, which matched with the existing scenario of the country.

En este sentido, el objetivo del estudio fue traducir y validar la Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) al español. Material y método Los participantes fueron 704 estudiantes universitarios de ciencias de la salud (Medad = 23.39 años, DE = 3.45) a quienes se les administró el CAS en español, el Mental Health Inventory-5 y el Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item. El CAS se tradujo al español mediante el método hacia adelante y hacia atrás. Se examinaron la fiabilidad y las evidencias de validez basada en la estructura interna y relación con otras variables. Resultados El análisis factorial confirmó la estructura factorial unidimensional del CAS (χ2 = 7.62, gl = 5, p = .18, χ2/df = 1.52, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .03 [CI90% .00, .06]; SRMR = .02, WRMR = .52); además las cargas factoriales fueron grandes y significativas (de .68 a .87). Los cinco ítems del CAS mostraron correlaciones ítems test total corregido aceptables (de .64 a .74). La confiabilidad por consistencia interna fue buena (ω = .89; αordinal = .89). La evidencia de validez con base en la relación con otras variables del CAS fue respaldada por la correlación positiva con la depresión (r = .52, p < .01) y negativa con el bienestar subjetivo (r = -.50, p < .01). Además, la depresión media la relación entre la ansiedad por la COVID-19 y el bienestar subjetivo (valor bootstrap = - .24, IC 95% = - .28, - .20). Conclusión La versión en español del CAS posee evidencias de validez y confiabilidad para medir la ansiedad por la COVID-19 en una muestra de universitarios peruanos. Introduction and objectives COVID-19 has generated negative consequences for people's mental health. This is the case of Peru, one of the Latin American countries most affected by the pandemic. In this sense, the objective of the study was to translate and validate the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) into Spanish. Material and method The participants were 704 university students of health sciences (Mage = 23.39 years, SD = 3.45) who were administered the CAS in Spanish, the Mental Health Inventory-5 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item. The CAS was translated into Spanish using the forward and backward method. Reliability and evidence of validity based on internal structure and relationship with other variables were examined. Results The factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional factor structure of the CAS (χ 2 = 7.62, df = 5, p = .18, χ 2 / gl = 1.52, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .03 [90% CI .00, .06]; SRMR = .02, WRMR = .52); In addition, the factor loadings were large and significant (from .68 to .87). The five CAS items showed acceptable corrected total test item correlations (from .64 to .74). Reliability due to internal consistency was good (ω = .89; αordinal = .89). The validity evidence based on the relationship with other CAS variables was supported by the positive correlation with depression (r = .52, p < .01) and negative with subjective well-being (r = -.50, p < . 01). Furthermore, depression mediates the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and subjective well-being (bootstrap value = - .24, 95% CI = - .28, - .20). Conclusion The Spanish version of the CAS has evidence of validity and reliability to measure anxiety by COVID-19 in a sample of Peruvian university students.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anyes.2020.08.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anyes.2020.08.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.anyes.2020.08.001,2020-07-01,,,

3526,Navigating crisis from the backseat? How top managers can support radical change initiatives by middle managers,"We advance the premise that to navigate crisis, rather than reactively cutting costs by culling middle management, top managers can benefit from enabling radical change initiatives by middle managers. Contextualizing this idea to the marketing function and the COVID-19 crisis, we ask: How can Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) support marketing middle managers (MMMs) in initiating radical change in crisis situations? We take the position that marketing managers' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new-to-the-firm. We then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about ‘who does what’ in radical change initiatives from the marketing function, focusing on the underemphasized possibility of MMMs initiating change and CMOs implementing. Building on recent findings on ‘change role reversal’, we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate, while top managers implement. This unconventional change route would see CMOs taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis, while MMMs take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives. We identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal— approach faced by MMMs throughout three stages of innovation-enabled radical change proposed by Burgelman (1991; variation-selection-retention) and chart corresponding roles that CMOs can play to support MMMs: advisor, judge, and guardian. Three tangible final questions addressed to CMOs guide managerial applications, while considerations outside scope are also discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.024,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.024,Scopus,10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.024,2020-07-01,,,

3573,Suicidal behavior in light of COVID-19 outbreak: Clinical challenges and treatment perspectives,"Objectifs La pandémie de COVID-19 touche à ce jour plus de 3 000 000 de personnes à travers le monde et les mesures de prévention ont conduit au confinement de plus de la moitié de l’humanité. La communauté scientifique et les autorités politiques redoutent une épidémie de suicides secondaires à cette crise. L’objectif de cette revue de la littérature est d’analyser l’impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur les dimensions du processus suicidaire, son interaction avec les différents facteurs de risque. Nous proposons également des solutions innovantes pour y remédier. Méthodes Nous avons réalisé une revue narrative des articles internationaux traitant des grandes pandémies (COVID-19, SRAS) et de leur influence sur la vulnérabilité suicidaire. Résultats De nombreux facteurs sont susceptibles de majorer l’émergence d’idées de suicide et le passage à l’acte suicidaire au cours de cette crise. La distanciation et le confinement pourraient favoriser un sentiment de déconnexion et la perception d’une douleur sociale chez les individus vulnérables. Certaines populations déjà « à risque suicidaire élevé » pourraient être encore fragilisées par la pandémie actuelle : personnes âgées, personnel médical et individus exposés à une forte précarité économique. Plusieurs solutions innovantes adaptées aux contraintes de la distanciation et du confinement permettront de prévenir le risque suicidaire : outils de santé connectée, protocole VigilanS, thérapie comportementale et cognitive de troisième vague et pratique artistique. Conclusions Il est possible que cette crise inédite exacerbe certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire. Cependant, à l’heure de l’innovation, plusieurs outils de prévention du suicide ont toute leur place dans les nouveaux modes de soins et devront être expérimentés à grande échelle. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001,2020-06-01,,,

One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. Materials and methods This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Results Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. Conclusion Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119,2020-06-01,,,

3604,A qualitative study on the psychological experience of caregivers of COVID-19 patients,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly, bringing pressure and challenges to nursing staff. Objective To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Methods Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. Results The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes. First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. Conclusions During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018,2020-06-01,,,

3607,Psychopathological consequences of confinement,"Les effets psychologiques de l’isolement ont déjà été décrits dans la littérature (expéditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). Néanmoins, l’échelle du confinement mis en œuvre à l’occasion de la pandémie à COVID-19 est inédite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les études publiées, mais aussi anticiper les problèmes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou à distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix d’aller au-delà de la littérature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des conséquences connues du confinement : l’ennui, l’isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. L’anxiété, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dépression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets décrits du confinement, mais les mécanismes d’émergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent à étudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mécanismes d’émergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance à garder sur des conséquences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorées dans la littérature sur le confinement, alors qu’une vaste littérature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de conséquences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir à la recherche des différents symptômes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous résumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thérapeutiques déjà mises en place, comme la télémédecine, qui connaît un développement rapide à l’occasion de la crise du COVID-19. The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,2020-06-01,,,

3636,Clinician Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Extraordinary Times and Unusual Challenges for the Allergist/Immunologist,"The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused sudden and dramatic societal changes. The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality, and clinician well-being may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical, and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook. Historical parallels demonstrate that perseverance is as inevitable as pandemics and that we need not navigate this unprecedented time alone.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001,2020-06-01,,,

3643,Health-Related Quality of Life in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Italian Patients Switched to Remote Assistance During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background A rapidly expanding pandemic of the new coronavirus has become the focus of global scientific attention. Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on health-related quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). Objective To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. Results Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. Conclusions The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs. The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQOL.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.003,2020-06-01,,,

3662,"Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey","China has been severely affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) since December, 2019. We aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese public during the outbreak, and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Younger people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (≥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak.

3674,People experiencing homelessness: Their potential exposure to COVID-19,"Background Insufficient housing quality is associated with stress and mental health impacts. Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945,2020-06-01,,,

A total of 2299 eligible participants were enrolled from the authors’ institution, including 2042 medical staff and 257 administrative staff. The severity of fear, anxiety and depression were significantly different between two groups. Furthermore, as compared to the non-clinical staff, front line medical staff with close contact with infected patients, including working in the departments of respiratory, emergency, infectious disease, and ICU, showed higher scores on fear scale, HAMA and HAMD, and they were 1.4 times more likely to feel fear, twice more likely to suffer anxiety and depression.

3684,Health professionals facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: What are the mental health risks?,"Objectifs La pandémie de la maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19) a provoqué une crise sanitaire majeure et mis en quarantaine la moitié de la population planétaire. En France, elle a provoqué une réorganisation en urgence de l’offre de soins mobilisant les soignants dans un climat d’incertitude. L’objectif du présent article est de faire le point sur les risques associés à l’exposition des soignants au COVID-19 pour leur santé mentale. Méthodes Les auteurs ont conduit une revue de la littérature internationale tenant compte des données des précédentes épidémies (SARS-CoV-1, H1N1) et des données plus récentes concernant le COVID-19. Résultats Les caractéristiques de cette pandémie (rapidité de diffusion, connaissances incertaines, sévérité, décès de soignants) ont installé un climat anxiogène. Des facteurs organisationnels peuvent être source de stress : déficit d’équipement de protection individuel, réaffectation de postes, manque de communication, manque de matériels de soins, bouleversement de la vie quotidienne familiale et sociale. D’autres facteurs de risque sont identifiés comme l’absence de soutien, la crainte de contaminer un proche, l’isolement ou la stigmatisation sociale, le haut niveau de stress au travail ou les patterns d’attachement insécure. Les soignants ont ainsi un risque augmenté d’anxiété, de dépression, d’épuisement, d’addiction et de trouble de stress post-traumatique. Conclusions Cette crise sanitaire devrait nous aider à mieux comprendre la vulnérabilité des soignants à la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratégies de prévention primaire et la formation aux enjeux psychologiques des soins, de la relation, et de la gestion des situations de crises sanitaires. Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008,Scopus,10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008,2020-06-01,,,

3691,Impact Of Sars-Cov-2 And Its Reverberation In Global Higher Education And Mental Health,"Background : According to UNESCO's monitoring, more than 160 countries implemented nationwide closures, which impacted over 87% of the world's student population. Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. Method : The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health – these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Conclusions : Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977,2020-06-01,,,

3693,Anxiety regarding contracting COVID-19 related to interoceptive anxiety sensations: The moderating role of disgust propensity and sensitivity,"The COVID-19 public health crisis has led to extensive recommendations by officials to contain its spread. Anxiety regarding contracting the virus is prominent in the public. Specific routes to anxiety over disease contraction are under studied. It is expected that a contributory feature of fear of contracting COVID-19 involve disgust propensity and sensitivity, emotional reactions that are part of a broader behavioral immune system (BIS). A total of N = 908 Chinese adults (mean age = 40.37 years, SD = 9.27; n = 752 female) participated in a survey distributed between February 24 and March 15, 2020. Participants completed measures of anxiety sensitivity, disgust propensity and sensitivity, and fear of contracting COVID-19. Results support a moderating relationship between both disgust propensity and sensitivity in the relationship between physical concerns associated with anxiety sensitivity and fear of contracting COVID-19.

Pour évaluer l’évolution de l’activité des différents centres pratiquant l’ECT, une enquête nationale en ligne a été réalisée. 65 réponses de toute la France ont été analysées. Plus de 90 % des centres pratiquant l’ECT ont connu une diminution de leur activité. Plus inquiétant encore, la moitié des centres ont subi un arrêt total de leur activité et un quart des centres accusent une diminution de plus de la moitié de leur activité habituelle. Les soins psychiatriques post-pandémie COVID-19 s’annoncent difficiles. Il est essentiel de ne pas ajouter à cette difficulté les complications, souvent graves, qui seront liées au retard ou à l’arrêt de la pratique de l’ECT.

Half of the centres experienced a total cessation of activity and 25 % of the centres experienced a decrease of more than half of their usual activity. Post-pandemic COVID-19 psychiatric care is expected to be difficult.

This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health. A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). χ2 test, t test and multiple regression analyses were used in statistical analysis. The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102111,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102111,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102111,2020-06-01,,,

Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102092,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102092,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102092,2020-06-01,,,

3719,When health professionals look death in the eye: the mental health of professionals who deal daily with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak,"Background : The fact that COVID-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger. In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. Method : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. Conclusions : As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic. Intensive care unit physicians are on their stress limit, especially when dealing with older patients and with death prospects.

Refugees have mainly to face their adaption in a host country, which involves bureaucracy, different culture, poverty, and racism. The already fragile situation of refugees becomes worrying and challenged in the face of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees. Method The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID-19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID-19 infection.

3731,Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Objectif En France, les mesures de confinement ont été accompagnées de dispositions spécifiques pour les prisons : suspension des activités, parloirs et interventions extérieures. Plus de dix mille personnes détenues ont en outre été libérées pour diminuer le taux d’occupation des établissements et limiter la propagation du virus. L’objectif de cet article est de décrire la réorganisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire en contexte de pandémie de Covid-19 et d’interroger les conséquences du confinement et des libérations anticipées sur la santé mentale des personnes détenues. Méthode Ce travail s’appuie sur une enquête menée en avril 2020 auprès des soignants de 42 unités sanitaires en milieu pénitentiaire et des 9 unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées en France. Une synthèse de la littérature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire durant l’épidémie de Covid-19 a également été réalisée. Résultats L’épidémie de Covid-19 semble avoir été plutôt contenue dans les prisons françaises au cours de la période de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcérale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire ont instauré des mesures spécifiques pour assurer la continuité des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcérées et contenir l’épidémie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la création de « secteurs Covid », la déprogrammation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures d’hygiène et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontés à des sevrages forcés, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des décompensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libérations anticipées sont aussi très préoccupantes, pouvant entraîner des ruptures de soins, par manque de préparation des relais de prise en charge. Discussion Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilité accrue au fossé qui sépare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pénitentiaire. Il nous apparaît important de rappeler la vulnérabilité des personnes incarcérées qui doivent impérativement être considérées dans les politiques de santé publique. Objective The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees’ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called “UHSAs” (which stands for “unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées”, and can be translated as “specially equipped hospital units”). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of “Covid units”, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives’ well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known “revolving prison doors” effect. Discussion The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002,2020-06-01,,,

L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie Covid-19. Méthode Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité Covid+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Objective The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.

3744,Demographics and self-reported well-being of Brazilian adults as a function of pet ownership: A pilot study,"The goals of the present study were to investigate socio-demographic characteristics and well-being indicators associated with pet ownership. The respondents (N = 801, 53.8% females; 56.2% with children) came from the five macro-regions of Brazil (8% North, 28% Northeast, 36% Southeast, 18% South, 10% Central-West). Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 years. Over half of the sample (60%) reported living with a pet. Logistic regression showed that residence type (to be owner versus renter) and parental status (to be childless versus to have children) were predictors of pet ownership. We found interaction between pet ownership and sex on well-being indicators: the Mann-Whitney test showed that men who owned a pet reported better sleep quality, better relationship with neighbors and less sadness; whereas women who owned a pet reported lower life organization. With respect to life satisfaction, no differences were found between pet owners and non-pet owners. Implications of our findings and new research directions are discussed. Our study was conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey should be reapplied during and after the pandemic, so that we can deepen our knowledge of the socio-demographic characteristics and subjective well-being indicators associated with pet ownership.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04069,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04069,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04069,2020-06-01,,,

3854,Respiratory rehabilitation in elderly patients with COVID-19: A randomized controlled study,"Background Different degrees of disorders are reported in respiratory function, physical function and psychological function in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in elderly patients. With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. Objective To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). Results After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. Conclusions Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166,Scopus,10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166,2020-05-01,,,

3879,Reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: Clinical perspectives from a case series,"Introduction The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. Materials and methods We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del Rocío and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. Results In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. Conclusions We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009,2020-04-01,,,

3975,Utility of Hypertonic Saline and Diazepam in COVID-19–Related Hydroxychloroquine Toxicity,"Background Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) poisoning is a life-threatening but treatable toxic ingestion. The scale of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) and the controversial suggestion that HCQ is a treatment option have led to a significant increase in HCQ use. HCQ poisoning should be at the top-of-mind for emergency providers in cases of toxic ingestion. Treatment for HCQ poisoning includes sodium bicarbonate, epinephrine, and aggressive electrolyte repletion. We highlight the use of hypertonic saline and diazepam. Case Report We describe the case of a 37-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after the ingestion of approximately 16 g of HCQ tablets (initial serum concentration 4270 ng/mL). He was treated with an epinephrine infusion, hypertonic sodium chloride, high-dose diazepam, sodium bicarbonate, and aggressive potassium repletion. Persistent altered mental status necessitated intubation, and he was managed in the medical intensive care unit until his QRS widening and QTc prolongation resolved. After his mental status improved and it was confirmed that his ingestion was not with the intent to self-harm, he was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? For patients presenting with HCQ overdose and an unknown initial serum potassium level, high-dose diazepam and hypertonic sodium chloride should be started immediately for the patient with widened QRS. The choice of hypertonic sodium chloride instead of sodium bicarbonate is to avoid exacerbating underlying hypokalemia which may in turn potentiate unstable dysrhythmia. In addition, early intubation should be a priority in vomiting patients because both HCQ toxicity and high-dose diazepam cause profound sedation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.10.048,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.10.048,Scopus,10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.10.048,2020-01-01,,,

4000,"Depression, Anxiety, and Acute Stress Disorder Among Patients Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Prospective Cohort Study","Background The epidemiology of psychiatric symptoms among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is poorly characterized. Objective This article sought to identify the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and acute stress disorder among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Methods Adult patients recently admitted to nonintensive care unit medical ward settings with coronavirus disease 2019 were eligible for enrollment. Enrolled patients were screened for depression, anxiety, and delirium. Subsequently, patients were followed up by phone after 2 weeks and rescreened for depression, anxiety, and acute stress disorder symptoms. Subjects' medical records were abstracted for clinical data. Results A total of 58 subjects were enrolled; of whom, 44 completed the study. Initially, 36% of subjects had elevated anxiety symptoms and 29% had elevated depression symptoms. At 2-week follow-up, 9% had elevated anxiety symptoms, 20% had elevated depression symptoms, and 25% had mild-to-moderate acute stress disorder symptoms. Discharge to home was not associated with improvement in psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions A significant number of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety. While anxiety improved after index admission, depression remained fairly stable. Furthermore, a significant minority of patients experienced acute stress disorder symptoms, though these were largely mild to moderate.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.10.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.10.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.psym.2020.10.001,2020-01-01,,,

We aimed to investigate the barriers to the physical prevention, negative attitudes, and anxiety levels. Methods A online cross-sectional survey was conducted with the people living in Wuhan between March 12th and 23rd, 2020. Results Of a total of 2411 complete responses, the mean and standard deviation for the total physical prevention barriers score was 19.73 (standard deviation ± 5.3; range 12−45) out of a possible score of 48. Using a cut-off score of 44 for the State-Trait Inventory score, 79.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2−81.5) of the participants reported moderate to severe anxiety during the early phase of the outbreak, and 51.3% (95% CI 49.2−53.3) reported moderate to severe anxiety after the peak of coronavirus diseases 2019 was over (during the study period). Comparing anxiety levels in the early phase of the outbreak and after the peak of the outbreak, 58.5% (95% CI 56.5−60.5) recorded a decreased anxiety. Females reported a higher likelihood of having decreased levels of anxiety than males (odds ratio = 1.78, 95% CI 1.48−2.14). Low negative attitudes score were associated with a higher decrease in anxiety (odds ratio = 1.59, 95% CI 1.33−1.89). Conclusions The attitudinal barriers to prevention of transmission of coronavirus diseases 2019 are more prominent than physical prevention barriers after the peak of coronavirus diseases 2019. High anxiety levels even after the peak warrant serious attention.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.09.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.09.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.psym.2020.09.005,2020-01-01,,,

4076,Survey of prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among 1124 healthcare workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic across India,"Background A prospective study was conducted during the second phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in India to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers (HCWs) and factors that influence the outcome. Methods A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 1124 HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 30, 2020, to April 2, 2020). Demographic data, questions on COVID-19 and scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were analysed using the chi-square test (Bonferroni correction) and binary logistic regression. Results The study consists of 1124 HCWs, including 749 doctors, 207 nurses, 135 paramedics, 23 administrators and ten supporting staff members. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were reported as 37.2% and 31.4%, respectively. The risk factors for anxiety were female gender (30.6% vs 45.5%), age group (20–35 years) (50.4% vs 61.2%), unmarried (21.2% vs 30.6%) and job profile (nurse) (14.7% vs 26.4%). The protective factor was having service of more than 20 years (23.4% vs 14.8%). The risk factors for depression were age group (20-35 years) (51.3% vs 61.3%) and employed at a primary care hospital (16.2% vs 23.4%). The protective factors were job profile (doctor) (69.9% vs 59.6%) and having service of more than 20 years (22.3% vs 15.5%). Conclusion Approximately one-third of the HCWs reported anxiety and depressive symptoms. The risk factors for anxiety symptoms were female gender, younger age and job profile (nurse) and for depressive symptoms were younger age and working at a primary care hospital. Future research studies should identify strategies for providing a safer and supportive work environment for HCWs to face epidemics/pandemics.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.07.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.07.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.07.006,2020-01-01,,,

For example, it is anticipated that individuals living with a major depressive disorder could reach as high as 60% of the population owing to the ongoing disruption from COVID-19. In 2017, the annual rate of individuals experiencing a major depressive episode was only 7.1%.

4096,Minimal Access Gardening: Laparoscopic Techniques during Coronavirus Disease Lockdown,"Objective To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic surgery while all elective procedures are suspended. Design Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques. Setting Gynecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom. Interventions Owing to the coronavirus disease pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom. In addition, there have been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease [1,2]. As a result, laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration, and it is uncertain whether this may have an impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated. Combining gardening, one of the major pastimes during the lockdown period, and minimal access surgical skills, this video demonstrates the different ways minimal access surgery may be applied to horticulture. In the first described technique, what the author believes to be hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) was excised using a grasper and a tripolar cutting device (Fig. 1). For obvious reasons diathermy is not available within the home environment, but the retractable cutting blade was used to efficiently slice through the stems required for weed removal. The disadvantage of this technique is clearly that the unwanted species is likely to regrow in 12 months. In the second described technique, dandelions (genus Taraxacum) (Fig. 2), which are native to Eurasia and North America, were excised at the flowering stage, thereby effectively preventing asexual reproduction by apomixis. The technique similarly uses the retractable blade of the tripolar cutting device. The third technique demonstrates harvesting of an unknown species using a soil dissection technique. To facilitate complete removal of the plant and to reduce the risk of recurrence, the roots are carefully dissected out using blunt dissection. As with many techniques, patience is of paramount importance. Last, ensuring hydration of plants is crucial to their early stage of development. Laparoscopic watering techniques are usually simplified when an irrigation and suction device is employed. However, within a low-resource setting a slow process of “cup feeding” is required and requires meticulous dexterity (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, during this demonstration a common complication of a loss of instrument occurred, but the subject was luckily successfully hydrated. Conclusion While a lockdown remains in place, many gynecologists are not able to maintain their laparoscopic surgical skills. It is important to combine activities of daily living with minimal access training to maintain our physical and mental well-being. More research is clearly needed in the area of minimal access horticulture to expand this new and exciting subspecialty.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2020.05.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2020.05.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.jmig.2020.05.004,2020-01-01,,,

4143,Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis in Paris: A differential psychological impact between regular intensive care unit staff members and reinforcement workers,"Background Intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To overcome the lack of human resources during this crisis, some ICUs had to mobilise staff from a reinforcement pool, with no or outdated ICU experience. This study aimed to investigate and to compare the psychological impact of the pandemic on regular ICU staff members and reinforcement workers. Material and methods Self-assessment questionnaires were completed by HCWs who worked from March 1 to April 30, 2020, in our 16-bed neurological ICU at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, France, which was converted to a COVID ICU. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire-Revised, and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to assess anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, quality of life, and resilience, respectively. Results Sixty-nine ICU HCWs completed the survey (37 from the team of regular staff members, i.e., from the public health service, and 32 from a reinforcement pool, either from non-ICU public health service or from private healthcare interim employment agencies). Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms was high, at 19%, 9%, and 16%, respectively, with limited impairment in quality of life or resilience scores. Depression symptoms were observed more in regular staff members than in welcomed reinforcement workers, at 16% and 0%, respectively. Conclusions These results revealed that during the pandemic, HCWs from the team of regular staff members were at greater risk of developing psychological disorder compared with reinforcement workers, with higher levels of depressive symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.11.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.11.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.aucc.2020.11.005,2020-01-01,,,
4144,The importance of early use of beta blockers and gastric decontamination in caffeine overdose: A case report,"Caffeine is a common stimulant consumed daily worldwide and available in a wide variety of over-the-counter formulations. It is a mild central nervous system stimulant when used in recommended doses. However, it can be fatal if taken as an intentional or accidental overdose. We report a case of a 48-year-old lady with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder who consumed a significant overdose of caffeine, triggered by the stress that she had contracted coronavirus disease 19. This led to significant cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. The condition was identified early and managed appropriately with early β-blockers and gastric decontamination, which saved her life. There are few studies with regard to such modalities on treatment for caffeine overdose; our patient responded rapidly and favourably to the treatment. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Caffeine overdose is uncommon but one that clinicians should be aware of.

4148,Proposal for a Model of Suicidal Ideation in Medical Students in Colombia: A Simulation Study,"La conducta suicida es un problema de salud pública mundial, y una población en la que se presentan altos índices de prevalencia es la de estudiantes de Medicina, especialmente en el componente de ideación. Diversos modelos han intentado explicarla, pero son pocos los estudios inferenciales en población colombiana. Los modelos de ecuaciones estructurales utilizados en ciencias sociales resultan apropiados para explicar este problema y su poder analítico permite realizar generalizaciones con cierto grado de precisión. Estos análisis requieren una gran cantidad de datos para una estimación robusta, lo que limita su utilidad cuando hay restricciones para acceder a los datos, como sucede actualmente a causa de la COVID-19, y una cuestión que destaca en estos modelos es la evaluación del ajuste. Mediante un conjunto de 1.200 datos simulados, se encontró un adecuado ajuste del modelo a los datos ( x 524 2 = 1.732,300 ; p < 0,001 ; CFI = 0,97; GFI0= 0,97; TLI = 0,97; RMSEA = 0,04 [0,042-0,046]; SRMR = 0,06) para los predictores depresión y carga percibida, cuyos análisis se realizaron en el programa JASP. Se discute el papel de la pertenencia frustrada, la conveniencia del instrumento para evaluarla y consideraciones de seguimiento, evaluación e intervención de la ideación suicida en estudiantes de Medicina. Suicidal behaviour is a global public health problem, and one population group with high prevalence rates is medical students, especially in the ideation component. Various models have tried to explain it, but there are few inferential studies in the Colombian population. The structural equation models used in controlled social sciences to explain this problem and their analytical power allow generalisations to be made with a certain degree of precision. These analyses require a large amount of data for robust estimation, which limits their usability when there are restrictions to access the data, as is the case today due to Covid-19, and a question that stands out in these models is the evaluation of the fit. Through a set of 1,200 simulated data, an appropriate model fit was found ( x 524 2 = 1.732,300 ; p < 0,001 , CFI = 0.97, GFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.04[0.042-0.046], SRMR = 0.06) for the predictors of depression and perceived burdensomeness, which were analysed using the JASP program. The role of thwarted belongingness is discussed, as well as the appropriateness of the assessment instrument used to evaluate it an considerations regarding suicidal ideation monitoring, evaluation and intervention in medical students.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.09.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.09.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.rcp.2020.09.001,2020-01-01,,,

4233,Anxiety and depression and the related factors in nurses of Guilan University of Medical Sciences hospitals during COVID-19: A web-based cross-sectional study,"Background The outbreak of COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge to the health systems in Iran. We aimed to assess the psychological impact of this outbreak on nurses in the hospitals of Guilan University of Medical Sciences that is one of the top provinces of incidence of COVID-19. Methods In a web-based cross-sectional study, 441 nurses working were selected from the hospitals, from 7 to 12 April 2020. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify the factors related to anxiety and depression. Results The majority were in contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (93.4%) and their relatives had been infected with COVID-19 (42%). The mean of anxiety-7 and depression total scores were 8.64 ± 5.60 and 8.48 ± 6.19, respectively. Female (OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.01–10.64), working in COVID-19 designated hospital (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.13–2.93), being suspected with COVID-19 infection (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.25–3.26), and insufficient personal protective equipment (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.68–4.06) were associated with anxiety. Depression was significantly associated with female sex (OR = 4.62, %95 CI = 1.24–17.16), having chronic disease (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.20–3.74), being suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 infection (OR = 3.44, 95% CI = 2.11–5.59, and OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.04–4.70, respectively), and insufficient personal protective equipment (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.19–2.91). Conclusion The finding declares healthcare workers are at high risk for mental illness. Continuous supervision of the psychological consequences following infectious diseases outbreaks should be a part of the preparedness efforts of health care systems.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijans.2020.100233,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijans.2020.100233,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijans.2020.100233,2020-01-01,,,

4306,Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Links and possible consequences,"Objectif La pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 (ou COVID-19) se propage depuis décembre 2019, et a été, comme attendu, accompagnée d’une augmentation drastique de la prévalence des troubles anxieux et dépressifs dans la population générale. Les traumatismes psychologiques peuvent bien sûr, expliquer une partie de ces troubles. Cependant, dans la mesure où les troubles psychiatriques sont également associés à une composante immuno-inflammatoire, les effets directs du virus sur le système immunitaire de l’hôte, avec une réponse inflammatoire marquée, mais également l’inflammation secondaire à ces facteurs de stress psychosociaux, peuvent entraîner l’apparition ou l’aggravation de pathologies psychiatriques. Cet article vise donc à identifier les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 qui pourraient être utiles en termes de dépistage et/ou de prise en charge. Méthode Nous nous sommes appuyés sur les données issues des précédentes pandémies et les données existantes à ce jour sur les conséquences psychopathologiques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2, pour réaliser une revue de la littérature narrative sur les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2. Nous avons ciblé l’environnement gestationnel en raison des risques de troubles neuro-développementaux pour le fœtus, d’une part, et les enfants et adultes directement infectés avec les risques de développer des troubles psychiatriques, d’autre part. Résultats Comme durant les précédentes pandémies, l’activation du système immunitaire due au stress et/ou à l’infection pendant la grossesse pourrait conduire à un risque accru de troubles du neuro-développement chez le fœtus (schizophrénie et troubles du spectre de l’autisme). De plus, chez les individus exposés à des traumatismes psychologiques et/ou infectés par le virus, le risque de troubles psychiatriques, notamment de troubles de l’humeur, est probable. Conclusion Dans ce contexte, des mesures de dépistage et de prise en charge dédiées sont indispensables. Il est, de fait, important de proposer aux individus ayant été infectés par le virus, un suivi rapproché afin de mettre en place une prise en charge la plus précoce possible. De même chez les femmes enceintes, le dépistage de troubles de l’humeur pendant la grossesse ou en post-partum doit être facilité. Le suivi des bébés nés pendant la période pandémique doit être renforcé afin de dépister et de prendre en charge d’éventuels troubles du neuro-développement. Objective The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Method Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. Results As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. Conclusion In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,2020-01-01,,,

4312,Development of a coronavirus social distance attitudes scale,"Objective Our goal was to develop a scale to assess social distance attitudes related to COVID-19. Methods We performed an online national survey of US adults (n = 1,074) to assess social distance attitudes, COVID-19 related beliefs and behaviors, and demographics. We assessed scale structure using confirmatory factor analysis and evaluated internal consistency and validity. We assessed association of scale factors with respondent characteristics. Results Confirmatory factor analysis supported a hypothesized two-factor solution. Internal consistency was high for both positive (Alpha = 0.92) and negative (Alpha = 0.91) attitude factors. Analyses supported construct and predictive validity with expected associations between scale factors and perceived norms and behavior (e.g. trips out of the home). We found an interaction suggesting that holding highly negative attitudes reduced the effect of holding positive beliefs. Both attitude factors were related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Perceived COVID-19 risk (to others but not for self) and perceived severity were consistently associated with higher positive and lower negative attitudes. Conclusion This COVID-19 Social Distance Attitude Scale contains positive and negative factors with high internal consistency and construct and predictive validity. Practice implication A greater understanding and ongoing assessment of COVID-19 social distance attitudes could inform policymakers, researchers, and clinicians who seek to promote protective social distance behaviors.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2020.11.027,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2020.11.027,Scopus,10.1016/j.pec.2020.11.027,2020-01-01,,,

4322,Psychiatric emergencies during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in the suburban New York City area,"Background This report characterizes patients presenting for psychiatric emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic and describes COVID-19-related stressors. Methods Patients seen for emergency psychiatric evaluation during the height of the COVID-19 period (March 1-April 30, 2020; N = 201) were compared with those in the immediate Pre-COVID-19 period (January 1-February 28, 2020; N = 355), on sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric diagnoses, symptoms, and disposition. Patients tested positive for COVID-19 were compared with those that tested negative on the same outcomes. Prevalence and nature of COVID-19-stressors that influenced the emergency presentation were rated. Outcome The most common psychiatric diagnoses and presenting symptoms during both periods were depression and suicidal ideation. Comparing the Pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, a significant decline in emergency psychiatric volume was observed in children and adolescents (C/A), but not adults. COVID-19 period C/A patients had more new onset disorders and were more likely to be admitted to inpatient care, but were less likely to present with suicide attempts, impulse control disorders and agitation/aggression. Adults were more likely to have no access to outpatient care, present with anxiety disorders, and were also more likely to be admitted for inpatient care. COVID-19 directly affected the psychiatric emergency in 25% of patients, with the more severe stressors triggered by fear of COVID infection (including psychosis), actual COVID infection in self or family members, including death of a loved one. COVID-positive patients were more likely to have psychosis, including new-onset, and were less likely to be depressed/suicidal compared to their COVID-negative counterparts. Conclusion This report demonstrates the need for emergency psychiatric services throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for clinical and diagnostic COVID-19 screening of psychiatric emergency patients. New and severe pathology underscore the need for enhanced outpatient access to tele-mental health, crisis hotline and on-line psychotherapeutic services, as well as psychiatric inpatient services with capacity to safely care for COVID-19 patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.029,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.029,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.029,2020-01-01,,,

4336,Contact with blue-green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown beneficial for mental health,"There is growing evidence that ecosystem services and especially the exposure to the natural world (blue-green spaces) have potential benefits for mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) People will show greater symptoms of depression and anxiety under lockdown conditions that did not allow contact with outdoor nature spaces; 2) Where access to public outdoor nature spaces was strictly restricted, (2a) those with green/blue nature view or (2b) access to private outdoor spaces such as a garden or balcony will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a more positive mood. Based on 5218 responses from 9 countries, we found that lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts, especially for those under strict lockdown. People under strict lockdown in Spain (3403 responses), perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health, using the benefits that ecosystem services are providing us.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143984,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143984,Scopus,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143984,2020-01-01,,,

Patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of COVID-19 infection: severe (n = 95) and non-severe (n = 124). ECG findings at the time of admission were recorded for each patient. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were retrieved from electronic medical records. Results Mean age was 65.2 ± 13.8 years in the severe group and was 57.9 ± 16.0 years in the non-severe group. ST depression (28% vs. 14%), T-wave inversion (29% vs. 16%), ST-T changes (36% vs. 21%), and the presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS) (17% vs. 7%) were more frequent in the severe group compared to the non-severe group. Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.03–5.67; p = 0.041), the severity of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.09–2.65; p = 0.026), presence of cardiac injury (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 1.45–7.60; p = 0.004), and d-dimer (OR: 3.60, 95% CI: 1.29–10.06; p = 0.014) were independent predictors of ST-T changes on ECG. Conclusion ST depression, T-wave inversion, ST-T changes, and the presence of fQRS on admission ECG are closely associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.10.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.10.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.10.005,2020-01-01,,,

4433,COVID-19: The possible seasonal shape of things to come,"Introduction The world is currently experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. The northern hemisphere awaits winter with foreboding, anticipating an amplification of the current second wave of COVID-19 concurrent with annual seasonal influenza. Methods This paper attempts to overview current seasonal COVID-19 trends. Results Cases are spiking now in winter in Australia and also in summer weather, such as in Florida. Clearly warm weather does not significantly dampen viral spread unless public health mitigation measures are adhered to. Respiratory pathogens (including influenza), will co-circulate in winter. Co-infection with influenza and COVID-19 may worsen outcomes and mutations of either virus may change and further negatively affect such outcomes. The public in Australia has avidly taken the influenza vaccine and this, along with COVID-19 prevention measures, has drastically curbed influenza spread in this country. Conclusions Countries in the northern hemisphere with high rates of COVID-19 should strive to reduce numbers prior to the onset of winter. Those that managed to maintain low COVID-19 rates due to public health measures should endeavor to maintain this status quo despite opening borders for economically badly needed tourists. Spikes of cases in countries wherein COVID-19 was formerly under control will deter tourists, further depressing beleaguered economies. Vigilance must be maintained until an effective vaccine becomes available. The key is to have public health driven economy whereby opening of borders and activities organized are driven by evidence based public health advice. Influenza vaccination is highly recommended.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105262,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105262,Scopus,10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105262,2020-01-01,,,

Evidence for the psychological problems of COVID-19 patients was limited. Here we report a cross-sectional study of the mental distress and sleep quality of patients in a single center in Wuhan. The study was based on a combined questionnaire of basic questions designed by the study group, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). On Feb 17th and Mar 14th, two groups of patients were recruited respectively in a designated hospital for COVID-19. Univariate analysis and regression models were used to identify predictors for patients' psychological distress and sleep quality. In total, there were 202 participants in our combined sample. The average SAS, SDS, and PSQI score of participants were 44.2, 51.7, and 9.3 respectively. Factors associated with SAS score include gender, subjective evaluation of disease symptoms, and evaluation of medical staffs' attitude. Gender, age, education level, frequency of contacting with family, subjective knowledge level of COVID 19, and evaluation of medical staffs’ attitude are associated with participants SDS score. Factors associated with PSQI score are age and subjective evaluation of disease symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.034,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.034,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.034,2020-01-01,,,

4490,The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child growth and development: a systematic review,"Objective This was a systematic review of studies that examined the impact of epidemics or social restriction on mental and developmental health in parents and children/adolescents. Source of data The PubMed, WHO COVID-19, and SciELO databases were searched on March 15, 2020, and on April 25, 2020, filtering for children (0–18 years) and humans. Synthesis of data The tools used to mitigate the threat of a pandemic such as COVID-19 may very well threaten child growth and development. These tools — such as social restrictions, shutdowns, and school closures — contribute to stress in parents and children and can become risk factors that threaten child growth and development and may compromise the Sustainable Development Goals. The studies reviewed suggest that epidemics can lead to high levels of stress in parents and children, which begin with concerns about children becoming infected. These studies describe several potential mental and emotional consequences of epidemics such as COVID-19, H1N1, AIDS, and Ebola: severe anxiety or depression among parents and acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, and depression among children. These data can be related to adverse childhood experiences and elevated risk of toxic stress. The more adverse experiences, the greater the risk of developmental delays and health problems in adulthood, such as cognitive impairment, substance abuse, depression, and non-communicable diseases. Conclusion Information about the impact of epidemics on parents and children is relevant to policy makers to aid them in developing strategies to help families cope with epidemic/pandemic-driven adversity and ensure their children’s healthy development.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.08.008,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.08.008,Scopus,10.1016/j.jped.2020.08.008,2020-01-01,,,

El objetivo del presente estudio fue evaluar los factores que pueden desestabilizar la salud mental de dichos profesionales en nuestro contexto. Materiales y métodos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 421 profesionales de la salud. Los datos se recogieron mediante un cuestionario online que se les envió a través del correo electrónico. Se empleó el DASS-21 para evaluar las variables de ansiedad, estrés y depresión, y la EAI para medir las dificultades con el sueño. Además, se recogieron otras variables descriptivas de la muestra que podrían estar relacionadas con estos niveles de sintomatología psicológica. Resultados Los resultados muestran que la pandemia de la COVID-19ha generado entre el personal sanitario síntomas de estrés, ansiedad, depresión e insomnio, con mayores niveles entre las mujeres y profesionales de más edad. Variables como haber estado en contacto con el virus o el miedo en el trabajo desencadenaron una mayor sintomatología. Conclusiones En esta situación crítica, el colectivo de profesionales se sitúa en primera línea, por lo que está expuesto directamente determinados riesgos y estresores. Esto contribuye a que desarrollen sintomatología psicológica diversa. Consecuentemente, se recomienda ofrecerles ayuda psicológica para reducir el impacto emocional del COVID-19 y asegurar así no solo su salud mental, sino también el adecuado cuidado que dispensan. Introduction After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. Results The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. Conclusions In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004,2020-01-01,,,
4529,Strategies to Promote Social Connections Among Older Adults During “Social Distancing” Restrictions,"Older age and medical comorbidity are factors associated with more severe illness and risk of death due to COVID-19 infection. Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for coronavirus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. In this paper, the authors describe a cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness, including evidence-informed strategies clinicians can use to help patients develop a “Connections Plan” to stay connected and promote their social, mental, and physical health during “social distancing” restrictions. This set of strategies can be provided during brief (30 minute) telephone sessions and is analogous to creating a “Safety Plan” for suicide risk. The approach is illustrated with three case examples.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.004,2020-01-01,,,

4541,The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Canadian critical care nurses providing patient care during the early phase pandemic: A mixed method study,"Background Healthcare workers have historically experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety with previous infectious outbreaks. It is unknown if critical care nurses have similar experiences. Objectives The study aimed to examine the mental health of Critical Care Registered Nurses providing direct patient care during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Design This was a convergent parallel mixed method study utilizing validated questionnaires and semi-structured qualitative interviews. Setting Critical care units in a single large 650 bed academic teaching hospital in western Canada. The critical care units serve a general mixed medical – surgical adult patient population. Participants Critical Care Registered Nurses providing direct patient care in the intensive care and high acuity units at the designated site. Methods 109 participants completed two self-reported validated surveys, the Impact of Events Scale – Revised and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. 15 participants completed one-on-one semi-structured interviews that were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Results In the surveys, the participants reported clinical concern for (23%), probable (13%) and significant (38%) symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as mild to severe depression (57%), anxiety (67%) and stress (54%). In the interviews, psychological distress was described as anxiety, worry, distress and fear related to: 1) rapidly changing policy and information, 2) overwhelming and unclear communication, 3) meeting patient care needs in new ways while staying safe, and 4) managing home and personal commitments to self and family. Conclusions Critical care nurses experienced psychological distress associated with providing care to COVID-19 patients during the early phases of the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2020.102999,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2020.102999,Scopus,10.1016/j.iccn.2020.102999,2020-01-01,,,

4593,The psychological and social impacts on personal stress for residents quarantined for COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia,"Objective The study investigates psychological and social moderators of anxiety, depression, and personal stress in Saudi Arabian residents quarantined for COVID-19. Methods Data were collected from 200 participants quarantined in Saudi Arabia using the Emotion Regulation Scale (ERQ), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Multiple regression analyses were carried out in SPSS. Results The results indicated that the overall prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and stress were 40.5%, 57.5%, and 55.5%, respectively. Cognitive reappraisal, satisfaction with life, and the social support of friends reduced depression and stress in quarantine. Additionally, females were more likely to be anxious but less likely to be depressed, while older residents generally experienced fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Conclusion The findings indicate that residents in quarantine, especially younger people, experienced high levels of anxiety and depression. Therefore, continuous psychological monitoring and mental health support may need to be integrated into health care during pandemics.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2020.09.008,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2020.09.008,Scopus,10.1016/j.apnu.2020.09.008,2020-01-01,,,

4596,Psychological distress in adults with and without cystic fibrosis during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Background Hundreds of papers have been published on the COVID-19 pandemic, and several of them on psychological themes connected with it, but very little is so far known on how adult patients with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCFs) are coping with this dramatic event. Methods An online questionnaire was developed according to the Italian validated COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) and addressed to the general population (GP). A similar questionnaire, augmented with CF specific questions, targeted pwCFs. The two web-based surveys were accessible for some weeks during the lockdown mandated by the Italian government. Results The CF questionnaire was completed by 712 adult pwCFs (422 females), matched for sex and age with a 1/5 ratio to GP questionnaire respondents. Mild or medium distress affected 40.2% of pwCFs and 43.9% of GP controls, severe distress 5.3% of pwCFs and 6.2% of GP controls. The level of psychological distress was not correlated with the degree of pulmonary function impairment. When symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were independently analyzed, the control group featured a 55% higher level of mild-moderate anxiety symptoms. Signs of psychological distress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were significantly more frequent in female pwCFs compared to males, similarly to GP. Conclusion Adult pwCFs seem to have equal, and in some domains, lower levels of psychological distress than GP controls. This might be sustained by lifelong experiences in coping with the demands of their chronic disease. These results may orient future psychological interventions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2020.12.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2020.12.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcf.2020.12.016,2020-01-01,,,

4616,Cardiac Injury and Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 in New York City,"Background Prior studies demonstrated that elevated troponin in patients with COVID-19 was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. However, the association of cardiac injury and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of cardiac injury with ECG abnormality and with in-hospital mortality. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 between 13 March and 31 March 2020. Those patients with troponin I measurement were included in the study and divided into those who had elevated troponin I (cardiac injury group) and those who did not (no cardiac injury group). Statistical analyses were performed to compare differences between the groups, and a multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to assess the effect of cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality. Results One hundred and eight-one (181) patients were included, 54 of whom were in the cardiac injury group and 127 in the no cardiac injury group. The mean age was 64.0±16.6 years and 55.8% were male. The cardiac injury group was more likely to be older, have a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure compared to the no cardiac injury group (all p<0.05); there was no difference in presence of chest pain (cardiac injury group versus no cardiac injury group: 17.0% versus 22.5%, p=0.92); the cardiac injury group had a significantly higher value of brain natriuretic peptide, procalcitonin, interleukin-6 and D-dimer (all p<0.05); they had numerically more frequent ECG abnormalities such as T wave inversion (13.2% versus 7.5%, p=0.23) and ST depression (1.9% versus 0.0%, p=0.13) although statistically not significant; they had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (42.3% versus 12.6%, p<0.001). With a multivariate logistic regression model, age (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.033 [1.002–1.065], p=0.034) and cardiac injury (3.25 [1.40–7.54], p=0.006) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 with elevated troponin I had a relatively low proportion of chest pain and ECG abnormality. Cardiac injury was independently associated with in-hospital mortality.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.10.025,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.10.025,Scopus,10.1016/j.hlc.2020.10.025,2020-01-01,,,

4618,Higher Executive Control Network Coherence Buffers Against Puberty-Related Increases in Internalizing Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background Early pubertal maturation has been posited to be a biopsychosocial risk factor for the onset of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence; further, early-maturing youths exhibit heightened reactivity to stressful events. School closures and enforced social distancing, as well as health and financial uncertainties, during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to adversely affect mental health in youths, particularly adolescents who are already at risk for experiencing emotional difficulties. The executive control network (ECN) supports cognitive processes required to successfully navigate novel challenges and regulate emotions in stressful contexts. Methods We examined whether functional coherence of the ECN, measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 5 years before the pandemic (T1), is a neurobiological marker of resilience to increases in the severity of internalizing symptoms during COVID-19 in adolescents who were in more advanced stages of puberty at T1 relative to their same-age peers (N = 85, 49 female). Results On average, participants reported an increase in symptoms from the 3 months before pandemic to the 2 most recent weeks during the pandemic. We found that early-maturing youths exhibited greater increases in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic if their ECN coherence was low; in contrast, relative pubertal stage was not associated with changes in internalizing symptoms in adolescents with higher ECN coherence at T1. Conclusions These findings highlight the role of the functional architecture of the brain that supports executive functioning in protecting against risk factors that may exacerbate symptoms of internalizing psychopathology during periods of stress and uncertainty.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.08.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.08.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.08.010,2020-01-01,,,

4629,Pandemic-related mental health risk among front line personnel,"The mental health of frontline workers is critical to a community's ability to manage crises and disasters. This study assessed risks for mental health problems (traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, insomnia) in association with pandemic-related stressors in a sample of emergency and hospital personnel (N = 571). Respondents completed self-report surveys online from April 1st to May 7th, 2020 in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Results showed that roughly fifteen to thirty percent of respondents screened positive for each disorder. Odds of screening positive were similar between groups for probable acute traumatic stress, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder; emergency personnel reported significantly higher rates of insufficient sleep than healthcare workers. Logistic regressions showed that respondents who reported having an immunocompromised condition had higher odds of acute traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. Having an immunocompromised household member was associated with higher odds of insufficient sleep and anxiety. Being in a direct care provision role was associated with higher odds of screening positive for risky alcohol use. Being in a management role over direct care providers was associated with higher odds of screening positive for anxiety, risky alcohol use, and insufficient sleep. There was an inverse relationship between number of positive COVID-19 cases and anxiety, such that as positive cases went up, anxiety decreased. Overall, the mental health risks that we observed early in the COVID-19 pandemic are elevated above previous viral outbreaks (SARS) and comparable to rates shown in disasters (9/11 attacks; Hurricane Katrina).",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.045,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.045,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.045,2020-01-01,,,

4634,COVID-19 lockdown impact on cognitions and emotions experienced during sexual intercourse,"Objectives To study the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on cognitions and emotions felt during sexual intercourse by analyzing the responses of 1079 French-speaking subjects (338 men, 741 women, median age: 31 years) who participated in an online survey between April 27 and May 11, 2020. Method Negative sexual cognitions (NSC), positive sexual emotions (PSE) and negative sexual emotions (NSE) are assessed using a tool inspired by the Sexual Mode Questionnaire. Data are crossed with sociodemographic indicators, information on lockdown modalities, indices on sex life, information on psychological functioning and sexual satisfaction. Main results One third of the participants saw a decrease in the frequency of their sexual activities or in their sexual satisfaction. Changes in NSCs were found in 74.4% of subjects (increase: 38.4%; decrease: 36%). Emotional changes are found in between 50.7% (NSC: increase: 20.2%; decrease: 30.5%) and 60.9% (PSE: increase: 24.6%; decrease: 36.3%) of participants. The effect of lockdown on NSC, NSE, and PSE depends on gender at birth, intensity of depressive symptoms, and attachment styles. Women appear to be more vulnerable to lockdown than men. Insecure or depressed subjects also appear more vulnerable. The lockdown impact also depends on changes in the frequency of physical/digital intercourse during lockdown and the modalities of confinement. Changes in NSC, NSE, and PSE had a significant effect on sexual satisfaction during lockdown. Conclusion The lockdown impact on sexual emotions and cognitions is non-negligible and greater than the impact on sexual behaviors. Whether it is positive or negative, it asks about the post-confinement repercussions: what becomes of a positive impact with deconfinement? Will the negative impacts be one-off or will vulnerabilities be expressed over the long-term?",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2020.11.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2020.11.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.sexol.2020.11.002,2020-01-01,,,

We present a case of a young veteran who presented with e-cigarette vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) to a primary care clinic and who required subsequent inpatient admission and home oxygen therapy after discharge. The patient afterwards improved after a three-month course of steroids and cessation of THC-containing electronic cigarettes, consistent with previously reported cases. Furthermore, evidence on bronchoscopy and biopsy demonstrated intracellular lipid droplets in the patient's macrophages. This outpatient case of EVALI prompts primary care providers to raise suspicion of this condition, and enquire about the use of e-cigarettes, particularly THC-containing vaping products. Furthermore, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, similar clinical and radiographic presentations between COVID-19 and EVALI can be seen.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2020.101154,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2020.101154,Scopus,10.1016/j.rmcr.2020.101154,2020-01-01,,,

4660,Does greenery experienced indoors and outdoors provide an escape and support mental health during the COVID-19 quarantine?,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed people's ability to recreate in public green spaces, which is likely to exacerbate the psychological impacts of the pandemic. In the current study, we seek to understand whether greenery can support mental health even with insufficient outdoor exposure in times of physical isolation from the outdoor environment. Methods Between 17 May and 10 June, 2020, we conducted an online survey among 323 students (21.99 ± 3.10 years; 31% male) in health-related programs from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Severities of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. We employed two self-reported measures of greenery experienced indoors (number of houseplants in the home and proportion of exterior greenery visible from inside the home) and two measures of greenery experienced outdoors (presence/absence of a domestic garden and availability of neighborhood greenery). Restorative quality of the home (the “being away” dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale; PRS) and the neighborhood (the “being away” and “fascination” dimensions of the PRS), engagement with outdoor greenery (frequency of different types of interaction) and perceived social support were treated as mediators. Associations between greenery and mental health were tested using generalized linear regression and logistic regression. Structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques were used to test the theoretically-indicated relations among the variables. Results Clinically-meaningful symptoms of moderate depression and anxiety were reported by approximately 33% and 20% of the students, respectively. The relative abundance of greenery visible from the home or in the neighborhood was associated with reduced depressive/anxiety symptoms and lower depression/anxiety rates. Having more houseplants or a garden was also associated with some of these markers of mental health. As hypothesized, the mental health-supportive effects of indoor greenery were largely explained by increased feelings of being away while at home. Neighborhood greenery contributed to neighborhood restorative quality, which in turn facilitated social support and more frequent engagement with greenery, and that led to better mental health. Conclusions Students who spent most of their time at home during the COVID-19 epidemic experienced better mental health when exposed to more greenery. Our findings support the idea that exposure to greenery may be a valuable resource during social isolation in the home. However, causal interpretation of these associations is not straightforward.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110420,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110420,Scopus,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110420,2020-01-01,,,

4686,"48th SME North American manufacturing research conference, NAMRC 48 (Cancelled due to COVID-19) influence of 3D topography on tribological behavior of grinding wheel","Grinding is extensively used as surface generation process in finishing operations, which makes it imperative that the generated surface adheres closely to strict quality check norms failing which the component will be rejected incurring a loss to the industry. To ensure the intended surface quality falls within tolerances, the grinding wheel plays an important role as an abrasive tool. The finished surface is a direct outcome of grinding wheel topography and its various microscopic interactions with the surface creating a compelling need for in-depth understanding. Study and characterization of grinding wheel topography in the present paper aim to understand the behavior of forces in the contact area. Due to stochastic abrasive grain distribution and quasi-static surface wear, 3-dimensional parameters hold a better physical significance in explaining the nature of microscopic interactions and their impact on the behavior of forces. Experiments are performed in a manner to wear out grinding wheels of the same specification with varying number of passes in an attempt to highlight the influence of varying topography on tribological interactions in the grind zone. The variation in topography at a specific interval of time is captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope and further processed for surface characterization whereas forces are captured using a dynamometer. SEM micrographs are presented to understand the type of wear on the wheel surface.

4690,Increasing Social Connectedness for Underserved Older Adults Living With Depression: A Pre-Post Evaluation of PEARLS,"Objective To evaluate PEARLS effectiveness for increasing social connectedness among underserved older adults with depression. Design Multisite, pre-post single-group evaluation. Setting Community-based social service organizations (N = 16) in five U.S. states, purposively sampled for maximum variation of participants and providers. Participants A total of 320 homebound older adults (mean(SD) age 72.9(9.6), 79% female, 44% people of color, 81% low-income, 61% living alone, average four chronic conditions) with clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 mean(SD) 12.7(4.6)). Intervention Four to 6 month home-based depression care management model delivered by trained front-line providers. Measurements Brief validated social connectedness scales: Duke Social Support Index 10-item (DSSI-10), PROMIS-Social Isolation (6-item), UCLA-Loneliness (3-item); sociodemographic and health measures. Results At baseline, PEARLS participants overall and with ≥1 of the following characteristics were less socially connected: younger (50–64), white, LGBTQ+, not partnered, not caregiving, living alone, financial limitations, chronic conditions, and/or recently hospitalized. Six-months post-PEARLS enrollment, participants significantly increased social interactions and satisfaction with social support (DSSI-10 t[312] = 5.2, p <0.001); and reduced perceived isolation (PROMIS t[310] = 6.3, p <0.001); and loneliness (UCLA t[301] = 3.7, p =0.002), with small to moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d DSSI-10: 0.28, PROMIS-SI: 0.35, UCLA: 0.21). Increased social connectedness was associated with reduced depression. Improvements in social connectedness (except social interactions) persisted during early COVID-19. Being Latino and/or having difficulty paying for basic needs was associated with less improvement in post-PEARLS social connectedness. Conclusion PEARLS has potential to improve social connectedness among underserved older adults, though additional supports may be needed for persons facing multiple social determinants of health. Further research is needed to establish causality.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.005,2020-01-01,,,

4697,Pathogenicity of a QX-like avian infectious bronchitis virus isolated in China,"Avian infectious bronchitis is a serious and highly contagious disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). We isolated a highly virulent IBV strain (CK/CH/JS/TAHY) from kidneys of diseased chickens. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene revealed that CK/CH/JS/TAHY clustered with the QX-like type. The S1 gene has 1,620 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of 540 amino acids with typical coronavirus cleavage recognition sites of HRRR. About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 105.5 EID50 exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect. In conclusion, the IBV strain is a virulent avian IBV and that exhibited severe pathogenicity in chickens and is a vaccine candidate to prevent infection by Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV strains.",,https://www.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez568,https://www.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez568,Scopus,10.3382/ps/pez568,2020-01-01,,,
