67,The effects of COVID-19 lockdown on lifestyle and emotional state in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology: Results of an Italian survey,"Purpose On March 8, 2020, the Italian Government implemented extraordinary measures to limit viral transmission of COV-19/SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on lifestyle and emotional state in women planning infertility treatments. Basic Procedures We performed a quantitative research study using a web-based survey, in 140 women referred to Assisted Reproductive Technologies Center. Main findings We observed changes in body weight during lockdown in 80 % of women, and a significant increase in BMI in comparison to that observed before (p=.001). We observed a high percentage of non-adherence to the Mediterranean pattern during lockdown due to higher frequency of consumption of sweet/pastries, cheese and meat, rather than fruit, vegetables and legumes. Before lockdown 36.4 % women were snack consumers while during lockdown 55 % (p=.002). By considering individuals’ attitude to snack consumption, we observed an increase related to boredom (p=<.0001) and anxiety (p=.05) during lockdown. Increased levels of anxiety and sadness were observed in about 30 %, and of boredom in 25 %. The percentage of women worried about their planning infertility treatment was more than 50 %.

70,"Younger people are more vulnerable to stress, anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic: A global cross-sectional survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-ranging consequences for general physical and mental health. Country-specific research reveals a general reduction in mental and physical well-being, due to measures undertaken to stop the spread of COVID-19 disease. However, research is yet to examine the impact of the pandemic on global psychological distress and its effects upon vulnerable groups. Exploration of the factors that potentially mediate the relationship between stress and mental health during this period is needed, to assist in undertaking concrete measures to mitigate psychological distress and support vulnerable groups. Therefore, this study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress globally, and identified factors that may exacerbate decline in mental health. N = 1653 participants (mean age 42.90 ± 13.63 years; 30.3% males) from 63 countries responded to the survey. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and State Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Other measures included the Perceived Stress Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Globally, consistently high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and poor sleep were observed regardless of number of COVID-19 cases. Over 70% of the respondents had greater than moderate levels of stress, with 59% meeting the criteria for clinically significant anxiety and 39% reporting moderate depressive symptoms. People with a prior mental health diagnosis experienced greater psychological distress. Poor sleep, lower levels of resilience, younger age and loneliness significantly mediated the links between stress and depression, and stress and anxiety. Age-based differences revealed that younger age-groups were more vulnerable to stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Results show that these vulnerable individuals need more support. Age-specific interventions for modifiable factors that mediate the psychological distress need to urgently deployed to address the global mental health pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110236,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110236,Scopus,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110236,2021-07-13,,,
71,Pediatric emergency department utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City,"Objectives This study describes the utilization of a pediatric emergency department (ED) during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the initial U.S. epicenter, including the impact on visit acuity and incidences of common diagnoses. Study Design We performed an observational retrospective review of patients younger than 18 years old seen in a New York City pediatric ED from March 7th to May 6th 2020, and during the same time period in 2018 and 2019. Demographics, visit details, diagnoses, and dispositions were compared. Validated algorithms were utilized to create practical diagnosis groupings and to determine the probability of a visit requiring emergent evaluation. Results ED visits during the pandemic decreased by 56% to an average daily census of 67 patients, from an anticipated 152. Admission rates rose from 13.3% to 17.4% (p<0.001), and the proportion of triage Emergency Severity Index level 1 and 2 patients increased by 23.7% (p<0.001). Non-emergent visits dropped from 32.3% to 27.5% (p<0.001). Several common, often low-acuity diagnoses saw disproportionate reductions in visits including headache, chest pain, and minor injuries. Concerningly, visits for suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or self-harm increased by 100% (p<0.001) and visits for evaluating abuse or neglect decreased by 89% (p=0.01). Conclusions Pediatric ED utilization substantially deceased during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, but left relatively higher patient acuity. Healthcare systems in early epicenters must also prepare for the disproportionate impact a pandemic has on the most vulnerable pediatric patients, particularly those at risk for self-harm or abuse.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.02.029,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.02.029,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajem.2021.02.029,2021-07-01,,,
72,Investigating how individual differences influence responses to the COVID-19 crisis: The role of maladaptive and five-factor personality traits,"Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic impacted both the physical and psychological aspects of people's lives. Personality traits are one of the factors that explain the diverse responses to stressful situations. This study aimed to investigate whether five-factor and maladaptive personality traits are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicide risk, self-reported COVID-19 symptoms, and preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, comprehensively. Methods We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of 1000 Koreans between May 8 to 13, 2020. Participants' five-factor and maladaptive personality traits were measured using the multidimensional personality inventory, the Bright and Dark Personality Inventory. COVID-19 symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicide risk, and preventive behaviors were also measured. Results The results revealed that maladaptive personality traits (e.g., negative affectivity, detachment) had positive correlations with depressive and anxiety symptoms, suicide risk, and COVID-19 symptoms, and the five-factor personality traits (e.g., agreeableness, conscientiousness) had positive correlations with preventive behaviors. Conclusion Our findings extend the current understanding of the relationship between five-factor and maladaptive personality traits and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Longitudinal follow-up should further investigate the influence of personality traits on an individual's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110786,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110786,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110786,2021-07-01,,,
73,Implementation of a fully digital histology course in the anatomical teaching curriculum during COVID-19 pandemic,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, many medical schools are forced to switch courses of the mandatory curriculum to online teaching formats. However, little information about feasibility and effectiveness is available yet about distance teaching in anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a histology course previously taught in a classroom setting into an online-only format based on video conference software. Methods Our course design included theoretical introductions, an online-adaptation of virtual microscopy used previously in the classroom, and active learning elements such as collaborative learning in breakout rooms, annotation assignments and multiple-choice questions. Two preclinical semester cohorts of around 400 second and third semester students were taught in histology in parallel courses, using the Zoom software platform. We analyzed data about student attendance during the course, summative quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the students and results of a written test required to pass the course. Results We observed that student attendance was high and stable during the 19 course days for both second and third semester, and only few students reported technical problems. There were no significant differences in examination results of second semester compared to the third semester, an unexpected result as the third semester already participated in the dissection course before. Similarly, no significant gender-related effects on the examination performance could be noted in both semesters. However, the age of students was negatively correlated with test scores in the second and third semester. Importantly, the overall evaluation of the digital version of the histology course was at least as positive as the in-person version over the past years. Conclusion Together, we experienced that the implementation of a curricular histology course in an online-format is technically realizable, effective and well accepted among students. We also observed that availability and prior experience with digitized specimen in virtual microscopy facilitates transition into an online-only setting. Thus, our study supports the positive potential of distance learning for teaching anatomy during and after COVID-19 pandemic but also emphasizes the need for a synchronous learning environment with partially personnel-intensive small group settings to overcome passivity and inequality aspects, and to foster active learning elements.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aanat.2021.151718,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aanat.2021.151718,Scopus,10.1016/j.aanat.2021.151718,2021-07-01,,,
74,Consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies: Implications for future research,"This article provides an overview of extant literature addressing consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies. Six focal cutting-edge technologies are identified: artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, wearable technology, robotics and big data analytics. Our analysis shows research on consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies is at a nascent stage, and there are several gaps requiring attention. To further advance knowledge, our article offers avenues for future interdisciplinary research addressing implications of consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies. More specifically, we propose six main areas for future research namely: rethinking consumer behaviour models, identifying behavioural differences among different generations of consumers, understanding how consumers interact with automated services, ethics, privacy and the blackbox, consumer security concerns and consumer interaction with new-age technologies during and after a major global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106761,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106761,Scopus,10.1016/j.chb.2021.106761,2021-07-01,,,

76,"Climate change, environment pollution, COVID-19 pandemic and mental health","Converging data would indicate the existence of possible relationships between climate change, environmental pollution and epidemics/pandemics, such as the current one due to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each of these phenomena has been supposed to provoke detrimental effects on mental health. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to review the available scientific literature on these variables in order to suggest and comment on their eventual synergistic effects on mental health. The available literature report that climate change, air pollution and COVID-19 pandemic might influence mental health, with disturbances ranging from mild negative emotional responses to full-blown psychiatric conditions, specifically, anxiety and depression, stress/trauma-related disorders, and substance abuse. The most vulnerable groups include elderly, children, women, people with pre-existing health problems especially mental illnesses, subjects taking some types of medication including psychotropic drugs, individuals with low socio-economic status, and immigrants. It is evident that COVID-19 pandemic uncovers all the fragility and weakness of our ecosystem, and inability to protect ourselves from pollutants. Again, it underlines our faults and neglect towards disasters deriving from climate change or pollution, or the consequences of human activities irrespective of natural habitats and constantly increasing the probability of spillover of viruses from animals to humans. In conclusion, the psychological/psychiatric consequences of COVID-19 pandemic, that currently seem unavoidable, represent a sharp cue of our misconception and indifference towards the links between our behaviour and their influence on the “health” of our planet and of ourselves. It is time to move towards a deeper understanding of these relationships, not only for our survival, but for the maintenance of that balance among man, animals and environment at the basis of life in earth, otherwise there will be no future.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145182,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145182,Scopus,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145182,2021-06-15,,,
77,Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: The importance of the vagus nerve for biopsychosocial resilience,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread increases in mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. The development of these and other psychiatric disorders may be related to changes in immune, endocrine, autonomic, cognitive, and affective processes induced by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, many of these same changes can be triggered by psychosocial stressors such as social isolation and rejection, which have become increasingly common due to public policies aimed at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The present review aims to shed light on these issues by describing how viral infections and stress affect mental health. First, we describe the multi-level mechanisms linking viral infection and life stress exposure with risk for psychopathology. Then, we summarize how resilience can be enhanced by targeting vagus nerve function by, for example, applying transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and targeting lifestyle factors, such as exercise. With these biopsychosocial insights in mind, researchers and healthcare professionals will be better equipped to reduce risk for psychopathology and increase resilience during this challenging pandemic period and beyond.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.02.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.02.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.02.010,2021-06-01,,,

80,Wide-range direct detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<inf>3</inf> using polyethylene-glycol-free gold nanorod based on LSPR aptasensor,"Vitamin D is associated with various diseases such as obesity, digestive problems, osteoporosis, depression, and infections, which has emerged as an interest in public healthcare. Recently, vitamin D has received more attention because of the potential implication with coronavirus disease 2019. In this study, we developed a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) aptasensor based on polyethylene-glycol(PEG)-free gold nanorods (AuNRs) for the wide-range and direct detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The surfactant on AuNRs was removed by exchanging with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) instead of PEG then the PSS was exchanged with citrate. By exchanging the stabilizer of AuNRs from PEG to PEG-free (i.e., citrate), the sensing efficiency of LSPR aptasensor was significantly improved. Additionally, LSPR aptasensor was functionalized with aptamer and blocking agent to enhance the sensing performance. The LSPR aptasensor achieved the direct, highly sensitive, and selective detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 over a wide concentration range (0.1–105 ng/mL), with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mL. This detection range included the concentration of vitamin D from deficiency to excess.

81,Emotional eating during COVID-19 in the United Kingdom: Exploring the roles of alexithymia and emotion dysregulation,"Emotional eating, generally defined as (over)-eating in response to negative emotions, has been associated with poor physical and psychological outcomes. During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19. We discuss how these findings should be applied, and recommendations for future research.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105120,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105120,Scopus,10.1016/j.appet.2021.105120,2021-06-01,,,
82,A real-world ten-week follow-up of the COVID outbreak in an outpatient drug clinic in Salamanca (Spain),"Objective To compare over ten weeks the number of relapses, hospital admissions, calls made, admissions to therapeutic communities, face-to-face visits, treatment adjustment, number of injectables administered, and number of emergencies attended due to emotional and behavioral alterations and/or substance use disorder, and to describe and quantify social emergencies in an outpatient drug clinic (ODC) in Salamanca (Spain) from March 16, 2020, to May 22, 2020. Methods This is an ecological study of the COVID pandemic over ten weeks. The study examines the set of alcohol or other drug-dependent or dual disorder patients in the population of Salamanca, Spain. The measurements were: professionals; calls made; percentage of successful calls; face-to-face visits; first visits made; reviews made; techniques; injectable treatments; other treatments; evolution; relapses. The ODC includes about 375 new patients each year and another 650 other patients annually. Results The study found the number of relapses to be greater in the last five weeks of the 10-week study period. Patients' psychopathological instability also increased, and face-to-face visits were necessary. The most frequent psychopathology that required face-to-face intervention was depressive disorder. The number of interventions with patients increased. In parallel, social workers' efforts were greater after the seventh week. There was a decrease in response to calls. Throughout this time, the ODC attended to patients who needed to be treated for the first time. Conclusions Confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic generated maladaptive emotional responses and other behaviors, such as excessive alcohol consumption. The number of face-to-face consultations, admissions, and referrals to therapeutic communities increased. Patients under stress and in social isolation resorted more often to substance use. The ODC had to adopt a flexible approach to evaluate patients with more serious problems, by using face-to-face assessments.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108303,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108303,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108303,2021-06-01,,,

In this study, we evaluated changing income, self-restraint, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress, and ego-resiliency, to investigate the main and moderating effects of ego-resiliency on psychological distress. We analyzed 222 Japanese samples from the dataset of Primary Survey in Japan (PSJ) in the Resilience to COVid-19 in Each Region (RE-COVER) project. The results showed significant main effects of ego-resiliency on depression and stress, and a significant interaction effect of self-restraint and ego-resiliency on depression. We also tested the significance of the moderating effect of ego-resiliency on the relationship between self-restraint and depression. The simple slope of ego-resiliency was only significant for individuals with high self-restraint. Our findings provide empirical evidence on mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among the Japanese population, proving that ego-resiliency functioned to cope with the specific stresses associated with COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110702,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110702,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110702,2021-06-01,,,

An online sample of 2860 Croatian adults filled in questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics, distress (the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21), coping (the Brief COPE), personality (the International Personality Item Pool), and social support (the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire) during the COVID-19 lockdown and after the capital was hit by an earthquake. Results indicated that 15.9% of the respondents experienced severe to extreme depression, 10.7% severe to extreme anxiety, and 26.2% severe to extreme stress. The hierarchical regressions analysis indicated that the considered variables explained a substantial percentage of the variance in depression (51.4%), anxiety (35.2%), and stress (45.5%). Main predictors of emotional distress were lower scores of Emotional Stability, higher scores of Agreeableness, avoidant coping, lack of active coping and perceived social support. The negative effect of the earthquake was weak. Results provide information on a broad range of potentially protective or vulnerability factors that could help identify those at risk for developing coronavirus-related psychological distress. Findings suggest that promoting active coping styles and social interactions could be preventive and potentially therapeutic in general populations.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110691,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110691,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110691,2021-06-01,,,
86,Personality and motivational predictors of well-being and coping during COVID-19: A reversal theory analysis,"This study used reversal theory to examine motivational predictors of well-being and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. 149 UK based respondents completed an online survey including measures of demographics, well-being, coping, motivational style, and dominance. Well-being was predicted by optimism (positively), autic and mastery (negatively) dominances, by alloic sympathy, optimism and paratelic motivation styles (positively), and, negatively by arousal seeking, arousability and pessimism. Coping was positively predicted by optimism and negativism dominances and by negativist, paratelic and telic motivations, and, negatively by arousability and pessimism. Using motivational dominances, indirect support was identified for the link between psychodiversity and well-being, but not coping. Findings suggest that well-being and, to a lesser degree, coping could be enhanced by encouraging individuals to experience a range of motivations, possibly focusing on those identified here as significant predictors. Future research needs to determine the context specificity of these findings and explore psychodiversity, well-being and coping using both metamotivational states and composite profiles incorporating the full range of motivational constructs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110703,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110703,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110703,2021-06-01,,,

88,Machine learning techniques and older adults processing of online information and misinformation: A covid 19 study,"This study is informed by two research gaps. One, Artificial Intelligence's (AI's) Machine Learning (ML) techniques have the potential to help separate information and misinformation, but this capability has yet to be empirically verified in the context of COVID-19. Two, while older adults can be particularly susceptible to the virus as well as its online infodemic, their information processing behaviour amid the pandemic has not been understood. Therefore, this study explores and understands how ML techniques (Study 1), and humans, particularly older adults (Study 2), process the online infodemic regarding COVID-19 prevention and cure. Study 1 employed ML techniques to classify information and misinformation. They achieved a classification accuracy of 86.7% with the Decision Tree classifier, and 86.67% with the Convolutional Neural Network model. Study 2 then investigated older adults' information processing behaviour during the COVID-19 infodemic period using some of the posts from Study 1. Twenty older adults were interviewed. They were found to be more willing to trust traditional media rather than new media. They were often left confused about the veracity of online content related to COVID-19 prevention and cure. Overall, the paper breaks new ground by highlighting how humans' information processing differs from how algorithms operate. It offers fresh insights into how during a pandemic, older adults—a vulnerable demographic segment—interact with online information and misinformation. On the methodological front, the paper represents an intersection of two very disparate paradigms—ML techniques and interview data analyzed using thematic analysis and concepts drawn from grounded theory to enrich the scholarly understanding of human interaction with cutting-edge technologies.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106716,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106716,Scopus,10.1016/j.chb.2021.106716,2021-06-01,,,
89,Factors influencing mental health among American youth in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic,"Objective The article aims to show the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health of American youth. It also aims to identify factors that have an impact on the mental health maintenance of young Americans. The conducted analyses are an attempt at explaining the influence of high psycho-social stress on the mental health of young people. Methods Secondary data from representative research conducted among the inhabitants of the United States of America on the sample of 10,139 respondents has been used in the analysis. The data is derived from the Pew Research Center, American Trends Panel. Results The data analysis indicates that among all the age categories the highest levels of mental discomfort have been observed among the youngest Americans aged 18–29. The majority of respondents experienced anxiety and depression. The results of analyses of the youngest respondents (sample n = 1083) have shown that there are a few factors which have impact on mental health of the young generation. Males, people living in relationships, practising religion more often, having a better financial situation, conservative beliefs and being devoid of citizenship had a better mental condition. Owned social, economic and cultural resources protect young Americans against the Covid-19 pandemic. Conclusions The conducted research confirms the hypothesis that younger generations struggle hard to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic and related difficulties. Due to the conducted analyses, the variables responsible for the deterioration of mental health in younger generations may be indicated.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110711,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110711,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110711,2021-06-01,,,
90,"Measuring COVID-19-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students","The present study describes the adaption and validation of a brief measure of contagion-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students in Australia at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong's (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n = 154), Indian (n = 111), and Nepali (n = 149) university students studying in Australia in May–June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity. Differences in the performance of the Fear of Infection and Existential Threat scales are considered in terms of the respective objective and subjective nature of the constructs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110693,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110693,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110693,2021-06-01,,,

Aim of the study This work assessed the prevalence of self-medication with medicinal plants and the prevalence of the concomitant use of prescribed psychiatric drugs and medicinal plants for treating symptoms associated with anxiety and depression during the Covid-19 lockdown in Mexico. Materials and methods The suspected adverse reactions associated with drug-herb interactions were assessed. The factors associated with self-medication, the concomitant use of herb-drug combinations, and the presence of adverse reactions due their combined use is also reported. The study was descriptive and cross-sectional using an online questionnaire conducted among population with symptoms associated with anxiety and depression (n = 2100) from seven states of central-western Mexico. Results The prevalence of the use of herbs (61.9%) and the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations (25.3%) were associated with being diagnosed with mental illness [OR:2.195 (1.655–2.912)] and the use of psychiatric medications [OR:307.994 (178.609–531.107)], respectively. The presence of adverse reactions (n = 104) by the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations was associated with being unemployed [p = 0.004, OR: 3.017 (1.404–6.486)].

Purpose To investigate the experiences of undergraduate nursing students during their first uses of OL to increase the understanding of their encountered opportunities and challenges. Design A descriptive qualitative design guided by a phenomenological approach was used. Methods The study used a purposive sampling technique to recruit 18 undergraduate nursing students from two universities. Data were collected using two focus group discussions, and the discussions with participants were audio/video recorded through the online platform Zoom due to the national imposed curfew. Content analysis employed Colaizzi's steps to derive the themes/categories. Results The study revealed four themes: experience of helplessness, burdens, and burnout; the need for social and technical support to manage OL; the propensity to consider OL as a positive opportunity; and the deficiency of OL in fulfilling the educational outcomes of clinical courses. Conclusions Abrupt remote OL was a challenge to clinical encounters. This format was very stressful; however, it was also useful. The current study highlighted the need for further research on the effectiveness of remote OL platforms in regard to the achievement of the intended learning outcomes of clinical courses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104829,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104829,Scopus,10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104829,2021-05-01,,,
97,"Increased emotional eating during COVID-19 associated with lockdown, psychological and social distress","Due to the spread of COVID 2019, the Italian government imposed a lockdown on the national territory. Initially, citizens were required to stay at home and not to mix with others outside of their household (Phase 1); eventually, some of these restrictions were lifted (Phase 2). To investigate the impact of lockdown on emotional and binge eating, an online survey was conducted to compare measures of self-reported physical (BMI), psychological (Alexithymia), affective (anxiety, stress, and depression) and social (income, workload) state during Phase 1 and Phase 2. Data from 365 Italian residents showed that increased emotional eating was predicted by higher depression, anxiety, quality of personal relationships, and quality of life, while the increase of bingeing was predicted by higher stress. Moreover, we showed that higher alexithymia scores were associated by increased emotional eating and higher BMI scores were associated with both increased emotional eating and binge eating. Finally, we found that from Phase 1 to Phase 2 binge and emotional eating decreased. These data provide evidence of the negative effects of isolation and lockdown on emotional wellbeing, and, relatedly, on eating behaviour.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105122,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105122,Scopus,10.1016/j.appet.2021.105122,2021-05-01,,,
98,"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health among 157,213 Americans","Background The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented crisis with potential negative mental health impacts. Methods This study used data collected via Youper, a mental health app, from February through July 2020. Youper users (N = 157,213) in the United States self-reported positive and negative emotions and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. We examined emotions and symptoms before (pre), during (acute), and after (sustained) COVID-related stay-at-home orders. Results For changes in frequency of reported acute emotions, from the pre to acute periods, anxiety increased while tiredness, calmness, happiness, and optimism decreased. From the acute to sustained periods, sadness, depression, and gratitude increased. Anxiety, stress, and tiredness decreased. Between the pre and sustained periods, sadness and depression increased, as did happiness and calmness. Anxiety and stress decreased. Among symptom measures, anxiety increased initially, from the pre to the acute periods, but later returned to baseline. Limitations The study sample was primarily comprised of young people and women. The app does not collect racial or ethnicity data. These factors may limit generalizability. Sample size was also not consistent for all data collected. Conclusions The present study suggests that although there were initial negative impacts on emotions and mental health symptoms in the first few weeks, many Americans demonstrated resilience over the following months. The impact of the pandemic on mental health may not be as severe as predicted, although future work is necessary to understand longitudinal effects as the pandemic continues.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.056,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.056,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.056,2021-05-01,,,
99,Prior depression predicts greater stress during Covid-19 mandatory lockdown among college students in France,"Background The Covid-19 pandemic and its related public health measures such as mandatory lockdowns have been shown to have an impact on mental health. A key question is the role of pre-existing psychiatric disorders in how such measures are experienced. Methods During the first country-wide lockdown imposed in France, a Covid-19 module was added to the French portion of the ongoing World Mental Health International college student survey. The present study focuses on respondents who completed the survey during that time frame (n = 291). Results Students with prior depression endorsed greater increases in anxiety (72.2% vs 50.9%) and stress (72.2% vs 49.4%), as well as greater decreases in concentration (87.0% vs 72.9%) during lockdown as compared to those without depression history. In multivariate analyses, prior depression was associated with overall stress (AOR = 5.50), financial stress (AOR = 1.95), family stress (AOR = 2.47), work related stress (AOR = 5.15), and stress related to loved ones (AOR = 2.21). Prior depression was also associated with greater probability experiencing increased anxiety (AOR = 2.61) and stress (AOR = 2.55) during lockdown. Conclusions The findings indicate that the best predictor of experiencing stress and anxiety during the first Covid-19 lockdown was a history of depression prior to the pandemic outbreak. Implementing public health measures such as mandatory national lockdowns should be accompanied by strategies for reaching out to those who are vulnerable due to a history of mental illness.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152234,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152234,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152234,2021-05-01,,,
100,Factors affecting mental illness and social stress in hospital workers treating COVID-19: Paradoxical distress during pandemic era,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected all countries in the world. Hospital workers are at high risk of mental illness, such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, they also face many social stresses, such as deterioration of human relations and income reduction. Apart from mental illness, these social stresses can reduce motivation and lead to voluntary absenteeism, which contribute to a collapse of medical systems. Thus, for maintaining medical systems, it is crucial to clarify risk factors for both mental illness and increased social stress among hospital workers. However, little attention has been paid to factors affecting social stress, and thus, we aimed to address this gap. Methods In this cross-sectional survey of 588 hospital workers, the levels of anxiety, depression, and social stress were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Tokyo Metropolitan Distress Scale for Pandemic (TMDP). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify the demographic variables affecting these problems. Results Older age and female sex were common risk factors for anxiety, depression, and social stress. Moreover, occupational exposure to COVID-19 and hospital staff other than doctors/fewer non-work days were risk factors for increased anxiety and depression, respectively. Furthermore, living with families/others was a risk factor for increased social stress during this pandemic. Conclusion Our findings could be useful for developing policies and practices to minimize the risk of mental illness and increased social stress among hospital workers, highlighting that attention should be paid to social factors, such as an individual's household situation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.03.007,2021-05-01,,,
101,"Anxiety, depression and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a cross-sectional survey","Background Multiple survey studies have demonstrated a mental health (MH) burden of COVID-19 globally. However, few studies have examined relevant risk factors for pandemic-related MH issues. Methods A link to an online survey was posted from April 8th - June 11th, 2020 which included questions regarding COVID-19 experience, perceived impact of the pandemic on life domains (e.g., social communication, finances), behavioural alterations (e.g., online activities, substance use), and MH treatment history. Current psychiatric symptom severity and impairment were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Perceived Stress Scale. Results Overall, 632 individuals (82% female, mean age:42.04 ± 16.56) in Canada and the United States completed the survey. While few reported contracting COVID-19 (0.5%), the impact of the pandemic was evident, with a vast majority reporting anxiety around COVID-19 infecting loved ones (88%). Almost half (43%) reported previous MH treatment and 31% met criteria for GAD, 29% for MDD and 63% reported significantly high levels of stress. Female sex, younger age and past MH treatment emerged as significant predictors of these issues(p < .01). Age-related differences in the impact of COVID-19 on life domains, substance use, and online activity were also noted. Conclusion The findings from the current sample add to the growing literature suggesting negative effects of COVID-19 on MH, while highlighting specific risk factors.

102,Telemedicine increases access to buprenorphine initiation during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Federal regulatory changes during the COVID-19 pandemic allow buprenorphine to be prescribed without an initial in-person evaluation. Prior to COVID-19, numerous barriers limited broad uptake of buprenorphine among people who use drugs at the system, provider, and patient levels, including lack of available DATA 2000 waivered clinicians to prescribe, stigma, and competing livelihood priorities. As two harm reduction primary care programs in New York State that care for people who use drugs and offer buprenorphine, one rural (Ithaca) and one urban (Manhattan), we have rapidly adopted telemedicine to initiate buprenorphine treatment. Our collective experience suggests that telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation is eliminating many traditional barriers to treatment, in particular for individuals leaving incarceration, and people who use drugs and access syringe service programs. Future models of buprenorphine treatment should incorporate telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation, which can be done in collaboration with community-based outreach and peer networks to engage people who use drugs. This regulatory change must be sustained beyond COVID-19, and is vital to increasing access to buprenorphine, closing the opioid use disorder treatment gap, and achieving greater health equity for people who use drugs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108272,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108272,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108272,2021-05-01,,,
103,"Does peritraumatic distress predict PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms during and after COVID-19 lockdown in France? A prospective longitudinal study","Background COVID-19 peritraumatic distress (CPD), an emerging trauma-related psychopathology, involves immediate physiological arousal as well as emotional and cognitive responses to the threat of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study examined the prevalence of and temporal changes in CPD, its early and follow-up predictors and the extent to which it was predictive of mental health problems. Methods The study took a two-wave design approach and was conducted during and 3–4 months after the nationwide lockdown in France. Baseline participants were 1123 (79.5% women; M age = 33.82; range: 18–80). They completed validated measures assessing CPD, posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety symptoms. Descriptive, correlational, and path model analyses were used. Findings Both baseline and follow-up groups presented similar psychosocial profiles. Overall, 35.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 32.7–38.4) baseline participants and 17.2% (95% CI: 12.6–22.7) follow-up participants developed clinical cases of CPD. The baseline CPD levels predicted 14–20% of the variances of PTS (b = 0.55), depression (b = 0.16) and anxiety symptoms (b = 0.16). After accounting for the effect of the baseline CPD levels, the current CPD levels predicted the three investigated mental health outcomes in high proportions (43–47%). Further findings revealed important temporal changes in baseline predictors of CPD. However, the chronic CPD and PTS symptoms were prevalent among students and individuals developing worries about the COVID-19 crisis while depression and anxiety symptoms were prevalent among single people and those with pre-existing mental health problems. Limitations Data from self-report measures of mental health were used. The dropout rate between the two time assessments was relatively high. Conclusions These longitudinal findings call for clinical efforts in assessment of and intervention in trauma-related distress. These efforts should be put into the predictive role of CPD in subsequent development of PTS symptoms and comorbidities as long as the health, social and economic consequences of the pandemic linger.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.035,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.035,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.035,2021-05-01,,,
104,A predictable home environment may protect child mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective Information about the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent and adult mental health is growing, yet the impacts on preschool children are only emerging. Importantly, environmental factors that augment or protect from the multidimensional and stressful influences of the pandemic on emotional development of young children are poorly understood. Methods Depressive symptoms in 169 preschool children (mean age 4.1 years) were assessed with the Preschool Feelings Checklist during a state-wide stay-at-home order in Southern California. Mothers (46% Latinx) also reported on externalizing behaviors with the Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire. To assess the role of environmental factors in child mental health we examined household income, food insecurity, parental essential worker status and loss of parental job, as well as preservation of the structure of children's daily experiences with the Family Routines Inventory. Results Sixty-one percent of families' incomes were below the living wage and 50% had at least one parent who was an essential worker. Overall, preschoolers’ depressive and externalizing symptoms were elevated compared to pre-COVID norms. Practice of family routines robustly predicted better child mental health, and this protective effect persisted after covarying income, dual-parent status and food insecurity as well as maternal depression and stress. Conclusion The stress of the COVID-19 pandemic is exacting a significant toll on the mental health of preschool children. Importantly, maintaining a structured, predicable home environment by adherence to family routines appears to mitigate these adverse effects, providing empiric basis for public health recommendations.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100291,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100291,Scopus,10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100291,2021-05-01,,,

Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which result in worsening of their disability. There are concerns about the mental health of MS patients during this pandemic. Objective We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and levels of fear about Corona in MS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study on MS patients who were admitted to the MS clinics affiliated with Isfahan University of medical sciences from May to June 2020. Anxiety and depression were evaluated according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Corona Fear Questionnaire developed by Ahorsu et al. was applied to evaluate the state of fear about COVID-19. Chi-square tests were used to compare depression and anxiety between different groups, Kruskal-Wallis was used for fear scores, Spearman correlation coefficient was also reported for correlations. Results 410 MS patients with a mean age of 38.6 years (±10.35) were enrolled in the study. Among those patients who answered the HADS questionnaire completely (n=399, n=388, for anxiety and depression subscales respectively) the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 31.2% (n=128) and 39.3% (n=161), respectively. There was no significant relationship between anxiety and depression with any of the following variables: sex, marital status, history of drug abuse, smoking, duration of taking psychiatric medication, being tested for COVID-19, being quarantined. Regarding fear about COVID-19, patients with depression or anxiety showed higher scores on the fear questionnaire (p-value=0.03, p-value=0.008 respectively). Conclusions The prevalence of anxiety and depression in MS patients was higher than previously reported. Fear about COVID-19 was correlated with anxiety and depression.

106,Isoprostanes in wastewater as biomarkers of oxidative stress during COVID-19 pandemic,"Isoprostanes are the potential biomarkers of endogenous human metabolism and proven clinically to provide the quantitative measure of systematic oxidative injury. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analytical method capable of determining four biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-iso-PGF2α, 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III, PGE2, and 5-iPF2α-VI) in wastewater was developed and validated. Isoprostanes were quantified in the range of 31.1–1270 ng/L in raw wastewater samples in two communities in western Kentucky and Tennessee during the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent detection of PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI in wastewater suggested that PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI can be a reliable biomarker of community oxidative anxiety. The higher 4-month average mass load of isoprostanes [(ranged from 22.9 mg/d/1000 people to 807 mg/d/1000 people] may be attributed to the elevated community level oxidative anxiety owing COVID-19 uncertainties. The average mass loads of PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI in a community were significantly increased (two-tailed p < 0.001) from the first month of COVID-19 pandemic to the second month; however, significantly decreased (two-tailed p < 0.001) in the third month. Wastewater-based-epidemiological determination of isoprostanes can be a near-real-time and cost-effective approach of a trend in community depression. This is the first report of the quantification of PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI in wastewater and estimation of the community level oxidative anxiety.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129489,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129489,Scopus,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129489,2021-05-01,,,
107,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, access to care, and health disparities in the perinatal period","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health and created barriers to healthcare. In this study, we sought to elucidate the pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care for perinatal individuals. Methods This cross-sectional study of individuals in Massachusetts who were pregnant or up to three months postpartum with a history of depressive symptoms examined associations between demographics and psychiatric symptoms (via validated mental health screening instruments) and the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care. Chi-square associations and multivariate regression models were used. Results Of 163 participants, 80.8% perceived increased symptoms of depression and 88.8% of anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD at time of interview, higher education, and income were associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD were also associated with perceived changes in access to mental healthcare. Compared to non-Hispanic White participants, participants of color (Black, Asian, Multiracial, and/or Hispanic/Latinx) were more likely to report that the pandemic changed their mental healthcare access (aOR:3.25, 95%CI:1.23, 8.59). Limitations Limitations included study generalizability, given that participants have a history of depressive symptoms, and cross-sectional design. Conclusions The pandemic has increased symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety and impacted perceived access to care. Self-reported increases in depression and anxiety and changes to healthcare access varied by education, race/ethnicity, income, and positive screens. Understanding these differences is important to address perinatal mental health and provide equitable care.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.056,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.056,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.056,2021-05-01,,,
108,Mining topic and sentiment dynamics in physician rating websites during the early wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: Machine learning approach,"Introduction An increasing number of patients are voicing their opinions and expectations about the quality of care in online forums and on physician rating websites (PRWs). This paper analyzes patient online reviews (PORs) to identify emerging and fading topics and sentiment trends in PRWs during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods Text data were collected, including 55,612 PORs of 3430 doctors from three popular PRWs in the United States (RateMDs, HealthGrades, and Vitals) from March 01 to June 27, 2020. An improved latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling (topic coherence-based LDA [TCLDA]), manual annotation, and sentiment analysis tool were applied to extract a suitable number of topics, generate corresponding keywords, assign topic names, and determine trends in the extracted topics and specific emotions. Results According to the coherence value and manual annotation, the identified taxonomy includes 30 topics across high-rank and low-rank disease categories. The emerging topics in PRWs focus mainly on themes such as treatment experience, policy implementation regarding epidemic control measures, individuals’ attitudes toward the pandemic, and mental health across high-rank diseases. In contrast, the treatment process and experience during COVID-19, awareness and COVID-19 control measures, and COVID-19 deaths, fear, and stress were the most popular themes for low-rank diseases. Panic buying and daily life impact, treatment processes, and bedside manner were the fading themes across high-rank diseases. In contrast, provider attitude toward patients during the pandemic, detection at public transportation, passenger, travel bans and warnings, and materials supplies and society support during COVID-19 were the most fading themes across low-rank diseases. Regarding sentiment analysis, negative emotions (fear, anger, and sadness) prevail during the early wave of the COVID-19. Conclusion Mining topic dynamics and sentiment trends in PRWs may provide valuable knowledge of patients’ opinions during the COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers should consider these PORs and develop global healthcare policies and surveillance systems through monitoring PRWs. The findings of this study identify research gaps in the areas of e-health and text mining and offer future research directions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104434,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104434,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104434,2021-05-01,,,
109,Mental health of Health Care Workers (HCWs): a review of organizational interventions put in place by local institutions to cope with new psychosocial challenges resulting from COVID-19,"The COVID-19 outbreak has been associated with significant occupational stressors and challenges for healthcare workers (HCWs) including the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Many reports from all over the world have already found that HCWs have significant levels of self-reported anxiety, depression and even symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Therefore, supporting mental health of HCWs is a crucial part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present review is to ascertain the interventions put in place worldwide in reducing stress in HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak. We evidenced how only few countries have published specific psychological support intervention protocols for HCWs. All programs were developed in university associated hospitals and highlighted the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration. All of them had as their purpose to manage the psychosocial challenges to HCW's during the pandemic in order to prevent mental health problems.Whether one program offers distinct benefit compared to the others cannot be known given the heterogeneity of the protocols and the lack of a rigorous protocol and clinical outcomes. Further research is crucial to find out the best ways to support the resilience and mental well-being of HCWs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113847,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113847,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113847,2021-05-01,,,
110,"Basketball jones: Fan passion, motives, and reactions to the suspension of the National Basketball Association season due to COVID-19","The suspension of the 2019–2020 National Basketball Association (NBA) season due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that NBA fans were unable to engage in an activity that they loved in the midst of a global health crisis. In this research, we assessed if fan responses to the suspension were associated with different types of fan passion and motives. Shortly after the NBA season suspension, NBA fans (N = 395) completed online surveys assessing harmonious and obsessive passion for being an NBA fan, motives for watching games, and various attitudes and responses to the suspension. We found that both fan passion and motives predicted responses to the suspension, particularly obsessive passion which predicted greater levels of distress, coping responses, and negative attitudes toward the suspension. These findings have implications for both the passion and fan motives literatures.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101885,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101885,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101885,2021-05-01,,,
111,A potential solution to avoid overdose of mixed drugs in the event of Covid-19: Nanomedicine at the heart of the Covid-19 pandemic,"Since 2020, the world is facing the first global pandemic of 21st century. Among all the solutions proposed to treat this new strain of coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, the vaccine seems a promising way but the delays are too long to be implemented quickly. In the emergency, a dual therapy has shown its effectiveness but has also provoked a set of debates around the dangerousness of a particular molecule, hydroxychloroquine. In particular, the doses to be delivered, according to the studies, were well beyond the acceptable doses to support the treatment without side effects. We propose here to use all the advantages of nanovectorization to address this question of concentration. Using quantum and classical simulations we will show in particular that drug transport on boron nitrogen oxide nanosheets increases the effectiveness of the action of these drugs. This will definitely allow to decrease the drug quantity needing to face the disease.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2021.107834,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2021.107834,Scopus,10.1016/j.jmgm.2021.107834,2021-05-01,,,
112,Meaning making helps cope with COVID-19: A longitudinal study,"Meaning making is a useful coping strategy in negative situations. We investigated whether making meaning in negative experiences (MINE) would help people cope with COVID-19. We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study (N = 2364) three months before, during, and after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Results showed that participants reported increased tendency of MINE during the COVID-19 outbreak than three months before the outbreak. Moreover, both initial MINE and the increased MINE predicted less psychological distress including depression, anxiety and stress, during and three months after the outbreak. Perceived benefits and costs of the COVID-19 mediated the long-term effect of MINE. These findings not only provide novel evidence for meaning making model but also shed light on the underlying mechanism, suggesting an effective strategy to cope with stressful events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110670,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110670,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2021.110670,2021-05-01,,,
113,Psychiatric impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic on U.S. sexual and gender minority young adults,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented isolation and mental health effects; few studies have characterized this in sexual and gender (SGM) minority young people, a particularly vulnerable population. This cross-sectional study sought to analyze the mental health outcomes of SGM young people (18-30 years) during the early stages of the pandemic in the United States (April 13-June 18, 2020) and to explore how factors related to SGM identity impact mental health, such as lifetime discrimination, family support, and pre-existing mental health conditions. An online survey collected socio-demographic information and assessed for both mental health (depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), PTSD (PCL-C)) and COVID-19-related outcomes (COVID-19-related worries and COVID-19-related grief). Out of 981 participants, 320 (32.6%) identified as SGM. SGM had significantly higher levels of depression and PTSD symptoms as well as COVID-19-related worries and grief than non-SGM, even after controlling for family support, lifetime discrimination, and pre-existing mental health diagnoses. These findings suggest that not only has the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted SGM mental health, but that minority stress factors cannot fully explain this impact. Thus, clinicians and societal stakeholders (schools, employers, policymakers) must think beyond traditional minority stress factors (family support, discrimination) and pre-pandemic disparities to support this vulnerable population as the pandemic progresses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113855,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113855,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113855,2021-05-01,,,
114,Using telehealth to improve buprenorphine access during and after COVID-19: A rapid response initiative in Rhode Island,"Despite its proven efficacy, buprenorphine remains dramatically underutilized for management of opioid use disorder largely due to onerous barriers to treatment initiation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many substance use disorder treatment facilities have reduced their hours and services, exacerbating existing barriers. To this end, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration adjusted their guidelines to allow for new buprenorphine prescriptions following audio-only telehealth encounters, no longer requiring an in-person evaluation prior to treatment initiation. Under this new guidance, we established a 24/7 telephone hotline to function as a “tele-bridge” clinic where people with opioid use disorder can be linked with a buprenorphine prescriber in real-time for OUD assessment and unobserved buprenorphine initiation with connection to follow-up if appropriate. Additionally, we developed an ED callback protocol to reach patients recently seen for opioid overdose and facilitate their entry into care if interested. In this commentary we describe our hotline and ED callback protocols, discuss theoretical and anecdotal benefits to this approach, and advocate for continuation of current regulatory changes post-COVID-19 to maintain expanded access to novel treatment approaches.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108283,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108283,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108283,2021-05-01,,,
115,Substance use treatment in Appalachian Tennessee amid COVID-19: Challenges and preparing for the future,"The COVID-19 pandemic created a number of rapidly emerging and unprecedented challenges for those engaged in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, forcing service providers to improvise their treatment strategies as the crisis deepened. Drawing from five ongoing federally funded SUD projects in Appalachian Tennessee and hundreds of hours of meetings and interviews, this article explores the pandemic's impact on an already structurally disadvantaged region, its recovery community, and those who serve it. More specifically, we note detrimental effects of increased isolation since the implementation of COVID-19 safety measures, including stakeholders' reports of higher incidences of relapse, overdose, and deaths in the SUD population. Treatment providers have responded with telehealth services, but faced barriers in technology access and computer literacy among clients. Providers have also had to restrict new clients to accommodate social distancing, faced delays in health screening those they can accept, and denied family visitations, which has affected retention. In light of these challenges, several promising lessons for the future emerged––such as preparing for an influx of new and returning clients in need of SUD treatment; making arrangements for long-term housing and facility modification; developing a hybrid care delivery model, taking advantage of new regulations enabling telemedicine; budgeting for and storing personal protective equipment (PPE) and related supplies; and developing disaster protocols to withstand threats to intake, retention, and financial solvency.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108270,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108270,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108270,2021-05-01,,,
116,Coping strategies in obsessive-compulsive patients during Covid-19 lockdown,"Background/Objective The main aim of this study was to compare coping strategies in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients and a healthy control group during COVID-19 lockdown and to analyze the relationship with some variables which may influence results (depression, anxiety, comorbidity, subtype of obsession-compulsion). Method: There were 237 participants, 122 OCD and 115 healthy controls, aged 17-61 years old (M = 33.48, SD = 11.13). Results: Groups showed differences in the use of some adaptive strategies (positive reinterpretation, acceptance, humor) and maladaptive (denial, self-blame). Within obsessive-compulsive group, comorbidity affected the greater use of inappropriate strategies (denial, substance abuse and self-blame) while type of obsession-compulsion did not influence use. Anxiety and depression levels were related to the use of less adaptive strategies. Conclusions: These findings strengthen the need for training in the use of effective and adaptive coping strategies, making it necessary to improve clinical follow-up of these patients. It is relevant to be in contact with healthcare professionals, review medication and observe the anxiety and depression levels.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2021.100223,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2021.100223,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijchp.2021.100223,2021-05-01,,,
117,"Association of Symptoms of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity with Problematic Internet Use among University Students in Wuhan, China During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background COVID-19 is still spreading worldwide and posing a threat to individuals’ physical and mental health including problematic internet use (PIU). A potentially high-risk group for PIU are those with symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD symptoms), because of restrictions in their physical activity levels and engagement in computer diversions requiring only short attention spans. Methods We used convenience sampling in a cross-sectional survey of university students from 30 universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. We assessed PIU using the Internet Addiction Test and ADHD symptoms using the WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale. Using logistic regression and linear regression analyses we adjusted for demographic, epidemic-related and psychological covariates in models of the association between ADHD symptoms and PIU. Results Among 11,254 participants, we found a 28.4% (95% CI, 27.5%-29.2%) prevalence of PIU, relatively higher than before the pandemic. In our final logistic regression model, participants with ADHD symptoms had approximately two times the risk for PIU (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.89-2.83). Similarly, individuals with depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD symptoms and feeling stress during the pandemic had a higher risk of PIU, while those exercising regularly during the pandemic had a lower risk. Limitations The cross-sectional design and reliance on internet based self-reports for ADHD symptoms and PIU assessments, without direct structured interviews for validation, are limitations. Conclusions The prevalence of PIU was high during COVID-19, and those people with ADHD symptoms and other mental illness symptoms appear to be at higher risk of PIU. Regular exercise may reduce that PIU risk and hence should be recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.078,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.078,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.078,2021-05-01,,,
118,Clinician perspectives on methadone service delivery and the use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study,"Objectives During the COVID-19 pandemic, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) in the U.S. were granted new flexibility in methadone dispensing and the use of telemedicine. To explore the impact of the pandemic and accompanying policy changes on service delivery, we asked OTP clinicians about changes in care patterns and perceptions of impacts on access and quality. Methods In May–June 2020, we completed semistructured telephone interviews with 20 OTP clinicians (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) from 13 U.S. states. The study recruited participants through Medscape, an online platform where clinicians access clinical content. We used rapid thematic analysis, a qualitative approach, to summarize participants' expressed views related to the research objectives. Results Clinicians identified a range of changes to methadone and ancillary service delivery as a result of COVID-19. Most clinicians reported that OTPs were prescribing more take-home doses of methadone and providing psychosocial services and medication management via telemedicine. Many also reported reducing the frequency of urine toxicology screening and accepting fewer new patients. While some clinicians expressed support for the increased flexibility around dosing and use of telemedicine, others expressed concern about increased risk of medication diversion and overdose. Clinicians reported several advantages and disadvantages of the changes due to the pandemic and that continued reimbursement would be required to maintain telemedicine services. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered the delivery of methadone treatment in the U.S. This study's findings suggest that OTPs may have reduced their methadone treatment during the early months of the pandemic and that the flexibilities that policy changes offered may not have resulted in changes in care delivery for all patients. Careful consideration and additional analysis should inform which changes OTPs should maintain long-term.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108288,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108288,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108288,2021-05-01,,,
119,Predictors of mental health among parents of children with cerebral palsy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran: A web-based cross-sectional study,"Background Caring for children with cerebral palsy (CP) for many aspects of their lives may affect caregiver’s psychological health. Emergence of COVID-19 put added pressure on caregivers. Aims The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological health of Iranian caregivers of children with CP and associated risks during a lockdown period. Methods Using online snowball sampling, 160 caregivers of children with CP participated in this web-based cross-sectional study. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), Caregiver Difficulties Scale (CDS), and a demographic questionnaire were administered. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was applied to identify risk factors related to caregiver psychological health. Outcomes and results Mental health problems were prevalent; (depression = 45.0% and anxiety = 40.6%). Significant correlations were found between CDS and HADS-Anxiety (r = 0.472, P < 0.001), HADS-depression (r = 0.513, P < 0.001), and perceived stress (PSS) related to COVID-19 (r = 0.425, P < 0.001). After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, burden (CDS) was found to significantly predict caregiver anxiety, depression and stress. Furthermore, several demographic characteristics (being married, low educational level and low income) were significantly related to high HADS Anxiety scores. For depression, only having a physical problem was significantly related to HADS among demographic variables. No significant correlations were found between PSS-4 and demographic variables. Conclusions and implications During COVID-19 outbreak, the mental health of caregivers of children with CP is affected by multiple factors such as burden of care and demographic characteristics. Due to the importance of well-being among caregivers of disabled children, a comprehensive plan including psychological consultation, remote education, or in-person handouts for the self-care or handling of the children and adequate distance support may enable better mental health for these caregivers.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103890,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103890,Scopus,10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103890,2021-05-01,,,
120,Addressing the critical need for long-term mental health data during the COVID-19 pandemic: Changes in mental health from April to September 2020,"Despite the large amounts of research currently being conducted and the high number of editorials warning about the potential mental health impacts, there is a stunning lack of longitudinal mental health data on the effects of the pandemic. Yet, the pandemic may have sizable long-term impacts on psychological distress and health behaviors—these effects may be long-lasting and may disproportionately affect some demographic groups more than others. Data came from a longitudinal international study of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults' psychological distress and wellbeing (N = 1567). We found high rates of depression (55% were diagnosable with probable depression at baseline), anxiety (65%), and risk for PTSD (51%). More than one-third of participants who reported that they drank alcohol indicated that their drinking had increased since the start of the pandemic. Over time, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased significantly, but acute stress symptoms decreased. Specific demographic groups (people of color and sexual and gender minorities) appeared to be at high risk of distress across analyses. Our findings suggest high rates of depression, anxiety, acute stress, and other signs of distress like isolation, hopelessness, and use of substances to cope—even at five-month follow-up. Our findings suggest a need to prioritize availability of, and access to, mental health care during both the pandemic and the recovery.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106465,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106465,Scopus,10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106465,2021-05-01,,,

The main objective of this research is to study the psychological impact of the lockdown due to the social emergency situation (COVID-19) in children/adolescents and adults diagnosed with ASD. Participants were 37 caregivers of children/adolescents with ASD, also 35 ASD adults and 32 informants. Evaluation was conducted through a web survey system and included standardized clinical questionnaires (CBCL and SCL-90-R), which were compared with results before lockdown start, and a brief self-reported survey addressing the subjective perception of changes in daily functioning areas. The results revealed a reduction of psychopathological symptoms in both age groups, but only reaching statistical significance in the adult group, except for Somatization, Anxiety, and Obsessive-Compulsive domains. ASD severity Level 2 showed greater improvement after lockdown onset in the children/adolescent group when compared to ASD Level 1 participants. Younger adults (18–25 yoa) reported greater improvement than older adults (=>25 yoa). Survey results indicate an improvement of feeding quality and a reduction in the number of social initiations during the lockdown. Adult ASD participants perceived a decrease in stress levels after the lockdown onset, whereas caregivers reported higher stress levels at the same point in both age groups. Limitations included the small number of participants and a heterogeneous evaluation window between measures.

122,Pandemic dreams: quantitative and qualitative features of the oneiric activity during the lockdown due to COVID-19 in Italy,"Objective The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on daily habits, emotional experience, mental health and sleep. A large body of evidence suggests that dreams are affected by both waking experiences and sleep pattern. In this view, the lockdown should have induced intense modifications in dreaming activity. The aim of the study was to assess dream features during the lockdown in Italy. Methods We used an online survey to collect self-reported demographic, clinical, sleep and dream data. Our sample included 1091 participants. Results Results point to an increased dream frequency, emotional load, vividness, bizarreness and length during the lockdown, compared to a pre-lockdown period. Higher dream frequency and specific qualitative features were found in females and subjects with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviours and depressive symptoms. Most of the dream features assessed during the lockdown were predicted by age, gender, depressive symptoms, presence/absence of other people at home, and territorial area. A specific focus on sleep features revealed that sleep duration and several sleep quality indexes were the best predictors of dream variables. During the lockdown, dreams were also characterized by increased negative emotions, which were particularly frequent in females, younger adults, and participants with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviours, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conclusions Our results confirm the hypothesis of a strong influence of the pandemic on dreaming, supporting both the hypothesis of continuity between wake and sleep mental processes and the view of a crucial influence of sleep quality and duration on dreaming activity.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.006,2021-05-01,,,

This crisis resulted in an almost two-month lockdown in France — lockdown that has serious impacts on physical and mental health. This unprecedented situation resulted in an important reflection about the mental health of the persons experiencing this crisis. The aim of our study was to apprehend the emotional state of the persons experiencing this lockdown, taking into account day-to-day life and feelings of loneliness. In order to develop a good comprehension of the impact of this situation on mental health, we recruited 4689 persons through an online survey between March 17th and May 11th of 2020 in France. We used several psychometric tools that gave us access to various data, such as socio-biographical information, situational variables — place of living, work context, etc. — and psychological state — depressive symptoms, anxiety, loneliness, etc. This paper focuses mostly on the UCLA loneliness scale, and the French Canadian version of the Psychiatric Symptoms Index (PSI), which measures psychological distress, as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Results show a moderate psychological distress for 27.5% of our sample, with depressive symptomatology, irritability or cognitive impairment. There is also a high loneliness feeling in 21.8% of the sample. Psychological distress is explained by sociodemographic variables — such as gender and age — but also by situational information — type of housing and persistence of income — and the loneliness feeling. If this pandemic and this lockdown show a clear impact on the emotional life of the French population, these results need to be taken into account with a broader range of situational and psychological variables. These additional data would help us have a more thorough understanding of the underlying factors explaining this difficult experience of the crisis. This comprehension also needs to go further in time and think about the repercussions beyond the end of the lockdown, in order to observe the evolution of these emotions and the potential persistence of psychological distress.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejtd.2020.100189,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejtd.2020.100189,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejtd.2020.100189,2021-05-01,,,
124,Temporal association of contamination obsession on the prehospital delay of STEMI during COVID-19 pandemic,"Background One of the modifiable risk factors for ST elevation myocardial infarction is prehospital delay. The purpose of our study was to look at the effect of contamination contamination obsession on prehospital delay compared with other measurements during the Covid-19 pandemic. Method A total of 139 patients with acute STEMI admitted to our heart center from 20 March 2020 to 20 June 2020 were included in this study. If the time interval between the estimated onset of symptoms and admission to the emergency room was >120 min, it was considered as a prehospital delay. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Padua Inventory-Washington State University Revision (PI-WSUR) test were used to assess Contamination-Obbsessive compulsive disorder (C-OCD). Result The same period STEMI count compared to the previous year decreased 25%. The duration of symptoms onset to hospital admission was longer in the first month compared to second and third months (180 (120–360), 120 (60–180), and 105 (60–180), respectively; P = 0.012). Multivariable logistic regression (model-2) was used to examine the association between 7 candidate predictors (age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, smoking, pain-onset time, and coronary artery disease (CAD) history), PI-WSUR C-OCD, and admission month with prehospital delay. Among variables, PI-WSUR C-OCD and admission month were independently associated with prehospital delay (OR 5.36 (2.11–13.61) (P = 0.01); 0.26 (0.09–0.87) p < 0.001] respectively]. Conclusion Our study confirmed that contamination obsession was associated with prehospital delay of STEMI patients, however anxiety and depression level was not associated during the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.01.083,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.01.083,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajem.2021.01.083,2021-05-01,,,
125,Characterization and impact assessment of super cyclonic storm AMPHAN in the Indian subcontinent through space borne observations,"Tropical cyclones can cause extensive damage in coastal regions as a result of high winds, storm tide, and intense rainfall. The West Bengal state in India was severely affected by a recent cyclonic storm 'Amphan' a 'super cyclone'with a high wind speed of above 220 km/h. The present study aimed to assess the impact of the cyclone Amphan in the potential impact zone covering the two states of India (Odisha and West Bengal) and the west coast of Bangladesh. The present study analyzed the land use land cover, rainfall variability, and potential storm surge along the cyclone track to assess the possible impact on the coastal landscape as well as community. The cyclone Amphan was formed in the Northern Indian Ocean near Equatorial Easterly wave over south Andaman Sea and adjoiningsoutheast Bay of Bengal (BoB) at 10° N 87° E on 16 May 2020 as deep depression and moved toward the north direction and had land fall at the coast of West Bengal on 20 May 2020 as an extremely severe cyclonic storm with the wind speed 155 km/h and central pressure of 960hpa.The cyclone devastated the coastal districts of West Bengal due to the high intensity of precipitation along with the extreme storm surge. About 100 people lost their lives and ~20 million people severely affected in West Bengal alone. Within the West Bengal state, around 7877 sq km area was observed under the potential storm surge zone. Cropland was observed as the most surge affected land cover with 5191 sq km area (65.9%), followed by wetlands (1635.2 sq km (20.75%) along with 38.34 sq km (0.48%)) of built up land under the potential surge impact zone The cyclone more severely affected the west Medinapur and South 24 Parganas, which were also the most affected by COVID-19 which resulted in slow evacuation, delay in medical support and concomitant increase in loss of life.

126,"Are biased interpretations of ambiguous social and non-social situations a precursor, consequence or maintenance factor of youth loneliness?","Loneliness is common in youth, with suggestions that these negative emotions confer vulnerability for anxiety and depression. Here, we investigated for the first time whether, consistent with psychological models of loneliness, biased interpretations of social situations could prospectively predict loneliness in youth. 104 young people completed measures of loneliness and interpretations of ambiguous social and non-social (bodily or health-related) situations at three time-points with intervals of three months between each. As government-imposed social distancing measures (to control the COVID-19 outbreak) occurred between Times 2 and 3 (but not between Times 1 and 2), this enabled us to assess whether restricted social activity could provoke greater predictive power of biased interpretational styles on loneliness. Using cross-lagged panel models, we showed that after estimating paths representing within-time across-variable (“concurrent”) paths and across-time within-variable (“stability”) paths, there were no significant cross-lag ‘causal’ paths between earlier interpretational style and later loneliness. Between Time 2 and 3, we demonstrated a significant cross-lag ‘consequential’ path between earlier loneliness and later threatening interpretations of social situations, but this became non-significant after controlling for concurrent anxiety and depression. Biased interpretational style may reflect a concurrent maintenance factor of youth loneliness.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2021.103829,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2021.103829,Scopus,10.1016/j.brat.2021.103829,2021-05-01,,,
127,Fever range whole body hyperthermia for re-irradiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: Final results of a prospective study,"Objectives Fever-range whole body hyperthermia (FRWBH) has been shown to improve tumor oxygenation in vivo. A prospective pilot study addressed the question if addition of FRWBH to re-irradiation is feasible in recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with unfavorable prognostic features. Materials and methods The study completed accrual with the recruitment of ten patients between April 2018 and March 2020. Re-irradiation was administered using volumetric arc hyperfractionated radiotherapy with bi-daily 1.2 Gray (Gy) single fractions and a total dose of 66 Gy to all macroscopic tumor lesions. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted mostly of cisplatin (7 patients). FRWBH was scheduled weekly during re-irradiation. The study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (NCT03547388). Results Only five patients received all cycles of FRWBH. Poor patient compliance, active infections during treatment and study restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic were the main reasons for omitting FRWBH. No increase of acute toxicity was observed by FRWBH. Exploratory evaluation of outcome data suggests that FRWBH treatment according to protocol does not seem to have a detrimental effect on tumor control or survival and might even increase treatment efficacy. Conclusion FRWBH is difficult to apply concomitant to re-irradiation in HNSCC. No excess toxicity was observed in patients receiving FRWBH and exploratory analyses suggest potential anti-tumor activity and decreased patient-reported depression scores after FRWBH.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105240,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105240,Scopus,10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105240,2021-05-01,,,
128,Mental health consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak in Spain. A longitudinal study of the alarm situation and return to the new normality,"Aims The objective is to conduct a longitudinal analysis of the effects of the pandemic and alarm situation on the mental health of the general population at three points in time: two weeks after beginning the confinement, after a month, and after two months, when the lockdown was lifted and the country returned to the new normality. Methods The evaluations were carried out by means of an online survey, with a sample of 3480 persons in the first data collection and 1041 and 569 persons in the successive evaluation periods. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, Covid-19 variables, loneliness, psychological well-being, social support, discrimination and a sense of belonging, were collected. Results Depressive symptoms increased significantly throughout the confinement, decreasing at the last assessment but not dropping to previous levels. In anxiety, there are no significant changes between the three evaluations, but a downward trend can be seen over time. Regarding the symptomatology of PTSD, a downward trend is observed throughout the three evaluations, with significantly lower scores between the first and third assessments. The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD. Conclusions This research shows that the pandemic has had a negative impact on our mental health, which still does not seem to be at pre-crisis levels, although it has improved as the emergency situation subsides. These results underline the importance of paying greater attention to mental health, and reveal key variables such as spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness in which to intervene from different care services, as well as younger people and women as vulnerable groups on which to focus more attention.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110219,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110219,Scopus,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110219,2021-04-20,,,
129,The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: An umbrella review of meta-analyses,"Background Healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, are particularly susceptible to physical and mental health consequences such as anxiety and depression. The aim of this umbrella review of meta-analyses is to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using relevant keywords, data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase were searched to obtain systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of January to the end of October 2020. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess heterogeneity among studies. Data was analyzed using STATA 14 software. Results In the primary search, 103 studies were identified, and ultimately 7 studies were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83–28.05, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41–28.25, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively.

130,The impact of COVID-19 lockdown and of the following “re-opening” period on specific and general psychopathology in people with Eating Disorders: the emergent role of internalizing symptoms,"Background We assessed the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on specific Eating Disorder (ED) and general psychopathology in people with an ED diagnosis during the lockdown period and after the end of the related containment measures. Methods People with clinically defined diagnosis and undergoing treatment for an ED completed an online survey, which included adapted questions from standardized psychometric scales. Data relative to three different time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were collected. Psychopathological changes over these periods were investigated and compared through one-way analysis of variance or covariance with repeated measures. Results Three hundred twelve people completed the survey (57.4% diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or atypical AN, 20.2% with Bulimia Nervosa, 15.4% with Binge Eating Disorder, 7.05% with Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders). The severity of both specific and general psychopathology increased during the lockdown and the rise of general symptoms persisted in the following re-opening phase, except for suicide ideation. Almost all of these findings were not affected by ED diagnosis, participants’ age and illness duration. Limitations The retrospective nature of data collection is the main limitation of the study. Conclusions People with EDs showed a COVID-19 emergency-induced worsening of both general and specific psychopathology. The effect on general psychopathology persisted in the re-opening period. These findings suggest a high stress vulnerability of ED individuals with important effects on internalizing symptoms, which are worth of attention by clinicians.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.037,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.037,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.037,2021-04-15,,,
131,Examining temporal interactions between loneliness and depressive symptoms and the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties among UK residents during the COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal results from the COVID-19 psychological wellbeing study,"Background Longitudinal studies examining the temporal association between mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak are needed. It is important to determine how relationships between key outcomes, specifically loneliness and depressive symptoms, manifest over a brief timeframe and in a pandemic context. Method Data was gathered over 4 months (March – June 2020) using an online survey with three repeated measures at monthly intervals (N = 1958; 69.8% females; Age 18-87 years, M = 37.01, SD = 12.81). Associations between loneliness, depression symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulty were tested using Pearson's product moment correlations, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all study variables. Cross-lagged structural equation modelling was used to examine the temporal relationships between variables. Results The longitudinal association between loneliness and depressive symptoms was reciprocal. Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms one month later, and depressive symptoms predicted higher loneliness one month later. The relationship was not mediated by emotion regulation difficulties. Emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms were also reciprocally related over time. Limitations Limitations include the reliance on self-report data and the non-representative sample. There was no pre-pandemic assessment limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Conclusions Loneliness should be considered an important feature of case conceptualisation for depression during this time. Clinical efforts to improve mental health during the pandemic could focus on interventions that target either loneliness, depression, or both.

Design Observational, cross-sectional. Methods An online survey was disseminated to adults (n=8,425; 44.5±14.8y) residing in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia within the first 2-6 weeks of government-mandated COVID-19 restrictions. Main outcome measures included: Stages of Change scale for exercise behaviour change; International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short-form); World Health Organisation-5 Well-being Index; and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-9. Results Participants who reported a negative change in exercise behaviour from before initial COVID-19 restrictions to during the initial COVID-19 restrictions demonstrated poorer mental health and well-being compared to those demonstrating either a positive-or no change in their exercise behaviour (p <0.001). Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p <0.001). Individuals who had more positive exercise behaviours reported better mental health and well-being (p <0.001). Although there were no differences in PA between countries, individuals in New Zealand reported better mental health and well-being (p <0.001). Conclusion The initial COVID-19 restrictions have differentially impacted upon PA habits of individuals based upon their age and sex, and therefore have important implications for international policy and guideline recommendations. Public health interventions that encourage PA should target specific groups (e.g., men, young adults) who are most vulnerable to the negative effects of physical distancing and/or self-isolation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2020.11.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2020.11.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsams.2020.11.016,2021-04-01,,,
139,Effects of centralized isolation vs. home isolation on psychological distress in patients with COVID-19,"Objective This study aimed to evaluate the impact of isolation form on the recovery of psychological distress in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after being discharged from hospital. Methods Baseline survey was conducted from February 10, 2020 to February 25, 2020 in patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital on the discharge day. After discharge, patients were free to choose whether isolate in a centralized isolation site (i.e. designated hotel) or their own home for another two weeks. A follow-up survey was conducted at the end of the 2-week post-discharge isolation. Depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health were assessed at both time points using the 9-item patient health questionnaire, 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale and self-rated health scores, respectively. Results Fifty centrally isolated and 45 home isolated patients completed both the baseline and the follow-up assessments. Significant effects of time and time by isolation form were found on depression and anxiety levels, with a significant decrease in depression and anxiety shown in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. Besides, a significant time effect was identified on self-rated health with significant improvement found in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. Conclusions Home isolation is superior to centralized isolation in the recovery of COVID-19-associated depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health. More attention needs to be paid to the psychological well-being of centrally isolated patients. A sustained and integrated rehabilitation plan is warranted for patients with COVID-19 to achieve both physical and psychological recovery.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110365,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110365,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110365,2021-04-01,,,

143,"Longitudinal changes of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: The role of pre-existing anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders","Especially individuals with mental disorders might experience an escalation of psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the role of anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders for levels and longitudinal changes of COVID-19-related fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. In a longitudinal observational design with four assessment waves from March, 27th until June, 15th 2020, a total of 6,551 adults from Germany was assessed. 4,175 individuals participated in one, 1,070 in two, 803 in three, and 503 in all four waves of data collection. Multilevel analyses revealed that across all assessment waves, COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in individuals with vs. without anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders. All symptoms decreased on average over time, and this decrease was significantly stronger in individuals with vs. without anxiety disorders, and particularly driven by individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. Our findings suggest that individuals with mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders – and in particular those with a generalized anxiety disorder – seem to be vulnerable to experience psychological strain in the context of the pandemic, might likely overestimate potential threat, and should be targeted by preventive and therapeutic interventions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102377,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102377,Scopus,10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102377,2021-04-01,,,
144,Psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 lockdown: A two-wave network analysis,"Background Although preliminary research has evidenced negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population, little research has been carried out examining the interplay among the broader dimensions and correlates of individual distress. Via network analysis, the current study investigated the pathways that underlie some components of psychological distress and their changes over time (during and post COVID-19-related lockdown). Methods 1,129 adult participants (79.1% women) completed a two-wave online survey during and after the lockdown, and reported on variables such as depression, anxiety, stress, fear of COVID, intolerance of uncertainty, emotion regulation and social support. The networks were estimated via Gaussian Graphical Models and their temporal changes were compared through the centrality measures. Results Depression, stress, anxiety and fear of COVID formed a spatially contiguous pattern, which remained unchanged in both the two waves. After the lockdown, the fear of COVID node reduced its strength in the network, whereas inhibitory intolerance of uncertainty and emotion suppression were associated with depression. Emotion regulation was connected to depression, but not to stress and anxiety during both waves. Perceived emotional support had few connections to the other nodes. Limitations Only 32.7% of participants provided complete responses for both waves. Conclusion The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on adults. In the context of the network approach, depressive symptoms had the highest strength and their associations to other dimensions of individual distress may be key factors in understanding the influence of exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.016,2021-04-01,,,
145,Update of takotsubo syndrome in the era of COVID-19,"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has become a well-known disease not only in Japan but also in the rest of the world. Early reports suggested that TTS is a self-limiting disease with better prognosis than acute coronary syndrome. However, recent data showed that TTS is not a benign disease as compared with acute coronary syndrome. In addition to the apical ballooning, several other types of wall motion abnormalities have been classified as variants of TTS. In particular, right ventricular involvement, or biventricular TTS, is not uncommon and is associated with poor in-hospital as well as long-term outcomes. With respect to the pathophysiology, modulation (desensitization) of the beta-adrenergic receptor is suspected as a possible mechanism for transiently depressed myocardial contraction. Although specific treatments to improve prognosis of TTS are still uncertain, observational data suggest favorable impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Finally, in the era of COVID-19, we should pay attention to a variety of cardiovascular conditions related to COVID-19. TTS is one of these conditions that can be triggered by both emotional and physical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2020.10.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2020.10.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.jjcc.2020.10.004,2021-04-01,,,

We developed an online tool to identify prospective predictors of PTSD and depressive symptoms in the context of co-occurring social unrest and COVID-19 in Hong Kong. 150 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments, with a median duration of 29 days. Three logistic regression models were constructed to assess its discriminative power in predicting PTSD and depressive symptoms at one month. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed for each model to determine their optimal decision thresholds. Sensitivity and specificity of the models were 87.1% and 53.8% for probable PTSD, 77.5% and 63.3% for high-risk depressive symptoms, and 44.7% and 96.4% for no significant depressive symptoms. The models performed well in discriminating outcomes (AUCs range: 0.769–0.811). Probable PTSD was predicted by social unrest-related traumatic events, high rumination, and low resilience. Rumination and resilience also predicted high-risk and no significant depressive symptoms, with COVID-19-related events also predicting no significant depression risk. Accessible screening of probable mental health outcomes with good predictive capability may be important for early intervention opportunities.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113773,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113773,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113773,2021-04-01,,,
147,Increases in distress during stay-at-home mandates During the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has contributed to over 500,000 deaths, and hospitalization of thousands of individuals worldwide. Cross-sectional data indicate that anxiety and depression levels are greater during the pandemic, yet no known prospective studies have tested this assertion. Further, individuals with elevated trait anxiety prior to a global pandemic may theoretically be more apt to experience greater pandemic-related anxiety and/or impairment. The current study tested whether anxiety and depression increased from the month before the state's Stay-At-Home order to the period of the Stay-At-Home order among 120 young adults in Louisiana, a state with especially high rates of COVID-19 related infections and deaths. We also tested whether pre-pandemic social anxiety was related to greater pandemic related anxiety, depression, and COVID-related worry and impairment. Depression but not anxiety increased during the Stay-At-Home order. Further, pre-pandemic trait anxiety, social anxiety, and depression were statistically significant predictors of anxiety and depression during the Stay-At-Home order, although only social anxiety was robustly related to COVID-related worry and impairment. Emotional distress increased during the COVID-19 pandemic Stay-At-Home order and this is especially the case among individuals with pre-pandemic elevations in trait anxiety (especially social anxiety) and depression.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113821,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113821,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113821,2021-04-01,,,
148,Art therapy drawing protocols for chronic pain: Quantitative results from a mixed method pilot study,"This pilot study explored the effects of a psychosocial empirically supported arts drawing protocol for trauma on chronic pain reduction, positive and negative affect, as well as relationships and resources. Additional aims were to explore memory reconsolidation as a change factor in art therapy. The study examined three- and four-drawing protocols and two resource reminder conditions to evaluate which version of the protocol was most helpful. Significant improvements were found in ratings of pain, depression, anxiety, relationship quality, and helplessness from pre-test to post-test, and in the frequency of experiencing pain, depression, fear, anger, relationship problems, and endorsed resources. There were significant differences between groups for anger, and a time by resource reminder condition interaction effect for fear. Exploratory analyses showed similar results for those who participated in the study before and during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and online versus in-person participation. However, pre-pandemic participants reported an increase in frequency of hopefulness over time, yet participants during the pandemic reported a decrease in frequency of experiencing hopefulness over time. Also, online participants reported a greater decrease in hopefulness frequencies when compared to in-person participants. There were no significant differences between the two versions of the protocol or the memory reconsolidation reminder conditions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2020.101749,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2020.101749,Scopus,10.1016/j.aip.2020.101749,2021-04-01,,,
149,Data on media use and mental health during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China,"The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly in China in beginning of 2020. Self-quarantine was suggested by Chinese government to block the spread of the COVID-19. During the self-quarantine, the media played an indispensable role in acquisition of information about the disease. And it could also impact on people's mental health. Therefore, it is necessary to study the psychological outcome resulted from media use during the outbreak of COVID-19. The data in this article could help researchers to explore the mechanism between media use and mental health, and to have a deeper comprehension of the impact of media use on mental health during a public health emergency. The dataset provided in this article included 917 participants recruited from different provinces all over China. Among the participants, there were 304 males and 613 females, with an average age of 28.6 and a standard deviation of 9.5. They took Media Use Questionnaire (MUQ), Empathy-Sympathy Questionnaire (ESQ), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Death Anxiety Questionnaire (DAQ), Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), State boredom Questionnaire (SBQ), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) to assess their media use and mental health during the outbreak of COVID-19. All these instruments for data collection were Chinese versions. In addition, a .csv file consists of major variables we used are included as a supplementary material. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression had been conducted with these data.

150,The COVID-19 outbreak and PNES: The impact of a ubiquitously felt stressor,"Objective We aimed to assess frequency of functional seizures or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) during the COVID-19 outbreak and to recognize possible factors associated with worsening in this population. Methods In this cross-sectional study conducted during the second phase of the pandemic, adult patients with PNES documented by video-EEG and followed up in two tertiary epilepsy centers responded to a structured telephone survey. Data were gathered on demographics, clinical features and frequency of PNES, history of psychiatric comorbidity, access to treatment, as well as on anxiety (GAD-7 items) and depressive symptoms (NDDI-E). Results Fifty-four patients (78% female; mean age of 31.36 years [SD = 10.6]) were contacted and 15 (28%) reported increased frequency of PNES during the pandemic. Higher scores of GAD-7 items ( p < 0.001) and NDDI-E ( p < 0.001) were associated with PNES worsening. There was strong evidence of a correlation between higher stress levels ( p < 0.001) and poor sleep quality ( p 0.005) with PNES aggravation. After regression, stress was the strongest predictor of PNES increased frequency. Significance Patients with functional neurological disorders are vulnerable during ubiquitously felt stressors. However, the atmosphere of uncertainty did not affect these patients equally. Patients with PNES showing symptoms of anxiety and depression are at higher risk of seizure worsening. Early identification of this subset of patients may prevent this detrimental outcome.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107852,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107852,Scopus,10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107852,2021-04-01,,,

152,The proportion and associated factors of anxiety in Chinese adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Background Given the serious impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health of Chinese adolescents, this study aimed to examine the proportion of anxiety and its correlates among Chinese adolescents with depression during the pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional online survey was conducted from February 20th to February 27, 2020 in China. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed by the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), respectively. Results In this study, 3,498 adolescents with depression were identified. Of them, the proportion of anxiety was 45.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]=43.5%-46.8%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that being concerned about graduation (OR=1.25, P=0.002, 95% CI=1.09-1.43), sleep duration <6hr/day (OR=1.80, P<0.001, 95% CI=1.38-2.34), study duration >8hr/day (OR=1.21, P=0.02, 95% CI=1.03-1.42), and quantity of homework higher than before (OR=1.68, P<0.001, 95% CI=1.40-2.02) were positively associated with anxiety; the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at a provincial level of 100-999 (OR=0.70, P<0.001, 95% CI=0.59-0.83) and 1,000-9,999 (OR=0.69, P=0.001, 95% CI=0.55-0.87) were negatively related to anxiety in adolescents with depression. Limitations Because this was a cross-sectional online study, the causality between variables and anxiety could not be examined among depressed adolescents. The use of self-reported scales may lead to an underestimation of the proportion of anxiety among adolescents with depression. Conclusions The symptoms of anxiety were common in adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 outbreak.

153,A pilot randomized controlled trial of a group intervention via Zoom to relieve loneliness and depressive symptoms among older persons during the COVID-19 outbreak,"While effective in reducing infections, social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak may carry ill effects on the mental health of older adults. The present study explored the efficacy of a short-term digital group intervention aimed at providing seniors with the tools and skills necessary for improving their coping ability during these stressful times. A total of 82 community-dwelling adults aged between 65 aged 90 (Mage = 72 years, SD = 5.63) were randomized to either an intervention group (n = 64) or a wait-list control group (n = 18). The intervention comprised online guided sessions in small groups in which behavioral and cognitive techniques were learned and practiced via the ZOOM videoconferencing platform. Loneliness and depression levels were measured pre- and post-participation. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in the intervention group in terms of both loneliness and depressive symptoms, compared with the control group. Results of mixed effect models indicated a medium ameliorative effect on loneliness (d = 0.58), while that for depressive symptoms was only marginally significant and smaller in size (d = 0.43). Our intervention presents a relatively simple and effective technique that can be efficiently utilized to support older adults both during emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as in more routine times for older adults who live alone or reside in remote areas.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100368,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100368,Scopus,10.1016/j.invent.2021.100368,2021-04-01,,,
154,College student mental health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications of campus relocation,"Purpose During the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities evacuated their campuses, requiring students to vacate on campus residences. The psychological outcomes of students who relocated during the pandemic remains unknown. We examined mandated relocation experiences related to self-reported worry, grief, loneliness, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional survey data obtained from April 9 to August 4, 2020 on 791 young adults (ages 18–30 years) who were enrolled at a U.S. university. The CARES 2020 Project (COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study) is an online survey of young adults’ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment relied on snowball sampling. Participants were asked if they were required to relocate from campus and among those who did, their experiences in moving. COVID-19-related worry and grief, loneliness, and depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms were assessed. Results Approximately one-third of students reported being mandated to relocate. Students mandated to relocate reported more COVID-19-related grief, loneliness, and generalized anxiety symptoms compared to those who did not even after controlling for the severity level of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Students who had to leave behind valuable personal belongings reported more COVID-19-related worries, grief, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Students who were mandated to relocate reported worse psychological outcomes compared to students who were not mandated to relocate.

156,"Impact of the first Covid-19 pandemic wave on first episode psychosis in Milan, italy.","The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic appears to increase risk for mental illness, either directly due to inflammation caused by the virus or indirectly due to related psychosocial stress, resulting in the development of both anxious-depressive and psychotic symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to assess the frequency and characteristics of all patients with First Episodes Psychosis (FEP) without COVID-19 infection hospitalized in the first four months since lockdown in Milan. We recruited sixty-two patients hospitalized between March 8 to July 8, 2020 versus those first hospitalized in the same period in 2019. The two subgroups were compared for sociodemographic variables and clinical characteristics of the episodes. Patients with FEP in 2020 were significantly older than patients with FEP in 2021, and presented with significantly less substances abuse. Interestingly, patients presenting with FEP in 2020 were significantly older than patients with FEP in 2019. These data are compatible with the greater vulnerability to stressful factors during the pandemic, as well as with the greater concern regarding a possible COVID-19 infection producing brain damage causing the FEP.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113802,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113802,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113802,2021-04-01,,,

158,Associations between feelings/behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and depression/anxiety after lockdown in a sample of Chinese children and adolescents,"Background Children and adolescents may be more susceptible to mental disorders due to COVID-19 pandemic than adults. This study aimed to identify correlated factors for depression/anxiety among children and adolescents after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Methods An online survey by cluster sampling was conducted after lockdown in 5175 Chinese children and adolescents with informed consents from their parents. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scales with 10-point cutoff were used to measure depression and anxiety, separately. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted. Stata 15.1 Version was used. Results 12.33% and 6.26% of all participants reported depression and anxiety after lockdown, separately. Suicidal ideation, quarreling with parents, insomnia, difficulty in concentrating during online learning, and anxious and depressed mood during lockdown were positively associated with depression and anxiety after lockdown. Missing teachers was negatively associated with both depression and anxiety. Living in urban and not living with parents were positively associated with depression. Limitations The past history and familial history of mental disorders have not been collected. The recall biases for collecting self-reporting information might exist, and the causal inferences cannot be drawn. Conclusions The prevalence of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents might decline a bit after lockdown but is still at a high level after lockdown. Gatekeepers should pay more attention to modifiable factors of psychological well-being in children and adolescents, including family and school contexts and even feelings and behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.001,2021-04-01,,,
159,Socio-economic impact on epilepsy outside of the nation-wide COVID-19 pandemic area,"Objective To identify people with epilepsy (PWE) who required extensive care before the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that had world-wide impacts on medical care and on socio-economic conditions. Methods Consecutive PWE who were treated at the epilepsy center of Hiroshima University Hospital, which was located in the COVID-19 non-pandemic area, between March 2019 and August 2020 were enrolled. We evaluated clinical and socioeconomic factors that were associated with seizure exacerbation (an increase in seizure frequency) during the first 6 months after the COVID-19 pandemic started compared with the previous 6 months. Results Among the 196 PWE who were evaluated (mean age was 37.8 ± 16.2 years), there were 33 PWE (16.8%) whose seizure frequency had increased after the pandemic began. People with epilepsy with a seizure increase showed a significant association with living alone (p < 0.001), a higher seizure frequency (p < 0.001), negative findings on MRI (p = 0.020), history of dissociative seizure (p < 0.001), mood disorders (p < 0.001), insomnia (p < 0.001), and high psychological stress levels (p = 0.024) at baseline compared with PWE without seizure exacerbation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that “living alone” (odds ratio (OR) 3.69; 95%CI 1.29–10.52), “high seizure frequency at baseline” (OR 4.53; 95%CI 1.63–12.57), and “comorbidity of insomnia” (OR 9.55; 95%CI 3.71–24.55) were independently associated with seizure exacerbation. Conclusions Even in the non-pandemic area, PWE had seizure exacerbation, suggesting that clinicians should screen patients’ mental health before the outbreak to provide care, reduce the burden, and prevent social isolation in PWE. This should be addressed particularly in patients with medically refractory seizures with insomnia who live alone.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107886,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107886,Scopus,10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107886,2021-04-01,,,

161,The impact on mental health patients of COVID-19 outbreak in Spain,"Public health studies warn of the vulnerability of people with mental disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, the aims of this study were to (1) explore the presence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and acute stress among people with a mental disorder (MD); (2) evaluate the rate of COVID-19 infection between MD and non-MD, and (3) study the relationship between the emotional state of people with a mental disorder and some environmental variables. A cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques was conducted. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared in MD and non-MD. The rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases among MD and non-MD was compared as well as the relationship between some environmental variables and the emotional state within MD. Up to 1839 [201 (10.9%) MD] participants completed the survey. MD showed significant higher mean (SD) in anxiety [24.7 (11.8) vs. 17 (10.3); p = 0.001], depression [7.9 (6.0) vs. 4.2 (4.2); p = 0.001] and acute stress [6.3 (3.2) vs. 4.4 (3.1); p = 0.001] scores than non-MD. The COVID-19 confirmed cases rate was higher in MD participants than in non-MD (3.5% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.001). Among the MD group, being a COVID-19 confirmed case, the lack in basic needs coverage, the rpesence of violence, drug use and the absence of physical excercise were associated with more severe depressive symptoms.

162,Improving racial disparities in unmet palliative care needs among intensive care unit family members with a needs-targeted app intervention: The ICUconnect randomized clinical trial,"Introduction The technologies used to treat the millions who receive care in intensive care unit (ICUs) each year have steadily advanced. However, the quality of ICU-based communication has remained suboptimal, particularly concerning for Black patients and their family members. Therefore we developed a mobile app intervention for ICU clinicians and family members called ICUconnect that assists with delivering need-based care. Objective To describe the methods and early experiences of a clustered randomized clinical trial (RCT) being conducted to compare ICUconnect vs. usual care. Methods and analysis The goal of this two-arm, parallel group clustered RCT is to determine the clinical impact of the ICUconnect intervention in improving outcomes overall and for each racial subgroup on reducing racial disparities in core palliative care outcomes over a 3-month follow up period. ICU attending physicians are randomized to either ICUconnect or usual care, with outcomes obtained from family members of ICU patients. The primary outcome is change in unmet palliative care needs measured by the NEST instrument between baseline and 3 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include goal concordance of care and interpersonal processes of care at 3 days post-randomization; length of stay; as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 months post-randomization. We will use hierarchical linear models to compare outcomes between the ICUconnect and usual care arms within all participants and assess for differential intervention effects in Blacks and Whites by adding a patient-race interaction term. We hypothesize that both compared to usual care as well as among Blacks compared to Whites, ICUconnect will reduce unmet palliative care needs, psychological distress and healthcare resource utilization while improving goal concordance and interpersonal processes of care. In this manuscript, we also describe steps taken to adapt the ICUconnect intervention to the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare setting. Enrollment status A total of 36 (90%) of 40 ICU physicians have been randomized and 83 (52%) of 160 patient-family dyads have been enrolled to date.

163,"The effect of quarantine due to Covid-19 pandemic on seizure frequency in 102 adult people with epilepsy from Apulia and Basilicata regions, Southern Italy","Objective following the COVID-19 pandemic, a quarantine was imposed to all of regions Italy by 9th March until 3rd May 2020. We investigated the effect of COVID-19 infection and quarantine on seizure frequency in adult people with epilepsy (PwE) of Apulia and Basilicata regions, Southern Italy. Methods This is an observational, retrospective study based on prospective data collection of 102 successive PWE. The frequency of seizures was evaluated during pre-quarantine (January- February), quarantine (March–April), and post–quarantine period (May-June), while PwE were divided into A) cases responding to treatment with ≤ 1 seizure per year; B) cases responding to treatment with 2–5 seizure per year; C) cases with drug-resistant epilepsy with ≤ 4 seizures per month; D) cases with drug-resistant epilepsy with 5–10 seizures per month. PwE underwent several self-report questionnaires regarding therapeutic compliance, mood, stress and sleep during quarantine period. Results Approximately 50 % of PwE showed seizure frequency changes (22.55 % an increase and 27.45 % a reduction) during quarantine. Seizure frequency significantly (p < 0.05) increased in PwE responding to treatment with ≤ 1 seizure per year, while significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in PwE with drug-resistant epilepsy with 5–10 seizures per month. The data was not influenced by therapeutic adherence, sleep and depression. The analysis of anxiety showed a moderate level of anxiety in PwE responding to treatment with < 1 seizure per year, while moderate stress was perceived by all PwE. Seizure frequency changes were related to quarantine, but not to COVID-19 infection. In fact, unlike other regions of Italy, particularly Northern Italy, Apulia and Basilicata regions were less affected by COVID-19 infection, and almost all PwE recognized the quarantine as a stressful event. Emotional distress and anxiety due to social isolation, but also the relative reduction of triggers for epileptic seizures were the most important factors for changes in seizure frequency. Conclusions Our study adds to the growing concern that the indirect effects of COVID-19 pandemic will far outstrip the direct consequences of the infection.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106592,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106592,Scopus,10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106592,2021-04-01,,,
164,"Rapid Report 3: Mental health symptoms, characteristics, and regional variation, for users of an Australian digital mental health service during the first 8 months of COVID-19","Background The MindSpot Clinic provides services to Australians with anxiety and depression. Routine data collection means that MindSpot has been able to monitor trends in mental health symptoms and service use prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and these have been reported in two earlier studies. This third study describes user characteristics and volumes in the first 8 months of COVID-19, including a comparison between users from states and territories with significantly different COVID-19 infection rates. Methods We examined trends in demographics and symptoms for participants starting an online assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic, from March to October 2020. Participants from the state of Victoria (n = 4203), which experienced a significantly larger rate of COVID-19 infections relative to the rest of Australia, were compared to participants from the rest of Australia (n = 10,500). Results were also compared to a baseline “comparison period” prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 14,703 people started a mental health assessment with MindSpot between 19th March and 28th October 2020. We observed two peaks in service demand, one in the early weeks of the pandemic, and the second in August–September when COVID-19 transmission was high in Victoria. Mean symptom scores on standardised measures of distress (K-10), depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) were lower during this second peak in service demand, but there were significantly higher levels of concern about COVID-19 in participants from Victoria, and a higher proportion of Victorian respondents reported that they had made significant changes in response to the pandemic. Many respondents reported changes to their mental health, such as increased feelings of worry. Most respondents reported implementing strategies to help manage the psychological impact of COVID-19, such as maintaining social connections and limiting exposure to news or social media. Conclusions We did not observe increased levels of clinical anxiety or depression on standardised symptom measures. However, there were increases in service demand, and increased levels of concern and difficulties related to COVID-19, particularly in Victoria. Encouragingly, a significant proportion of participants have implemented coping strategies. These results continue to suggest that the mental health impacts of COVID-19 represent a normal response to an abnormal situation rather than an emerging mental health crisis. This distinction is important as we develop individually appropriate and proportional mental health system responses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100378,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100378,Scopus,10.1016/j.invent.2021.100378,2021-04-01,,,
165,Psychosocial experiences of postnatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic. A UK-wide study of prevalence rates and risk factors for clinically relevant depression and anxiety,"Background When the vulnerabilities of the postnatal period are combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, psychosocial outcomes are likely to be affected. Specifically, we aim to: a) explore the psychosocial experiences of women in the early postnatal period; b) describe prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression; and c) explore whether psychosocial change occurring as a result of COVID-19 is predictive of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression. Methods A sample of UK mothers (N = 614) with infants aged between birth and twelve weeks were recruited via convenience sampling. A cross-sectional survey design was utilised which comprised demographics, COVID-19 specific questions, and a battery of validated psychosocial measures, including the EPDS and STAI-S which were used to collect prevalence rates of clinically relevant depression and anxiety respectively. Data collection coincided with the UK government's initial mandated “lockdown” restrictions and the introduction of social distancing measures in 2020. Findings Descriptive findings from the overall sample indicate that a high percentage of mothers self-reported psychological and social changes as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures. For women who reported the presence of psychosocial change, these changes were perceived negatively. Whilst seventy women (11.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of depression, two hundred and sixty-four women (43%) reported a score of ≥13 on the EPDS, indicating clinically relevant depression. Whilst one hundred and thirteen women (18.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of anxiety, three hundred and seventy-three women (61%) reported a score of ≥40 on STAI-S, indicating clinically relevant anxiety. After accounting for current clinical diagnoses of depression or anxiety, and demographic factors known to influence mental health, only perceived psychological change occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk of clinically relevant maternal depression (30%) and anxiety (33%). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first national study to examine the psychosocial experiences of postnatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety were extremely high when compared to both self-reported current diagnoses of depression and anxiety, and pre-pandemic prevalence studies. Perceived psychological changes occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk for clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety. This study provides vital information for clinicians, funders, policy makers, and researchers to inform the immediate next steps in perinatal care, policy, and research during COVID-19 and future health crises.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.048,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.048,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.048,2021-04-01,,,

170,"The health and social consequences during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic among current and former people who inject drugs: A rapid phone survey in Baltimore, Maryland","Background There is limited data on the health and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among people who inject drugs (PWID). Methods We conducted a rapid telephone survey from April-June 2020 among participants of the community-based AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland. This interviewer-administered survey collected information on COVID-19 knowledge, symptoms, testing, diagnosis, and prevention behaviors, recent substance use, housing conditions, interruptions to healthcare, access to harm reduction and drug treatment, mental health, and social support. Results Of 443 current and former PWID who participated in the survey, 36 % were female, 85 % were Black, 33 % were living with HIV and 50 % reported any substance use in the prior six months. COVID-19 awareness was high, but knowledge of symptoms and routes of transmission were lower. PWID reporting recent substance use were less likely to always socially distance (63 % vs. 74 % among those without recent use, p = 0.02), and Black PWID were more likely than non-Black to socially distance (73 % vs. 48 %, p < 0.0001) and use when alone (68 % vs.35 %, p < 0.01). Only 6% reported difficulty accessing healthcare, yet only 48 % of those on opioid-agonist treatment had a four-week supply available. While 34 % reported increased depressive symptoms, participants reported high levels of social support. Conclusions This rapid assessment highlighted that PWID currently using drugs may be less able to practice social distancing and increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission may occur. Ongoing monitoring of substance use and mental health, as well as overdose prevention is necessary as the pandemic and public health responses continue.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108584,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108584,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108584,2021-04-01,,,

174,Mental health issues among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic – A study from India,"Mental health issues among health care workers (HCWs) in treatment settings during COVID-19 remains understudied in India. This study examines its prevalence and correlates among HCWs in Karnataka State, India. HCWs who attended a workshop to improve mental health well-being during COVID-19 completed an anonymous online questionnaire. In addition to socio-demographics, domains assessed include occupational characteristics, COVID-19 related concerns, anxiety/depression, substance use, suicidality, lifestyle and family functioning. Of the 3083 HCWs who completed the survey (response rate-51.4 %), anxiety disorder and depression was highest among those with frontline COVID-19 responsibilities (anxiety disorder-26.6 %, depression-23.8 %). Prevalence was significantly higher among those with clinical responsibilities compared to those with supportive responsibilities (anxiety disorder: 23.9 % vs 15.5 %), (depression: 20.0 % vs 14.2 %). In the backward step-wise logistic regression analysis, HCWs with anxiety disorder were more likely to be doctors/nurses/hospital assistants, older, female, unmarried, without a leisure activity, report increased alcohol use and suicidal thoughts after pandemic onset, and having a history of receiving mental health interventions. Participants with depression additionally had family distress and hardly ever exercised. To conclude, mental health issues are common among HCWs in India. Interventions need to ensure that HCWs are protected from mental health consequences of working in COVID-19 treatment settings.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102626,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102626,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102626,2021-04-01,,,
175,"Essential work, precarious labour: The need for safer and equitable harm reduction work in the era of COVID-19","This commentary highlights labour concerns and inequities within the harm reduction sector that hinder programs’ ability to respond to converging public health emergencies (the overdose crisis and COVID-19), and potentially contribute to spread of the novel coronavirus. Many harm reduction programs continue to support people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic, yet PWUD working in harm reduction programs (sometimes termed ‘peers’) experience precarious labour conditions characterized by low wages, minimal employee benefits (such as paid sick leave) and high employment insecurity. Along with precarious labour conditions, PWUD face heightened vulnerabilities to COVID-19 and yet have been largely overlooked in global response to the pandemic. Operating under conditions of economic and legal precarity, harm reduction programs’ reliance on precarious labour (e.g. on-call, temporary and unpaid work) renders some services vulnerable to staffing shortages and service disruptions during the pandemic, while also heightening the risk of virus transmission among workers, service users and their communities. We call for immediate policy and programmatic actions to strengthen working conditions within these settings with a priority on enhancing protections and supports for workers in peer roles.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103076,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103076,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103076,2021-04-01,,,
176,Mental health status of healthcare versus other essential workers in Australia amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: Initial results from the collate project,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has necessitated many healthcare workers operating on the frontlines. Another segment of the population whose mental well-being is being tested are the ‘other essential workers’ (e.g. supermarket workers). The current study aimed to compare the mental health of healthcare versus other essential workers in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE) project is a nationwide online mental health survey launched on 1 April 2020, aimed at identifying key mental health concerns. Adults currently living in Australia were invited to take part, and non-discriminative snowball sampling was employed. Participants were partitioned into healthcare workers (HCW; n=905), other essential workers (OEW; n=810), and the general population (GNP; n=3443). Across all groups, top COVID-19 related concerns were primarily associated with the health and well-being of loved ones. In terms of current levels of depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life, HCWs fared the best, and OEWs fared the worst (with the GNP falling in between). In the face of this medical crisis, Australian HCWs seem to be managing their mental health relatively well, but more supports need to be devoted to OEWs to safeguard their mental well-being.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113822,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113822,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113822,2021-04-01,,,

178,Top problems of adolescents and young adults with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective ADHD symptom severity appears to be exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study surveyed top problems experienced by adolescents and young adults (A/YAs) with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify possible reasons for symptom escalation and potential targets for intervention. We also explored perceived benefits of the pandemic for A/YAs with ADHD. Method At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (April–June 2020), we administered self and parent ratings about current and pre-pandemic top problem severity and benefits of the pandemic to a sample of convenience (N = 134 A/YAs with ADHD participating in a prospective longitudinal study). Results The most common top problems reported in the sample were social isolation (parent-report: 26.7%; self-report: 41.5%), difficulties engaging in online learning (parent-report: 23.3%, self-report: 20.3%), motivation problems (parent-report: 27.9%), and boredom (self-report: 21.3%). According to parent (d = 0.98) and self-report (d = 1.33), these top problems were more severe during the pandemic than in prior months. Contrary to previous speculation, there was no evidence that pandemic-related changes mitigated ADHD severity. Multi-level models indicated that A/YAs with higher IQs experienced severer top problems exacerbations at the transition to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions For A/YAs with ADHD, several risk factors for depression and school dropout were incurred during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. A/YAs with ADHD should be monitored for school disengagement and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommended interventions attend to reducing risk factors such as increasing social interaction, academic motivation, and behavioral activation among A/YAs with ADHD.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.009,2021-04-01,,,
179,"Financial performances, entrepreneurial factors and coping strategy to survive in the COVID-19 pandemic: case of Vietnam","Vietnam has been one of a few countries that successfully contained the COVID-19 pandemic. However, aggressive measurements against the pandemic were at the expense of economic activities and companies’ financial performances. This cross-sectional study uses a survey of 672 companies in Vietnam and the logistic regression model to explore companies’ coping strategy choices based on their degree of financial distress, companies’ profiles, entrepreneurial factors, and the interactions between them. The results suggest that companies predominantly selected cost-cutting strategies to deal with the economic shutdown. However, the interactions between financial and entrepreneurial factors could significantly increase the likelihood of selecting growth-focused strategies. Besides, when facing a global pandemic such as COVID-19, managers’ perceptions about the spillover effects of global risks were much more impactful than local risks on companies’ coping strategy selections.

180,Addressing the mental health impact of COVID-19 through population health,"The COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to result in negative mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety and traumatic stress in people and populations throughout the world. A population mental health perspective informed by clinical psychology, psychiatry and dissemination and implementation science is ideally suited to address the broad, multi-faceted and long-lasting mental health impact of the pandemic. Informed by a systematic review of the burgeoning empirical research on the COVID-19 pandemic and research on prior coronavirus pandemics, we link pandemic risk factors, negative mental health outcomes and appropriate intervention strategies. We describe how social risk factors and pandemic stressors will contribute to negative mental health outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations. We evaluate the scalability of primary, secondary and tertiary interventions according to mental health target, population, modality, intensity and provider type to provide a unified strategy for meeting population mental health needs. Traditional models, in which evidence-based therapies delivered are delivered in-person, by a trained expert, at a specialty care location have proved difficult to scale. The use of non-traditional models, tailoring preventive interventions to populations based on their needs, and ongoing coordinated evaluation of intervention implementation and effectiveness will be critical to refining our efforts to increase reach.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2021.102006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2021.102006,Scopus,10.1016/j.cpr.2021.102006,2021-04-01,,,

However, there is a limited understanding of suicide among individuals with positive/suspected COVID diagnosis specifically. Hence, this study, using online newspaper reports, aimed to determine factors influencing suicide among individuals withCOVID-19 infection status. Methodology : Information regarding positive/suspected COVID related suicide was obtained from online newspapers published in 4 languages between 30th Jan 2020 to 16th August 2020 using google news aggregator. Of 235 online identified, 93 were eligible for analysis after the exclusion and analysed using descriptive statistics. Results : Median Age of COVID related suicide victims was 45 years (range 15 - 80) wherein 61.3% belonged to 30-59 year age group, and 75.3% were males. 50% of suicides occurred within the first week of COVID diagnosis confirmation, and 50% suicides occurred at COVID centres. Hanging (53.8%) was the commonest method of suicide, followed by jumping (12.9%). Conclusion : Higher risk for suicide was observed among male gender and those with positive/suspected COVID infection within the first week, while receiving treatment in COVID care centres. Hanging and jumping were the two commonest methods.

183,"Attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care needs among parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic","Background COVID-19 pandemic has generated anxiety and mental health issues in the common population. In general, anxiety and poor health are higher in parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) than parents of children without ASD. However, the symptoms of anxiety, depression and poor mental health are likely to be more escalated in parents of children with ASD during COVID-19, possibly due to the emergency measures involving suspension of essential services, closure of schools, work-from-home policy and lack of professional support, etc. Aim This empirical research aimed to explore the attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care of parents of children with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A total of 211 participants, including mothers and fathers of children with ASD from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, participated in this online study. Along with demographic details, data on attitude, anxiety, mental health status and perceived mental health care were obtained using both self-reported questionnaire and reference standard questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using t-test, Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis. The responses to open-ended questions were also collected and analysed qualitatively. Results The study revealed that attitudes towards taking care of children with ASD were affected by parents' age and child's age, and mothers were more affected. Further, the anxiety of parents during COVID-19 was significantly higher than before the COVID-19 situation. It was found that parents' mental status during COVID-19 mediated the interaction between anxiety and perceived mental health care. Finally, the open-ended questions indicated that parents sought support from teachers, family members and therapists to deal with children with ASD during the pandemic outbreak. In the context of perceived mental health care, besides psychological and financial support, other measures like training sessions, online classes, etc., were recommended. Conclusions The findings of this study insisted on the importance of support from government and local health authorities to introduce interventions for parents and children with ASD to improve the overall mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103873,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103873,Scopus,10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103873,2021-04-01,,,
184,A survey of postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women during the pandemic of COVID-19,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic seriously endangers the public's mental health, especially to pregnant and postpartum women. But little is known about postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women. Aim To investigate the status and risk factors of postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 209 Chinese postpartum women were recruited from May to July 2020 by convenience sampling and assessed online with self-designed Maternal General Information Questionnaire, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) and Chinese Version of the Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS). Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. Results With the EPDS cut-off value of 10, the incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms was 56.9%. Age, history of abortion and perceived stress were the influencing factors of postpartum depression (adjusted R 2 = 0.432, F = 23.611, p < .001). The top three health care needs were infant rearing guidance (78.0%), maternal and infant protection guidance (60.3%) and dietary guidance (45.0%). The proportion of psychological rehabilitation guidance needs in the depressed group was significantly higher than that in the non-depressed group (34.5% vs. 20.0%, p < .05). Conclusions Maternal postpartum depression in China was at a high level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women aged 25–34, with a history of abortion and high stress levels were at higher risk for postpartum depression.

185,"Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on mental health, wellbeing, sleep, and alcohol use in a UK student sample","The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictions imposed by governments worldwide have had profound social and psychological effects, particularly for young adults. This study used longitudinal data to characterise effects on mental health and behaviour in a UK student sample, measuring sleep quality and diurnal preference, depression and anxiety symptoms, wellbeing and loneliness, and alcohol use. Self-report data was collected from 254 undergraduates (219 females) at a UK university at two-time points: autumn 2019 (baseline, pre-pandemic) and April/May 2020 (under ‘lockdown’ conditions). Longitudinal analyses showed a significant rise in depression symptoms and a reduction in wellbeing at lockdown. Over a third of the sample could be classed as clinically depressed at lockdown compared to 15% at baseline. Sleep quality was not affected across the sample as a whole. The increase in depression symptoms was highly correlated with worsened sleep quality. A reduction in alcohol use, and a significant shift towards an ‘evening’ diurnal preference, were also observed. Levels of worry surrounding contracting COVID-19 were high.

186,"Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) data contributed by 13,829 respondents to a national survey about COVID-19 restrictions in Australia","While the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) are frequently used in mental health research, few studies have reported comprehensive data on these measures from population or community samples. The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used as indicators of symptoms of depression and anxiety in a national online anonymous survey to assess the mental health of adults in Australia during the COVID-19 restrictions. The aim of this study was to describe gender- and age-specific PHQ-9 and GAD-7 item and summary data contributed by those who completed this survey. Data were analysed descriptively. Complete survey responses were contributed by 13,829 people. For both measures, item-by-item results, summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median and interquartile range) and prevalence of severity categories are reported for the whole sample, and disaggregated by gender and age groups.

188,Relationship between sleep quality and the psychological status of patients hospitalised with COVID-19,"Aim We explored the sleep quality of patients who required mental health and clinical interventions in our hospital after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Method We enrolled 189 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in April and May of 2020, of whom 78 were female and 111 male. We evaluated sleep quality and related factors in terms of demographic characteristics, the duration of hospitalisation, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale scores. Results All participants were divided into two groups according to PSQI score: n = 102 (54%) patients with PSQI scores ≥5 and n = 87 (46%) patients with PSQI scores <5. No significant between-group difference was evident in terms of age, gender, marital status, educational level, or chronic disease history. The duration of hospitalisation (p = 0.002) and the depression rate (p = 0.010) were higher in the group exhibiting poor sleep quality (PSQI score ≥5). Conclusion The duration of hospitalisation was longer in patients experiencing poor sleep quality.

189,"Trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A one-month follow-up","Objectives Little is known about the mental health outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The aims of the study were: (1) to examine the trajectories of anxiety, depression, and pandemic-related stress factors (PRSF) of COVID-19 hospitalized patients one-month following hospitalization; (2) to assess the presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) a month after hospitalization; (3) to identify baseline risk and protective factors that would predict PTSS one month after hospitalization. Methods We contacted hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 64) by phone, at three time-points: during the first days after admission to the hospital (T1); after ~two weeks from the beginning of hospitalization (T2), and one month after hospitalization (T3). At all time-points we assessed the levels of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as PRSF. At T3, PTSS were assessed. Results The levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms decreased one-month following hospitalization. Moreover, higher levels of anxiety (standardized β = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.81–1.49, p < 0.001) and depression (β = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.63–1.31 p < 0.001) symptoms during the first week of hospitalization, feeling socially disconnected (β = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37–0.81 p < 0.001) and experiencing a longer hospitalization period (β = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.03–0.47 p = 0.026) predicted higher PTSS scores a month post-hospitalization.

190,"The use of mental health promotion strategies by nurses to reduce anxiety, stress, and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak: A prospective cohort study","Objectives To evaluate and compare nurses' depression, anxiety and stress symptoms at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and after six months; to evaluate and compare the frequency of use of mental health promotion strategies during the same period; and to identify the relationship between the frequency of use of mental health promotion strategies, during the same period, with nurses’ depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Methods Data collection was carried out in two moments: at baseline and after six months. An online questionnaire was applied to nurses to assess the frequency of use of some mental health promotion strategies and their depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (through the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales – short version (DASS-21)). Results The anxiety and stress symptoms significantly decreased over time. The physical activity increased, and a decrease was observed in the remote social contacts after six months. The stress, anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in nurses who frequently or always used all strategies compared to participants who never or rarely used them, except for one strategy (rejecting information about COVID-19 from unreliable sources). Conclusions Mental health promotion strategies, such as physical activity, relaxation activity, recreational activity, healthy diet, adequate water intake, breaks between work shifts, maintenance of remote social contacts, and verbalization of feelings/emotions, are crucial to reduce nurses’ stress, anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110828,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110828,Scopus,10.1016/j.envres.2021.110828,2021-04-01,,,
191,Increased alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic: The effect of mental health and age in a cross-sectional sample of social media users in the U.S.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a public health crisis of unprecedented scale. Increased alcohol use has been extensively documented during other crises, particularly among persons with anxiety and depression. Despite COVID-19's differential impact by age, the association of age, mental health and alcohol use during the pandemic has not been explored. This study aimed to examine whether age modified the association of anxiety and depressive symptoms with alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two online surveys were administered to U.S. adult social media users in March and April 2020. Generalized linear models were conducted in 2020 among 5850 respondents (52.9% female; 22.0% aged 18–39 years, 47.0% aged 40–59 years, and 31.0% aged ≥60 years) to examine if age modified the association of anxiety and depression symptomatology and alcohol use. Overall, 29% of respondents reported increased alcohol use. Adjusted odds ratios of reporting increased alcohol use were 1.41 (95% CI = 1.20–1.66) among respondents with anxiety symptoms and 1.64 (95% CI = 1.21–2.23) among those with depressive symptoms compared to those without such symptoms. Whereas respondents aged 18–39 years had the highest probability of reporting increased alcohol use, the probability of older persons (40–59 and ≥60 years) reporting increased drinking was much greater among those with symptoms of anxiety and depression, compared to those without symptoms. These findings warrant age-differentiated public health messaging on the risks of excessive alcohol use and scale-up of substance use services for middle-aged and older adults with symptoms of depression and anxiety.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106422,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106422,Scopus,10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106422,2021-04-01,,,

However, few studies have followed-up participants as the pandemic evolved and examined both between and within person predictors of symptom trajectories. In the current study, adolescents and young adults (N=532) in New York were surveyed monthly between March 27th and July 14th, 2020, a period spanning the first peak and subsequent decline in COVID-19 infection rates in the region. Surveys assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Child Depression Inventory and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, as well as experiences related to the pandemic. Multilevel growth modeling indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety peaked around late April/early May and then decreased through May-July. Some pandemic experiences followed a similar quadratic trajectory, while others decreased linearly across the study. Specific relationships emerged between some types of pandemic experiences and depression and anxiety symptoms. While symptoms of depression and anxiety in youth may have been elevated early in the pandemic, these findings suggest they subsided across Spring-Summer of 2020, with higher levels of both corresponding to a period of peak infection rates and decreases paralleling the decline in pandemic experiences and COVID-19 infection rates.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113778,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113778,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113778,2021-04-01,,,

The aim of this study is to examine the impact of job insecurity on hotel employees’ anxiety and depression, and whether these psychological strains could influence employees’ self-rated task performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also examine the moderating role of hotel employees’ resilience in this context. The hypotheses were examined by collecting data from 353 hotel employees currently working in the Canary Islands (Spain). The results highlight the significant effects of job insecurity on employees’ anxiety and depression levels. However, hotel employees’ task performance was not affected by their job insecurity or by their anxiety and depression. In addition, employees’ resilience has a moderating effect as it reduces the negative influence of job insecurity on depression.

199,Reducing the stigma of mental health disorders with a focus on low- and middle-income countries,"Mental health disorders are a burgeoning global public health challenge, and disproportionately affect the poor. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear 80 % of the mental health disease burden. Stigma associated with mental health results in delayed help seeking, reduced access to health services, suboptimal treatment, poor outcomes and an increased risk of individuals’ human rights violations. Moreover, widespread co-occurrence of physical comorbidities such as noncommunicable diseases with mental health disorders makes the treatment of both conditions challenging and worsens prognosis. This paper explores various aspects of stigma towards mental health with a focus on LMICs and assesses measures to increase help-seeking and access to and uptake of mental health services. Stigma impacts persons living with mental illness, their families and caregivers and healthcare professionals (mental health professionals, non-psychiatric specialists and general practitioners) imparting mental health care. Cultural, socio-economic and religious factors determine various aspects of mental health in LMICs, ranging from perceptions of health and illness, health seeking behavior, attitudes of the individuals and health practitioners and mental health systems. Addressing stigma requires comprehensive and inclusive mental health policies and legislations; sustainable and culturally-adapted awareness programs; capacity building of mental health workforce through task-shifting and interprofessional approaches; and improved access to mental health services by integration with primary healthcare and utilizing existing pathways of care. Future strategies targeting stigma reduction must consider the enormous physical comorbidity burden associated with mental health, prioritize workplace interventions and importantly, address the deterioration of population mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102601,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102601,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102601,2021-04-01,,,
200,Induction of stress resistance and extension of lifespan in Chaenorhabditis elegans serotonin-receptor knockout strains by withanolide A,"Introduction Approximately 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression. The COVID-19 crisis may dramatically increase these numbers. Severe side effects and resistance development limit the use of standard antidepressants. The steroidal lactone withanolide A (WA) from Withania somnifera may be a promising alternative. Caenorhabditis elegans was used as model to explore WA's anti-depressive and anti-stress potential. Methods C. elegans wildtype (N2) and deficient strains (AQ866, DA1814, DA2100, DA2109 and MT9772) were used to assess oxidative, osmotic or heat stress as measured by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), determination of lifespan, and mRNA expression of serotonin receptor (ser-1, ser-4, ser-7) and serotonin transporter genes (mod-5). The protective effect of WA was compared to fluoxetine as clinically established antidepressant. Additionally, WA's effect on lifespan was determined. Furthermore, the binding affinities and pKi values of WA, fluoxetine and serotonin as natural ligand to Ser-1, Ser-4, Ser-7, Mod-5 and their human orthologues proteins were calculated by molecular docking. Results Baseline oxidative stress was higher in deficient than wildtype worms. WA and fluoxetine reduced ROS levels in all strains except MT9772. WA and fluoxetine prolonged survival times in wildtype and mutants under osmotic stress. WA but not fluoxetine increased lifespan of all heat-stressed C. elegans strains except DA2100. Furthermore, WA but not fluoxetine extended lifespan in all non-stressed C. elegans strains. WA also induced mRNA expression of serotonin receptors and transporters in wildtype and mutants. WA bound with higher affinity and lower pKi values to all C. elegans and human serotonin receptors and transporters than serotonin, indicating that WA may competitively displaced serotonin from the binding pockets of these proteins. Conclusion WA reduced stress and increased lifespan by ROS scavenging and interference with the serotonin system. Hence, WA may serve as promising candidate to treat depression.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153482,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153482,Scopus,10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153482,2021-04-01,,,

The main aim of this study was to investigate the 30-day prevalence of STB and associated risk factors. Methods As part of the Recovering Emotionally from COVID study (RECOVID), 30-day STB among healthcare professionals (N = 6,409) was assessed in an e-survey in healthcare settings in Belgium. The prevalence of STB and associated risk factors were estimated in multivariable models with individual-level and society-level measures of association. We used post-stratification weights to make the data representative for the entire clinical workforce in Belgium. Results Prevalence was 3.6% death wish, 1.5% suicide ideation, 1.0% suicide plan, and 0.0% suicide attempt. Thirty-day STB was (a) increased among respondents with lifetime and current mental disorders (mostly depression) and those hospitalized for COVID19 infection, (b) decreased among respondents with social support, and (c) unrelated to work environment. Limitations This is an explorative cross-sectional study using multivariate models that generates specific hypotheses on the prevalence of and risk factors for STB during the COVID19 pandemic rather than testing specific pathways that lead to STB onset. Conclusions Across age, gender, professional discipline, and exposure to COVID, lifetime and current mental disorders were highly associated with STB. These factors could guide governments and healthcare organizations in taking up responsibilities in preventing emotional problems and developing resilience among healthcare professionals during, but probably beyond, the current COVID19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.013,2021-03-15,,,

The aim of this study is to establish the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is entailing, particularly with regards to levels of stress, anxiety and depression, and to the risks of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Methods The study, carried out with a sample of 1612 subjects distributed in seven countries (Australia, China, Ecuador, Iran, Italy, Norway and the United States), allowed us to collect information about the psychological impact of COVID-19. Results The findings of this study show that the levels of stress, depression and anxiety, as well as the risks of PTSD, are higher than average in over half of the considered sample. The severity of these disorders significantly depends on gender, type of outdoor activities, characteristics of their homes, eventual presence of infected acquaintances, time dedicated to looking for related information (in the news and social networks), type of source information and, in part, to the level of education and income. Conclusions We conclude that COVID-19 has a very strong psychological impact on the global population.

203,Resilience and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Resilience is a process that allows recovery from or adaptation to adversities. The aim of this study was to evaluate state resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in psychiatric patients (PP), unaffected relatives (UR) and community controls (CC). Methods: This study is part of the Barcelona ResIlience Survey for Mental Health COVID-19 (BRIS-MHC) project. Logistic regression models were performed to identify mental health outcomes associated with bad state resilience and predictors of good state resilience. The association between state resilience and specific affective temperaments as well as their influence on the association between depressive symptoms and state resilience were verified. Results: The study recruited 898 participants that took part in the survey. The presence of depressive symptoms was a predictor of bad state resilience in PP (β=0.110, OR=1.117, p=0.028). No specific mental health outcome was associated with bad state resilience in UR and CC. Predictors of good state resilience in PP were having pursued hobbies/conducted home tasks (β=1.261, OR=3.528, p=0.044) and level of organization in the family (β=0.986, OR=2.682, p=0.008). Having a controlling family was inversely associated with good state resilience in CC (β=-1.004, OR=0.367, p=0.012). The association between bad state resilience and depressive symptoms was partially mediated by affective temperaments. Limitations: Participants self-reported their psychiatric diagnoses, their relatives’ diagnoses or the absence of a psychiatric disorder, as well as their psychiatric symptoms.

207,Innate Inhibiting Proteins Enhance Expression and Immunogenicity of Self-Amplifying RNA,"Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a cutting-edge platform for both nucleic acid vaccines and therapeutics. saRNA is self-adjuvanting, as it activates types I and III interferon (IFN), which enhances the immunogenicity of RNA vaccines but can also lead to inhibition of translation. In this study, we screened a library of saRNA constructs with cis-encoded innate inhibiting proteins (IIPs) and determined the effect on protein expression and immunogenicity. We observed that the PIV-5 V and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ORF4a proteins enhance protein expression 100- to 500-fold in vitro in IFN-competent HeLa and MRC5 cells. We found that the MERS-CoV ORF4a protein partially abates dose nonlinearity in vivo, and that ruxolitinib, a potent Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibitor, but not the IIPs, enhances protein expression of saRNA in vivo. Both the PIV-5 V and MERS-CoV ORF4a proteins were found to enhance the percentage of resident cells in human skin explants expressing saRNA and completely rescued dose nonlinearity of saRNA. Finally, we observed that the MERS-CoV ORF4a increased the rabies virus (RABV)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) by ∼10-fold in rabbits, but not in mice or rats. These experiments provide a proof of concept that IIPs can be directly encoded into saRNA vectors and effectively abate the nonlinear dose dependency and enhance immunogenicity.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.11.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.11.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.11.011,2021-03-03,,,

The search terms included, “SARS-CoV-2”, “etiology,” “psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions”, “severe infections” “COVID-19”. Specific choices of unique papers from each of the searches were identified. The inclusion criteria were relevance and availability of full-text. Papers were excluded on the basis of relevance and non-availability of full-text. Papers were identified in the general literature reserve as pertinent to the search terms. Results The main psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions analyzed were depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis, nonspecific neurological symptoms, delirium, cerebrovascular complications, encephalopathies, neuromuscular disorders, anosmia and ageusia. Conclusion The psychiatric and neuropsychiatric symptoms of acute respiratory syndromes can appear during or after the infectious stage. Among the risk factors pointed out for such effects are the female gender, health professionals, presence of avascular necrosis and distressing pain.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110159,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110159,Scopus,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110159,2021-03-02,,,

214,Self-harm during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic in England: Comparative trend analysis of hospital presentations,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures necessary to address it may have major effects on mental health, including on self-harm. We have used well-established monitoring systems in two hospitals in England to investigate trends in self-harm presentations to hospitals during the early period of the pandemic. Method: Data collected in Oxford and Derby on patients aged 18 years and over who received a psychosocial assessment after presenting to the emergency departments following self-harm were used to compare trends during the three-month period following lockdown in the UK (23rd March 2020) to the period preceding lockdown and the equivalent period in 2019. Results: During the 12 weeks following introduction of lockdown restrictions there was a large reduction in the number of self-harm presentations to hospitals by individuals aged 18 years and over compared to the pre-lockdown weeks in 2020 (mean weekly reduction of 13.5 (95% CI 5.6 - 21.4) and the equivalent period in 2019 (mean weekly reduction of 18.0 (95% CI 13.9 - 22.1). The reduction was greater in females than males, occurred in all age groups, with a larger reduction in presentations following self-poisoning than self-injury. Conclusions: A substantial decline in hospital presentations for self-harm occurred during the three months following the introduction of lockdown restrictions. Reasons could include a reduction in self-harm at the community level and individuals avoiding presenting to hospital following self-harm. Longer-term monitoring of self-harm behaviour during the pandemic is essential, together with efforts to encourage help-seeking and the modification of care provision.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.015,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.015,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.015,2021-03-01,,,

216,Utility of Hypertonic Saline and Diazepam in COVID-19–Related Hydroxychloroquine Toxicity,"Background Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) poisoning is a life-threatening but treatable toxic ingestion. The scale of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) and the controversial suggestion that HCQ is a treatment option have led to a significant increase in HCQ use. HCQ poisoning should be at the top-of-mind for emergency providers in cases of toxic ingestion. Treatment for HCQ poisoning includes sodium bicarbonate, epinephrine, and aggressive electrolyte repletion. We highlight the use of hypertonic saline and diazepam. Case Report We describe the case of a 37-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after the ingestion of approximately 16 g of HCQ tablets (initial serum concentration 4270 ng/mL). He was treated with an epinephrine infusion, hypertonic sodium chloride, high-dose diazepam, sodium bicarbonate, and aggressive potassium repletion. Persistent altered mental status necessitated intubation, and he was managed in the medical intensive care unit until his QRS widening and QTc prolongation resolved. After his mental status improved and it was confirmed that his ingestion was not with the intent to self-harm, he was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? For patients presenting with HCQ overdose and an unknown initial serum potassium level, high-dose diazepam and hypertonic sodium chloride should be started immediately for the patient with widened QRS. The choice of hypertonic sodium chloride instead of sodium bicarbonate is to avoid exacerbating underlying hypokalemia which may in turn potentiate unstable dysrhythmia. In addition, early intubation should be a priority in vomiting patients because both HCQ toxicity and high-dose diazepam cause profound sedation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.10.048,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.10.048,Scopus,10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.10.048,2021-03-01,,,

219,Ketamine's rapid antisuicidal effects are not attenuated by Buprenorphine,"Ketamine's rapid antisuicidal action has gathered significant clinical interest in treatment of depression though concerns exist that its actions occur through the Opioid pathway. A recent study additionally reported that Naltrexone blocks antisuicidal effects of Ketamine suggesting that its antisuicidal effects are also due to opioid mechanisms. We present a case of treatment refractory depression with recent suicide attempt and active suicidal ideations who was on an Opioid partial agonist, Buprenorphine, for management of pain. Patient responded to a trial of IV ketamine treatment with rapid improvement in suicidal thoughts. Patient's suicidal ideations decreased after first Ketamine treatment and resolved after second treatment while maintained on Buprenorphine. Our finding shows that Buprenorphine does not block Ketamine's effects on suicidal ideations and therefore Ketamine treatment could be provided safely in controlled environment to those with substance use disorders or with chronic pain while being maintained on Buprenorphine. Additionally, our case suggests that non-Opioid mechanisms may be involved in Ketamine's antidepressant effects and its response to suicidal ideations in those on Opioid partial agonists.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.120,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.120,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.120,2021-03-01,,,

229,"A multi-centre, cross-sectional study on coronavirus disease 2019 in Bangladesh: clinical epidemiology and short-term outcomes in recovered individuals","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly became a global pandemic. This study aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -associated epidemiology and clinical outcomes in Bangladesh in order to understand the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic and develop approaches to prevention. A cross-sectional study based on retrospective interviews was conducted on 1021 individuals with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted in six different hospitals in Bangladesh and who recovered 4 weeks before the interview date. Of the 1021 patients, 111 (10.9%) were asymptomatic and the other 910 (89.1%) were symptomatic. Higher prevalence of COVID-19 was found in the male population (75%), in cohorts with B-positive blood group (36.3%) and in the 31–40 years age group. Common symptoms observed in our study participants were fever (72.4%), cough (55.9%), loss of taste (40.7%) and body ache (40%); whereas among the biochemical parameters, neutrophil count (46.4%), D-dimer (46.1%) and ferritin (37.9%) levels were elevated. Among the recovered individuals, short-term outcomes including pains and aches (31.8%), weakened attention span (24.4%) and anxiety or depression (23.1%) were also significantly prevalent in the symptomatic cases with comorbidities. Our study showed that in Bangladesh, adult males aged between 31 and 40 years were more vulnerable to developing COVID-19. It also indicated a rising trend of asymptomatic cases as the pandemic progressed. As a consequence, deployment of interventions to curb further spread of community infection is necessary to avoid grave outcomes of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2021.100838,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2021.100838,Scopus,10.1016/j.nmni.2021.100838,2021-03-01,,,

Methods The subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The subjects were asked to open their mouth to make “ah” sound (traditional method) or simulate yawn (improved method) for throat swab collection. The usage of tongue depressor, collection time, adverse reactions and subjective discomfort (VAS score) were compared. The collection time, comprehensive indicators of adverse reactions and VAS score were also compared among three collectors. Results The tongue depressor was less used in the improved group (χ2 = 40.186, P < 0.01). The average collection time of the traditional group was 5.44 ± 2.97 and that of the improved group was 4.00 ± 2.31 (P < 0.01). The subjects in the improved group had fewer and milder adverse reactions. The VAS score of subjects in the improved group was lower than that in the traditional group (P < 0.01). Among different collectors, the collection time, comprehensive indicators of adverse reactions and VAS were the same as the overall trend.

242,"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on critical care healthcare workers' depression, anxiety, and stress levels","Aim The aim of the study was to determine levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and factors associated with psychological burden amongst critical care healthcare workers in the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods An anonymous Web-based survey distributed in April 2020. All healthcare workers employed in a critical care setting were eligible to participate. Invitations to the survey were distributed through Australian and New Zealand critical care societies and social media platforms. The primary outcome was the proportion of healthcare workers who reported moderate to extremely severe scores on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results Of the 3770 complete responses, 3039 (80.6%) were from Australia. A total of 2871 respondents (76.2%) were women; the median age was 41 years. Nurses made up 2269 (60.2%) of respondents, with most (2029 [53.8%]) working in intensive care units. Overall, 813 (21.6%) respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, 1078 (28.6%) reported moderate to extremely severe anxiety, and 1057 (28.0%) reported moderate to extremely severe stress scores. Mean ± standard deviation values of DASS-21 depression, anxiety, and stress scores amongst woman vs men was as follows: 8.0 ± 8.2 vs 7.1 ± 8.2 (p = 0.003), 7.2 ± 7.5 vs 5.0 ± 6.7 (p < 0.001), and 14.4 ± 9.6 vs 12.5 ± 9.4 (p < 0.001), respectively. After adjusting for significant confounders, clinical concerns associated with higher DASS-21 scores included not being clinically prepared (β = 4.2, p < 0.001), an inadequate workforce (β = 2.4, p = 0.001), having to triage patients owing to lack of beds and/or equipment (β = 2.6, p = 0.001), virus transmission to friends and family (β = 2.1, p = 0.009), contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (β = 2.8, p = 0.011), being responsible for other staff members (β = 3.1, p < 0.001), and being asked to work in an area that was not in the respondents' expertise (β = 5.7, p < 0.001). Conclusion In this survey of critical care healthcare workers, between 22 and 29% of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, with women reporting higher scores than men. Although female gender appears to play a role, modifiable factors also contribute to psychological burden and should be studied further.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.12.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.12.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.aucc.2020.12.004,2021-03-01,,,

244,Impact of COVID-19 on the psychological health of university students in Spain and their attitudes toward Mobile mental health solutions,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an impact on several aspects of life, including university students’ mental health. Mobile mental care applications (apps) comprise a form of online mental care that enables the delivery of remote mental care. Objectives This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of university students in Spain and to explore their attitudes toward the use of mobile mental care apps. Method Respondents answered a survey, which comprised two sections. The first included the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) that was employed to assess the students’ mental health. The second section included six questions developed by the authors to explore the students’ attitudes toward mental care apps. Results The results showed that the students suffered from anxiety and depression as well as social dysfunction. Further, 91.3 % of the students had never used a mobile app for mental health, 36.3 % were unaware of such apps, and 79.2 % were willing to use them in the future.

247,Spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum as a rare complication of COVID-19 pneumonia: Report of 6 cases,"Spontaneous pneumothorax (SPT) and pneumomediastinum (SPM) have been reported as uncommon complications of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. The exact incidence and risk factors are still unrecognized. We report 6 nonventilated, COVID-19 pneumonia cases with SPT and SPM and their outcomes. The major risk factors for development of SPT and SPM in our patients were male gender, advance age, and pre-existing lung disease. These complications may occur in the absence of mechanical ventilation and associated with increasing morbidity (chest tube insertion, sepsis, hospital admission) and mortality. SPT and SPM should be considered as a potential predictive factor for adverse outcome and probable cause of unexplained deterioration of clinical condition in COVID-19 pneumonia.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.radcr.2021.01.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.radcr.2021.01.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.radcr.2021.01.011,2021-03-01,,,

249,"The three frontlines against COVID-19: Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raising global anxiety and fear of both real and perceived health threat from the virus. Overwhelming evidence shows infected patients experiencing neuropsychiatric complications, suggesting that the “psychoneuroimmunity” model might be beneficial in understanding the impact of the virus. Therefore, this Special Issue on “Immunopsychiatry of COVID-19 Pandemic” was launched immediately after the pandemic was declared, with the first paper accepted on the March 25th, 2020. A total of ninety-three papers were accepted, the last one was on the July 10th, 2020 when the initial acute phase started declining. The papers of this Special Issue have illuminated the social impact, psychopathology, neurological manifestation, immunity responses, and potential treatments and prevention on COVID-19. For example, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and suicidal ideation are most common psychiatric manifestations. COVID-19 infection can have central and/or peripheral nervous system symptoms, including headache, sleep disorders, encephalopathy, and loss of taste and smell. A “three-steps” Neuro-COVID infection model (neuro-invasion, clearance and immune response) was established. The current therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 include supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and plasma transfusion. Psychological support should be implemented, improving the psychological wellbeing, as well as to enhance psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.01.030,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.01.030,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2021.01.030,2021-03-01,,,

252,Psychological stresses among Chinese university students during the COVID-19 epidemic: The effect of early life adversity on emotional distress,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is leading to numerous psychological outcomes, especially emotional distress. Individuals with early life adversity (ELA) may be more susceptible to those psychological stresses during this epidemic. Aims To measure the effect of the ELA on acute stress reactions, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to examine whether specific trauma types and frequencies of exposure are associated with a more severe acute stress reaction and increased risk of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Method This investigation was performed at college students in a comprehensive University of China. The online self-report questionnaire included ELA experiences, exposure to epidemic-related events, acute stress reactions, and anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Logistic regression and stepwise regression were used to assess the associations and interactions among these variables. Results Participants with ELA reported more exposure to epidemic-related events and more severe stress reactions during the epidemics than did those with no ELA. The experience of ELA is associated with acute stress reactions, anxiety and depression in early adulthood. Furthermore, experiencing more ELA during childhood may not only increase the risk of anxiety and depression episode in early adulthood but also lead to more severe acute stress reactions during the epidemic. Conclusion Regardless of specific ELA types, ELAs have longer time effects on individual's susceptibility to stress. Under this epidemic, the mental health in young adults with ELA needs more attention.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.126,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.126,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.126,2021-03-01,,,
253,No impact of confinement during COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression in Parkinsonian patients,"Background Governments around the world have imposed varied containment measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19 infection. The psychological impact could be highly negative in patients with neurologic condition like Parkinson's Disease (PD). Methods We prospectively evaluated symptoms of depression and anxiety in 50 (26 females; mean age at 60.4) non demented Moroccan PD patients, using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), at the beginning and after 6 weeks of a full confinement. Results At the first evaluation, 28% of patients had depression while 32% had anxiety. After 6 weeks of confinement, some patients got worse and others got better scores but no significant statistical difference for both troubles was seen. Conclusion Our results show that there is no significant impact of 6 weeks of confinement on overall anxiety and depression scores. However, confinement could have an unexpected positive psychological impact on a significant number of PD patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurol.2021.01.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurol.2021.01.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.neurol.2021.01.005,2021-03-01,,,
254,COVID-19 sequelae in adults aged less than 50 years: A systematic review,"Background There is emerging evidence of long-term sequelae in a considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients after recovery and the spectrum and severity of such sequelae should be systematically reviewed. This review aims to evaluate the available evidence of all intermediate and long-term COVID-19 sequelae affecting formerly healthy adults. Methods A systematic literature search of Embase, WHO, Scopus, Pubmed, Litcovid, bioRxiv and medRxiv was conducted with a cutoff date of the 17th September 2020 according to PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020208725). Search terms included “COVID-19”, “coronavirus disease 2019”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “sequelae” and “consequence*”. Publications on adult participants, with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Elderly (>50 years old) and children (<18 years old) were excluded. Bias assessment was performed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results A total of 31 papers were included. Study types included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and case reports. Sequelae persistence since infection spanned 14 days to three months. Sequelae included persistent fatigue (39–73% of assessed persons), breathlessness (39–74%), decrease in quality of life (44–69%), impaired pulmonary function, abnormal CT findings including pulmonary fibrosis (39–83%), evidence of peri-/perimyo-/myocarditis (3–26%), changes in microstructural and functional brain integrity with persistent neurological symptoms (55%), increased incidence of psychiatric diagnoses (5.8% versus 2.5–3.4% in controls), incomplete recovery of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction (33–36% of evaluated persons). Conclusions A variety of organ systems are affected by COVID-19 in the intermediate and longer-term after recovery. Main sequelae include post-infectious fatigue, persistent reduced lung function and carditis. Careful follow-up post COVID 19 is indicated to assess and mitigate possible organ damage and preserve life quality.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2021.101995,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2021.101995,Scopus,10.1016/j.tmaid.2021.101995,2021-03-01,,,

256,Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis in Paris: A differential psychological impact between regular intensive care unit staff members and reinforcement workers,"Background Intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To overcome the lack of human resources during this crisis, some ICUs had to mobilise staff from a reinforcement pool, with no or outdated ICU experience. This study aimed to investigate and to compare the psychological impact of the pandemic on regular ICU staff members and reinforcement workers. Material and methods Self-assessment questionnaires were completed by HCWs who worked from March 1 to April 30, 2020, in our 16-bed neurological ICU at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, France, which was converted to a COVID ICU. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire-Revised, and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to assess anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, quality of life, and resilience, respectively. Results Sixty-nine ICU HCWs completed the survey (37 from the team of regular staff members, i.e., from the public health service, and 32 from a reinforcement pool, either from non-ICU public health service or from private healthcare interim employment agencies). Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms was high, at 19%, 9%, and 16%, respectively, with limited impairment in quality of life or resilience scores. Depression symptoms were observed more in regular staff members than in welcomed reinforcement workers, at 16% and 0%, respectively. Conclusions These results revealed that during the pandemic, HCWs from the team of regular staff members were at greater risk of developing psychological disorder compared with reinforcement workers, with higher levels of depressive symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.11.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.11.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.aucc.2020.11.005,2021-03-01,,,
257,The role of only-child status in the psychological impact of COVID-19 on mental health of Chinese adolescents,"Background The impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on public mental health in 2019 is verified, but the role of only-child status in the mental health of adolescents confined at home during the COVID-19 epidemic has not been investigated and is not clear. Objective Our study aims to assess the impact of only-child status on the mental health of adolescents confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The exposure risk to COVID-19, adverse experience, parent-child relationship, and resilience have also been measured and considered. Methods From March 20 to 31, 2020, a cross-sectional survey test was conducted on 11,681 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years in middle schools (Grade 7 to Grade 9) across five provinces in China. The self-reported online questionnarie was used to collected data of demographic information, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the exposure risk to COVID-19. Results A total of 11,180 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective rate of 95.7%. 35.2% of only children and 38.8% of non-only children reported depression symptoms, while 20.5% of only children and 24.7% of non-only children reported anxiety symptoms. It was significant that non-only children were more likely to have anxiety and depression symptoms than only children (OR = 1.164, 95%CI: 1.064–1.273, p = 0.001). The risk of exposure to COVID-19 was a risk factor of depression (OR = 2.284, 95%CI: 1.640–3.180, p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.959, 95%CI: 1.402–2.737, p < 0.001) in non-only children, but not in only children. For both only children and non-only children, the resilience and parent-child relationship were protective factors of depression and anxiety symptoms, while emotional abuse was a risk factor (p < 0.001). Conclusion The non-only children are more likely to develop the symptoms of anxiety and depression than only children, during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The adolescents with siblings are psychiatrically more vulnerable to exposure risk of COVID-19 and need more attention, especially those with poor parent-child relationship, low resilience and experience of emotional abuse.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.113,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.113,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.113,2021-03-01,,,

To better know the differences in the mental health status between frontier-line and non-frontier-line medical staff. This study used the Child PTSD Symptom Scale, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale to examine the PTSD, depression, anxiety and resilience among 162 frontier-line medical workers and 163 non-frontier-line medical workers in China. The results showed that all negative factor scores of non-frontier-line medical staff seemed to be worse than those of frontier-line medical staff, and the positive factor scores were the opposite through descriptive analysis, independent sample t-test and Chi-square test.

259,Unprecedented need and recommendations for harnessing data to guide future policy and practice for opioid use disorder treatment following COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic struck in the midst of an ongoing opioid epidemic. To offset disruption to life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), several federal agencies granted exemptions to existing federal regulations. This included loosening restrictions on medications for OUD (MOUD), including methadone and buprenorphine. In this commentary, we briefly review policy and practice guidelines for treating OUD prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We then outline specific MOUD treatment policy and practice exemptions that went into effect in February and March 2020, and discuss the ways in which these unprecedented changes have dramatically changed MOUD treatment. Given the unprecedented nature of these changes, and unknown outcomes to date, we advocate for a data-driven approach to guide future policy and practice recommendations regarding MOUD.

This study aimed to obtain a more detailed understanding of the current mental health needs of these individuals, which is important for both the development of intervention strategies to better manage patient distress and to better prepare for similar circumstances in future. Methods The sample comprised 43 individuals with a verified diagnosis of BD and 24 healthy controls. Data about pandemic-related mental health support use, socio-demographics, mood, lifestyle, social rhythm and subjective cognitive dysfunction data were collected and compared between groups. Inter-relationships between scores were also examined. Results No between-group differences were found in terms of age, sex, living situation, job loss or reduced work hours due to COVID-19. Most patients with BD reported a history of ongoing formal psychological support (68.3%), with most continuing this support throughout the pandemic (82.1%). A large, statistically significant pandemic-related increase in subjective cognitive dysfunction was evident in the BD group. Subjective cognitive dysfunction was significantly associated with negative symptomology, suicidal thoughts, and quality of life ratings. Limitations Data was collected in self-report format in an online survey and objective symptom measures were not used at this time Conclusion The absenceof substantial differences between patients and controls in terms of mood symptoms, COVID-19 fear or lifestyle factors and social rhythms suggests a degree of resilience in BD patients; despite large pandemic related increases in subjective cognitive dysfunction.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.186,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.186,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.186,2021-03-01,,,

Methods A structured questionnaire investigating different aspects of the lives and psychosocial well-being of PWE during the COVID-19 pandemic was developed. Persons with epilepsy were invited via social media to anonymously respond to a secure web-based online questionnaire (www.icpcovid.com). Responses were collected between July 26th and December 3rd, 2020. Hospital anxiety and depression scales (HADS) were used to screen respondents for depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A). Results Responses of 407 PWE were included in the analysis; 304 (74.7%) respondents were female and 245 (60.2%) living in Europe, 157 (38.6%) in South America, and 5 (1.2%) in Canada. Seventy-six (18.7%) reported a decrease of income during the COVID-19 lockdown, and 122 (30.0%) experienced difficulties in obtaining anti-seizure medication (ASM), mostly (72/122, 59.0%) due to unavailability. Seizure frequency increased in 122 (30.0%); 295 (72.5%) screened positive for anxiety, and 159 (39.1%) for depression. Hundred eighty-eight (46.2%) reported reluctance to seek medical care; 27.3% believed that epilepsy was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 disease. Forty-six (74.2%) of 62 PWE who were followed up by telephone or video consult were satisfied with this consult. Fifty-five respondents, most (89.1%) of whom were from Europe, had also participated in a previous survey during the early months of the pandemic. In this subgroup, although there was no difference in prevalence of a positive screening for depression or anxiety, mean scores on HADS-A and HADS-D increased from 6.65 ± 3.99 to 7.27 ± 4.01 (p = 0.418), and from 5.84 ± 4.43 to 6.60 ± 4.45 (p = 0.371), respectively. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the psychosocial and somatic well-being of PWE. To minimize this impact, ensuring uninterrupted access to ASM is essential. Teleconsultations are valid alternatives for continued follow-up, but should include attention to psychosocial well-being. Persons with epilepsy should be more actively informed that epilepsy is not a risk factor for developing (more severe) COVID-19 disease.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107800,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107800,Scopus,10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107800,2021-03-01,,,
272,Correlation between depressive symptoms and sexual dysfunction in postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective To evaluate the relation between sexual function and depressive symptoms in puerperal women during the pandemic period. Study design Prospective cohort with 125 women evaluated in the immediate postpartum period (before the pandemic - T1) in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, 3 months (pandemic onset - T2) and 6 months (pandemic peak - T3) after birth by email and WhatsApp. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were applied. Results Fifty puerperal women participated in the three periods of the study. The median age was 25 years. There was an inverse correlation between the ​​ FSFI and EPDS values at T2 (p < 0.001) and T3 (p < 0.001), demonstrating that the worsening sexual response was secondary to the higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in the puerperium in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an increase in EPDS scores in the three periods: at T1, the EPDS scores ​​were 5.0 (2.0−9.0), increasing to 7.0 (4.0−14.0) at T2 and 6.5 (3.0−13.0) at T3 (p = 0.004). There was no difference between the FSFI index at the three evaluated times. Conclusions Puerperal women are a susceptible subgroup for sexual dysfunction and depressive symptoms, which are correlated to each other and worsen in periods of stress, therefore, it is mandatory to investigate depressive symptoms in puerperal women with sexual complaints, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.12.039,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.12.039,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.12.039,2021-03-01,,,

277,NO<inf>2</inf> levels as a contributing factor to COVID-19 deaths: The first empirical estimate of threshold values,"This study represents the first empirical estimation of threshold values between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and COVID-19-related deaths in France. The concentration of NO2 linked to COVID-19-related deaths in three major French cities were determined using Artificial Neural Networks experiments and a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of NO2 in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that NO2, as a precursor to secondary particulate matter formation, can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. Three different neural networks for the cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille were built in this work, followed by the application of an innovative tool of cutting the signal from the inputs to the selected target. The results show that the threshold levels of NO2 connected to COVID-19 range between 15.8 μg/m3 for Lyon, 21.8 μg/m3 for Marseille and 22.9 μg/m3 for Paris, which were significantly lower than the average annual concentration limit of 40 μg/m³ imposed by Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663,Scopus,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663,2021-03-01,,,

279,Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the serum prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with biologic drugs,"Background Patients receiving biologic therapies are at risk for viral infections. This study investigated the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the serum prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with biologic drugs. Methods Information on demography, co-morbidities, clinical data regarding IBD, symptoms suggestive of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, close contacts with SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, hospitalization, and therapies administered for COVID-19 was collected for all patients who were being treated with biologic drugs. All patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Results Two hundred and fifty-nine patients (27 children) with a mean age of 42.2 ± 16.7 years (range 9 - 88) and a mean duration of disease of 13.4 ± 10 years (range 0.2 – 49) were enrolled. One hundred four patients (40.2%) had ulcerative colitis, and 155 (59.8%) had Crohn's disease. About the therapy: 62 patients were receiving infliximab, 89 adalimumab, 20 golimumab, 57 vedolizumab, 27 ustekinumab, 1 thalidomide, and 3 an experimental compound. The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2. Thirty-two patients (12.3%) reported respiratory symptoms, and 2 of them were hospitalized (0.77%).

280,"Post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in caregivers of children tested for COVID-19 in the acute phase of the Italian outbreak","Background The recent COVID-19 pandemic pointed out new burdens for researchers on mental health and that evidence-based (EB) studies on vulnerable populations are timely needed. The present paper aims at analysing the impact of suspicious of SARS-COV-2 infection in a cohort of parents presented at 3 major hospitals (spread between north and center of Italy) during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic phase 1. Methods Participants of the present cross-sectional, multicenter study were parental couples of children suspected to have COVID-19 who underwent testing with nasopharyngeal swabbing. All subjects were assessed by means of the: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in order to evaluate Post-traumatic stress (PTSS), anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively. Outcomes Results evidenced that parents whose children tested positive for COVID-19 were more prone to developing PTSS, anxiety and depressive symptoms. The same results emerged for parents who had quarantined as opposed to those who had not. Moreover, patients who suffered economic damage showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas PTSS was more common among unemployed subjects and among mothers. Interpretation This study identified a mental health strain represented by parenting a child who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further EB research is needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and related psychiatric symptoms in caregivers of COVID-19 infected children during the next phases of the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.024,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.024,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.024,2021-03-01,,,
281,Potential predictors of depressive symptoms during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak among Brazilian adults,"Background In early 2020, Sars-Cov-2 was identified in China as a new coronavirus. Due to its transmission, Sars-Cov-2 has spread rapidly across the world. In the early stage of the disease outbreak, psychiatric symptoms have been reported, including depressive symptoms. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in quarantine and its association with sociodemographic variables and known protective factors for depression, such as spirituality, social support, resilience, and quality of life. Methods A cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was distributed via social media. The instruments consisted of the 8-item EUROHIS-QOL, PHQ-9, Social Support Questionnaire, WHOQoL-SRPB, and CD-RISC. Results A total of 3,274 participants were included in this study. 23.67% of the participants met the criteria for a depressive episode. Higher age, spirituality, social support, resiliency, and quality of life were associated with less depressive symptoms. Quarantine length; mental health treatment; chronic disease; age; sex; lower levels of spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, physical exercise, and education; and unpaid occupation were found to be predictors of depressive symptoms during COVID-19 quarantine. Limitations The data are limited to the pandemic initial period, the sample isn't random and the use of self-reported questionnaires are some limitations of our study. Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil, quarantine time, treatment for mental health, chronic illness, lower levels of education, and unpaid occupation were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Age, sex, spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, and physical exercise showed a negative relationship with depressive symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.203,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.203,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.203,2021-03-01,,,

284,Sooner than you think: A very early affective reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine in Argentina,"The unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic pose serious challenges to mood stability and emotional regulation at all ages. Although many people tend to react resiliently to stress, others appear to display emotional anxiety and depression-related symptoms. In this study, we carried out a survey (N = 10,053) during the first week of the general lockdown (quarantine) in Argentina to measure early affective reactions in Argentine adults. Respondents showed substantial anxious and depressive symptoms, with 33% and 23% of participants reporting possible depressive and anxious syndromes, respectively, with the youngest group (18 to 25 y.o.) showing the highest prevalence of symptoms. Even if prior mental health problems predisposed or aggravated the reaction, participants without prior complaints showed signs of psychological impact. Using linear regression, the most important independent variables related to depressive symptoms were the feeling of loneliness followed by daily stress. In the case of anxious states, the strongest variables were negative repetitive thinking and feeling of loneliness. Other psychological, economic, and social factors are discussed. This study is in line with previous literature that highlight the importance of the psychological impact of pandemics, but additionally demonstrates that these reactions are present at a large scale immediately after the start of quarantine with very low infectious rates as an early anticipatory adaptive reaction leading to potential negative outcomes from adjustment disorders to major disorders. In addition, the present results provide potentially relevant information about sudden environmental impacts on affective states and specific pathways for anxiety and depression to be expressed. We end by discussing implications for public policy based on considering the most vulnerable groups.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.124,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.124,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.124,2021-03-01,,,

Close to 75% of participants reported an improvement in a smartphone related skill, and the majority of participants that reported improvement in one skill reported improvement in at least one other. Qualitative feedback from participants suggests how digital competencies acquired were used to immediately support functional outcomes. Objective To improve functional outcomes in patients with serious mental illness through a multi-session curriculum designed to improve smartphone skills and engage participants in group learning and problem solving, targeting negative and cognitive symptoms of illness. Methods An eight-week smartphone digital competencies and skills course was offered to two distinct groups of youth with serious mental illness. Pre and post self-report measurements were captured for each participant for each session. Results Group participation varied by session, but overall 28 unique patients attended. From survey results, 75% reported improvement in smartphone related skills because of the groups. Qualitative feedback suggests how skills acquired by patients were immediately utilized to gain insight into health and support functional outcomes. Conclusions and implications for practice Smartphone skills groups are a means to provide practical psychiatric rehabilitation that may enable some patients to compensate for cognitive and social deficits due to illness. While ensuring groups are responsive to patients with varying degrees of skills remains a challenge, adapting lesson structures and mediums, as well as creating new measurement tools, offers a means to modify the course with the clinical need.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100366,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100366,Scopus,10.1016/j.invent.2021.100366,2021-03-01,,,

291,"Pyometra Management Practices in the High Quality, High Volume Spay-Neuter Environment","Pyometra management in the high quality, high volume spay-neuter (HQHVSN) environment is not well documented. The goal of this study was to identify pyometra management practices and patient outcomes in the HQHVSN environment. An electronic survey was piloted and distributed to HQHVSN clinics using Survey Monkey via email lists and social media. A total of 118 responses were received from June to July 2020. Respondents were distributed across the United States with the majority of clinics associated with a shelter (75%). Clinics performed a median of 25 spays and neuters per day and 5000 per year. Most clinics (86%) were willing to treat nonincidental pyometras at least sometimes, and nearly all of these clinics (97%) were willing to accept pyometra referrals. Of these clinics, nearly all (95%) felt they had the necessary resources to treat most pyometras that presented and that a pyometra case was only modestly disruptive to their surgery flow. Most clinics (70%) charged a fee for treatment, charging a median of $200 for dogs and $125 for cats. This is much lower as compared to the estimated ranges for private practice ($600-$2500) and emergency hospitals ($1500-$3579). The majority of patients that HQHVSN clinics accepted for treatment were seen the same day (50%) or next day (42%). These clinics estimated that of the animals who presented, 76% were BAR or QAR, 20% were depressed or nonambulatory, and 4% were obtunded and lateral. Estimated survival for these treated groups were 98%, 80%, and 38%, respectively. HQHVSN clinics may represent a resource for treating pyometras when treatment is disruptive to the schedule of a private practice or clients present with financial limitations. There is an opportunity for HQHVSN and private practice to form a partnership to leverage the strengths of both models and improve access to care for pets.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2020.100499,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2020.100499,Scopus,10.1016/j.tcam.2020.100499,2021-03-01,,,
292,Anxiety and depression due to 2019 SARS-CoV-2 among frontier healthcare workers in Kenya,"Background The novel coronavirus disease continues to spread across the globe, causing anxiety and depression among healthcare workers. Objectives The current study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and depression due to the coronavirus pandemic among healthcare workers in Kenya. Methods A total sample of 476 respondents participated. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Patient-Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), together with a socio-demographic questionnaire, were applied. Stratified sampling was used. Data was analysed using the Statistical Package Programme for Social Science Version 23.0.0. Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were employed to establish the differences in levels of anxiety and depression across socio-demographic characteristics. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to establish the predictors of levels of anxiety and depression, and associations were considered significant at p < 0.05. Results A total of 35.1% (n = 167) of the participants had mild anxiety, and 13.4% (n = 64) severe anxiety. Approximately 53.6% (n = 255) had mild depression while 9.2% (n = 44) had severe depression. The univariate analysis illustrated a statistical difference in anxiety levels in gender (p > 0.027), years of work experience (p = 0.005), and the cadre of respondents (p = 0.0028). Gender was statistically significant with the level of depression (p = 0.045). About 62.6% (n = 298) of healthcare workers had been trained, and only 9% (n = 43) were confident in managing COVID-19 cases. A large proportion, 98% (n = 458) had concerns about the availability of personal protective equipment. Conclusion The study findings indicated that the majority of healthcare workers had mild anxiety and depression. Female healthcare workers were more likely to experience severe anxiety and depression.

293,Association between psychological resilience and changes in mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background Psychological responses to potentially traumatic events tend to be heterogeneous, with some individuals displaying resilience. Longitudinal associations between resilience and mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to examine the association between resilience and trajectories of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Participants were 6,008 adults from the Understanding America Study, a probability-based Internet-panel representative of the US adult population. Baseline data were collected between March 10 and March 31, 2020, with nine follow-up waves conducted between April 1 and August 4. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to examine the association between date and mental distress, stratified by resilience level (low, normal, or high). Results In contrast to the high resilience group, participants in the low and normal resilience groups experienced increases in mental distress in the early months of the pandemic (low: OR=2.94, 95% CI=1.93-4.46; normal: OR=1.91, 95% CI=1.55-2.35). Men, middle-aged and older adults, Black adults, and adults with a graduate degree were more likely to report high resilience, whereas adults living below the poverty line were less likely to report high resilience. Limitations These associations should not be interpreted as causal, and resilience was measured at only one time-point. Conclusions Trajectories of mental distress varied markedly by resilience level during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with low-resilience adults reporting the largest increases in mental distress during this crisis. Activities that foster resilience should be included in broader strategies to support mental health throughout the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.071,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.071,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.071,2021-03-01,,,

The prevalence of depression during the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in prenatal and postnatal women was examined in China. Methods 2201 prenatal and postnatal women in mainland China were recruited in this cross-sectional study from February 28th to April 26th, 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression in prenatal and postnatal women. Results The prevalence rate of depression was 35.4%. The risk factors for depression included drinking (p = 0.04; adjusted OR = 2.81, 95%CI: 1.26~6.24), nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 3.54, 95%CI: 1.10~11.44), pregnancy's influence on mobility (p = 0.02; adjusted OR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.11~1.83), anxiety (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.57~1.75), insomnia (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.14~1.21) and daily attention to fetal movement (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.31~0.56). Limitations This study used a cross-sectional design, and cannot compare changes in the incidence of depression before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions During the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence rate of depression among Chinese prenatal and postnatal women was 35.4%. Moreover, anxiety, insomnia, drinking, nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, as well as the impaired movement and less daily monitoring of fetal movement were risk factors for depression.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.019,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.019,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.019,2021-03-01,,,

297,"A longitudinal study on clinically relevant self-reported depression, anxiety and acute stress features among Italian community-dwelling adults during the COVID-19 related lockdown: Evidence of a predictive role for baseline dysfunctional personality dimensions","Background: Although necessary for public health, quarantine has been documented to cause post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression. We designed the present longitudinal study to evaluate the psychological impact of quarantine in Italian community-dwelling adult participants. Methods: A sample of 304 Italian community-dwelling adult participants (75.7% female; mean age = 35.28 years) was administered self-reported measures of depression, anxiety and acute stress symptoms at the beginning and at the end of the lockdown. Potential predictors of clinically relevant symptoms at the end of the lockdown were assessed. Specifically, data on gender, civil status, education level, occupation, and area of residence, as well as maladaptive personality domains were collected. Results: More than 43% of participants suffered from the early impact of the lockdown; at the end of the lockdown roughly 32% of participants still reported any clinically relevant depression anxiety, and/or acute stress disorder condition. Clinically relevant acute stress reaction at the beginning of lockdown was a particularly important risk factor for experiencing clinically relevant acute stress, depression, and anxiety at the end of the lockdown. Maladaptive personality domains represent non-trivial predictors of participants’ self-reports of clinically relevant depression, anxiety, and acute stress conditions at the end of the lockdown. Limitations: Excess of female participants and the impossibility of evaluating if participants suffered from any internalizing disorder before the COVID-19 quarantine represent major limitations of our study. Conclusions: Our findings suggest assessment of internalizing disorder symptoms during quarantine may be helpful in identifying people who may benefit from early treatment interventions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.165,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.165,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.165,2021-03-01,,,

299,Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on nurses’ mental health: A prospective cohort study,"Objectives To evaluate variations in nurses’ sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to evaluate whether the presence of potential risk factors influenced these symptoms over time. Methods This prospective cohort study surveyed nurses three times – surveying personal factors, working conditions, family dynamics, and attitude towards COVID-19 – between March 31 and May 4, 2020. Nurses’ mental health was assessed through Depression Anxiety Stress Scales – short version (DASS-21); their sleep quality was assessed through a 5-point Likert scale question. Results Nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress presented a positive variation over the COVID-19 outbreak. The only factors which are directly related to the COVID-19 outbreak and that were associated with the positive variation in nurses’ symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were the fear to infect others and the fear to be infected (higher fear of being infected or to infect someone corresponded to increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress). Conclusions Although the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have had an immediate impact on nurses' mental health, a psychological adaptation phenomenon was also observed. Future research should focus on assessing nurses’ symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, after the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to compare and contrast the findings with the results of our study.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110620,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110620,Scopus,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110620,2021-03-01,,,
300,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in a cohort of myasthenia gravis patients in India,"Objective Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness due to immune mediated damage of acetylcholine receptor (AchR). COVID-19 infection, mental stress and non-availability of drugs following lockdown may worsen myasthenic symptoms. We report the impact of COVID 19, and lockdown on the physical and mental health, and quality of sleep in a cohort of MG. Methods Thirty-eight MG patients were telephonically interviewed 2months after the declaration of lockdown in India. The difficulty in procuring drugs, complications, and worsening in the MG Foundation of America (MGFA) stage were noted. The patients were enquired about MG Quality of Life 15 (MGQOL15), MG Activity of Daily Living (MGADL), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) using a prefixed questionnaire. Their pre-COVID parameters were retrieved from our earlier trial data, which was completed 4months back. The scores of the above mentioned parameters before and after COVID were compared. Results Their median age was 45 years, and the median duration of treatment for MG was 4.5years. Eleven (28.9 %) patients were hypertensive and 3(7.9 %) diabetic. All were on prednisolone and 18(47.4 %) received azathioprine. None developed COVID, but three had other infections. Two patients needed hospitalization because of wrong medication in one and severe anxiety-insomnia in another.

303,Anxiety and Depression Associated with the Management of COVID-19 Among Healthcare workers in Cameroon,"Objectif La pandémie de la COVID-19 a eu un retentissement important dans le monde, à différents niveaux. La littérature consultée indique que les travailleurs de santé, en première ligne de la riposte, sont généralement ceux qui paient le plus lourd tribu. La présente étude évalue l’importance des symptomatologies anxieuse et dépressive chez ces acteurs de la riposte à la COVID-19, dans le contexte du Cameroun. Méthode La Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) a été mise à contribution pour évaluer les symptomatologies anxieuse et dépressive. La collecte des données a eu recours à la construction d’un web questionnaire sur la plateforme Google Forms. Le lien du questionnaire a été envoyé à des groupes professionnels dans les 10 Régions du pays, au préalable de leur consentement éclairé. Au total, 331 professionnels de santé ont été interrogés sur la période du 05 au 19 avril 2020. Résultats Les résultats montrent un taux important d’anxiété (41,8 %) et de dépression (42,8 %). On observe une plus forte susceptibilité à la dépression chez les sujets jeunes (30-39 ans). La peur de la contamination et la peur de la mort sont des facteurs modulateurs de la dépression et de l’anxiété. La comorbidité anxiété-dépression dans l’échantillon est de 14,73 %. Les taux de prévalence du trouble dépressif majeur et du trouble de l’adaptation dans l’échantillon sont respectivement de 8,2 % et 3,3 %. Les données présentées confirment les tendances enregistrées dans la littérature, concernant l’impact des épidémies mortelles sur la santé mentale des travailleurs de santé. Discussion Les résultats indiquent, comme c’est le cas dans la plupart des travaux consultés dans la littérature, que la pandémie de la Covid 19 affecte de manière importante la santé mentale des travailleurs de santé. Ceci souligne l’urgence de mettre en place un dispositif d’aide et/ou d’accompagnement spécialisé, dans le contexte de l’actuelle pandémie, comme celui des crises sanitaires de même nature. Un tel dispositif n’existe pas au Cameroun, où la réponse de santé mentale reste faible. Conclusion Ces résultats suggèrent que les personnels de santé engagés dans la riposte contre la COVID-19 au Cameroun sont affectés de manière significative dans leur santé mentale. Ce qui souligne la nécessité d’une aide psychologique spécialisée pour le personnel soignant. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. Method The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. Result The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. Discussion The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and/or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. Conclusion These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health. This underlines the need for specialized psychological help for nursing staff.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.evopsy.2020.11.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.evopsy.2020.11.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.evopsy.2020.11.002,2021-03-01,,,
304,Is necessity also the mother of implementation? COVID-19 and the implementation of evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorders,"Opioid-related overdoses and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represent two of the deadliest crises in United States' history and together constitute a syndemic. The intersecting risks of this syndemic underscore the urgent need to implement effective opioid use disorder (OUD) treatments that are sustainable amid COVID-19 mitigation strategies. In response to new federal guidance released during the pandemic, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) have quickly innovated to implement new systems of medication delivery. OTPs rapid implementation of new medication delivery models defies conventional wisdom about the pace of research transfer. As part of an ongoing cluster-randomized type 3 hybrid trial evaluating strategies to implement contingency management (CM), select staff of eight OTPs had been trained to deliver CM and were in the midst of receiving ongoing implementation support. As COVID-19 emerged, all eight OTPs mirrored trends in the addiction field and effectively adapted to federal/state demands to implement new methods of medication delivery. However, over the past few months, necessity has arguably been the mother of implementation. We have observed greater variance among these OTPs' success with the additional implementation of adjunctive CM. The speed and variability of innovation raises novel questions about drivers of implementation. We argue that the mother of the next innovation should be a public call for a progressive, thoughtful set of public health policies and other external setting levers to address the needs of those with OUD and the OTPs that serve them.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108210,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108210,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108210,2021-03-01,,,

306,Prevalence and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (COVID-D): a multicentre cohort study,"Background To date, 750 000 patients with COVID-19 worldwide have required mechanical ventilation and thus are at high risk of acute brain dysfunction (coma and delirium). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae. Methods This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression. Findings Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40·0 (30·0 to 53·0). 1397 (66·9%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87·5%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64·0%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 12·0) and 1481 (70·9%) were given propofol for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 11·0). Median Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was –4 (–5 to –3). 1704 (81·6%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10·0 days (6·0 to 15·0) and 1147 (54·9%) were delirious for a median of 3·0 days (2·0 to 6·0). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p≤0·04), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p<0·0001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5·0 days (0·0 to 14·0). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p<0·01). 601 (28·8%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU. Interpretation Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Benzodiazepine use and lack of family visitation were identified as modifiable risk factors for delirium, and thus these data present an opportunity to reduce acute brain dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.

308,Low uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviours and high socioeconomic impact of lockdown measures in South Asia: Evidence from a large-scale multi-country surveillance programme,"Background South Asia has become a major epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding South Asians’ awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region. Methods We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries. Data were collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative. Results Participants were 61% female, mean age 45.1 years. Almost half had one or more chronic disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Knowledge of the primary COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%). Key preventive measures were not widely adopted. Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to long-term medications; 40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression. The prevalence of unemployment rose from 9.3% to 39.4% (P < 0.001), and household income fell by 52% (P < 0.001) during the lockdown. Younger people and those from less affluent socio-economic groups were most severely impacted. Sedentary time increased by 32% and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake increased by 10% (P < 0.001 for both), while tobacco and alcohol consumption dropped by 41% and 80%, respectively (P < 0.001), during the lockdown. Conclusions Our results identified important knowledge, access and uptake barriers to the prevention of COVID-19 in South Asia, and demonstrated major adverse impacts of the pandemic on chronic disease treatment, mental health, health-related behaviours, employment and household finances. We found important sociodemographic differences for impact, suggesting a widening of existing inequalities. Our findings underscore the need for immediate large-scale action to close gaps in knowledge and access to essential resources for prevention, along with measures to safeguard economic production and mitigate socio-economic impacts on the young and the poor.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100751,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100751,Scopus,10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100751,2021-03-01,,,

313,Psychological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on the staff of a French hospital,"Background The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among hospital staff. The factors associated with this psychological impact remain to be determined. Methods A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire completed by the staff of a French hospital, two months after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Results Among the 353 participants (of whom 67% were healthcare professionals), 32% had symptoms of anxiety, 16% of depression and 16% of PTSD. Eleven per cent had initiated or increased treatment with sleeping pills, and 6% with anxiolytics. In a multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with anxiety were: change of professional team, having a relative infected by SARS-CoV-2 and a new/increased treatment with sleeping pills or anxiolytics. The only factor associated with depression was the feeling of risk during professional practice. The factors associated with PTSD were: having a relative infected by SARS-CoV-2, the feeling of risk during professional practice, the increase in smoking and treatment with sleeping pills. The observance of transmission preventive measures (TPM) was not associated with the psychological impact of SARS-CoV-2. A personal history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and age<36 years were associated with insufficient use of protective equipment. Age<36 years, and being a healthcare professional were associated with the non-observance of social distancing. Conclusion The hospital staff displayed psychological consequences, resulting in the use of anxiolytics and sleeping pills. Belonging to a group with low-risk of severe disease was associated with lower observance of TPM.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2021.01.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2021.01.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.idnow.2021.01.007,2021-03-01,,,

323,COVID-19 and mental health during pregnancy: The importance of cognitive appraisal and social support,"Background Pregnancy is a period of elevated risk for mental health difficulties, which are likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to understand the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and identify risk and protective factors during pregnancy. Methods Participants were 303 pregnant individuals from Ontario, Canada. Depression, anxiety and insomnia were measured using validated questionnaires. COVID-related experiences (i.e., financial difficulties, relationship conflict, social isolation) were assessed in relation to mental health. Social support and cognitive appraisal of the pandemic were examined as protective factors. Results 57% of the sample reported clinically elevated depression, >30% reported elevated worries, and 19% reported elevated insomnia. Depression (t = 25.14, p < .0001) and anxiety (t = 17.21, p < .0001) levels were higher than non-COVID pregnant samples. Social isolation, financial trouble, relationship difficulties and threat of COVID-19 were associated with mental health. Social support (rrange −.24 to −.38, p <.01) was associated with lower mental health problems and negative cognitive appraisal (rrange .20 to .33, p <.01) was linked to more mental health problems. Furthermore, social support and cognitive appraisal interacted (β = -.92, SE = .41, p < .05), such that higher social support acted as a protective factor, particularly for those who appraise the impact of COVID-19 to be more negative. Conclusions Findings underscore the need to address the high rates of mental health during pregnancy and outline potential targets (cognitive appraisal and social support) to protect pregnant people from experiencing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.027,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.027,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.027,2021-03-01,,,
324,"The effect of Emotional Freedom Techniques on nurses' stress, anxiety, and burnout levels during the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled trial","Background and Objective Infectious disease outbreaks pose psychological challenges to the general population, and especially to healthcare workers. Nurses who work with COVID-19 patients are particularly vulnerable to emotions such as fear and anxiety, due to fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness related to their high intensity work. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a brief online form of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) in the prevention of stress, anxiety, and burnout in nurses involved in the treatment of COVID patients. Methods The study is a randomized controlled trial. It complies with the guidelines prescribed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. It was conducted in a COVID-19 department at a university hospital in Turkey. We recruited nurses who care for patients infected with COVID-19 and randomly allocated them into an intervention group (n = 35) and a no-treatment control group (n = 37). The intervention group received one guided online group EFT session. Results Reductions in stress (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), and burnout (p < .001) reached high levels of statistical significance for the intervention group. The control group showed no statistically significant changes on these measures (p > .05).

325,Prevalence and correlates of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic and the major role of stigmatization in low- and middle-income countries: A multinational cross-sectional study,"Objectives Currently, there is little data on the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to examine the pooled and separate prevalence and determinants of depression during the pandemic in samples from four LMICs. Methods Participants (N= 1267, 40.9% women) were recruited from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo. They completed an online cross-sectional survey on sociodemographics, exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression subscale, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2. Results The pooled prevalence for depression symptoms was 24.3% (95% CI: 22.08-26.79%), with significant differences across countries. Younger age, gender (women), and high levels of exposure and stigmatization related to COVIID-19, and resilience were associated with depression in the pooled data. There were significant variations at the country level. Stigmatization (but not exposure to COVID-19 and resilience) was a strong predictor among the four countries. Conclusions The prevalence of depression symptoms in the LMICs are similar to those reported in China and in most high-income countries during the pandemic. The findings emphasize the need for implementing non-fear-based education programs during epidemics to reduce stigmatization.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113714,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113714,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113714,2021-03-01,,,

334,Suicidal Ideation Among Individuals Who Have Purchased Firearms During COVID-19,"Introduction Given the increase in firearm purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study seeks to determine the extent to which COVID-19 firearm purchasers differ in terms of suicide risk from nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. Methods Participants (N=3,500) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels to participate in an online survey examining methods for self-protection. ANCOVAs were utilized to assess suicidal ideation. Multivariate ANCOVAs were used to examine firearm storage practices and storage changes during COVID-19. Data were collected in late June and early July 2020, and analyses were conducted in July 2020. Results Individuals who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 more frequently reported lifetime, past-year, and past-month suicidal ideation than nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. COVID-19 purchasers with lifetime ideation were less likely to hide loaded firearms in a closet than those without lifetime ideation. COVID-19 purchasers with past-year or past-month ideation were more likely to use locking devices than COVID-19 purchasers without past-month ideation. Conclusions In contrast to firearm owners more generally, COVID-19 firearm purchasers appear far more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and appear less likely to use certain unsafe firearm storage methods but also report a greater number of storage changes during COVID-19 that made firearms less secure. Future research should seek to further understand those who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 and determine ways to increase secure storage among firearm owners.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.013,2021-03-01,,,
335,"Suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown in Greece: Prevalence in the community, risk and protective factors","The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the community as well as the risk and protective factors of suicidal ideation during restriction measures in Greece, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Α web-based anonymous survey was conducted during the first lockdown period. Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation (SCORE-15), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISK-2), and a self-report questionnaire for COVID-19 pandemic-related data. From a total of 5,116 adults included in the study, 5.20% reported suicidal thoughts, 14.17% were potential clinical cases of anxiety, and 26.51% of depression. Participants presented significantly higher suicidal ideation rates during the last two weeks of the lockdown compared to its previous two weeks. Unmarried or divorced marital status, mental health history, poor perceived quality of physical health, impaired family functioning, anxiety and depression symptoms were independently associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation, whereas higher resilience, positive feelings with regard to the lockdown measures, relationship with friends, and faith in a Supreme Being were associated with lower suicidal ideation odds. According to the findings, suicidal ideation prevalence might be considered elevated and its increase during the lockdown period alarming. The risk and protective factors identified in the study offer valuable information for the development of preventive strategies against suicidal ideation, especially in times of crisis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113713,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113713,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113713,2021-03-01,,,

338,Impact of a shelter-in-place order during the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdoses,"Introduction Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, there have been concerns about the potential impact of the pandemic on persons with opioid use disorder. Shelter-in-place (SIP) orders, which aimed to reduce the spread and scope of the virus, likely also impacted this patient population. This study aims to assess the role of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdose before and after a SIP order. Methods A retrospective review of the incidence of opioid overdoses in an urban three-hospital system was conducted. Comparisons were made between the first 100 days of a city-wide SIP order during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 100 days during the COVID-19 pandemic preceding the SIP order (Pre-SIP). Differences in observed incidence and expected incidence during the SIP period were evaluated using a Fisher's Exact test. Results Total patient visits decreased 22% from 46,078 during the Pre-SIP period to 35,971 during the SIP period. A total of 1551 opioid overdoses were evaluated during the SIP period, compared to 1665 opioid overdoses during the Pre-SIP period, consistent with a 6.8% decline. A Fisher's Exact Test demonstrated a p < 0.0001, with a corresponding Odds Ratio of 1.20 with a 95% confidence interval (1.12;1.29). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated SIP order were associated with a statistically and clinically significant increase in the proportion of opioid overdoses in relation to the overall change in total ED visits.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.12.047,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.12.047,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.12.047,2021-03-01,,,
339,Reimagining patient-centered care in opioid treatment programs: Lessons from the Bronx during COVID-19,"Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) operate within a rigid set of clinical guidelines and regulations that specify the number of required OTP visits for supervised administration of methadone. To ensure physical distancing in light of COVID-19, the federal government loosened regulations to allow for additional flexibility. As OTP providers in the Bronx, NY, caring for more than 3600 patients in the epicenter of both the overdose and COVID-19 pandemics, we describe how our clinical practice changed with COVID-19. We halted toxicology testing, and to promote physical distancing and prevent interruptions in access to treatment for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), we drastically increased unsupervised take-home doses of MOUD. Within two weeks, we reduced the proportion of patients with 5–6 OTP visits per week from 47.2% to 9.4%. To guide treatment decision-making, we shifted focus from toxicology tests to other patient-centered measures, such as engagement in care and patient goals. In the initial three months, our patients experienced six nonfatal overdoses, no fatal overdoses, and 20 deaths attributable to COVID-19. This experience provides an opportunity to re-imagine care in OTPs going forward. We advocate that OTPs rely less on toxicology testing and more on the other patient-centered measures to guide decisions about distribution of take-home doses of MOUD. To minimize financial risk to OTPs and facilitate their transition to a more flexible model of care, we advocate for the reassessment of OTP reimbursement models.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108219,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108219,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108219,2021-03-01,,,

This commentary describes how four rural and/or Appalachian communities quickly pivoted their existing THN programs to respond to community need. These pivots, which reflect both the context of each community and the capacities of its service delivery and technology platforms, resulted in enhancements to THN training and distribution that have maintained or expanded the reach of their efforts.

352,"Quality of life in the COVID-19 outbreak: influence of psychological distress, government strategies, social distancing, and emotional recovery","Considering the severity of the effects of COVID-19 on psychological health and quality of life, the present study investigates the direct effects of government strategies and social distancing and the moderating effect of emotional recovery on psychological distress and quality of life using the tenets of the theory of attachment and learned helplessness. The snowball sampling technique was used to recruit respondents from Bangladesh who completed a self-administered questionnaire via Google Forms, which provided cross-sectional data. The results revealed that both social distancing and government strategies have significant negative influences on psychological distress. Besides, government strategies have a significant positive influence on social distancing. Although psychological distress has a significant negative influence on quality of life, emotional recovery shows no moderating effect on the relationship between psychological distress and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic.

354,Characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 inpatients who underwent psychiatric consultations,"Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are at risk of developing many neuropsychiatric disorders, due to the effects of the disease on the brain and the psychosocial pressures of having the disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19, who underwent psychiatric consultations. The medical records of 892 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and the 89 among them who requested psychiatric consultations were analyzed retrospectively. After the psychiatric consultations, patients were most frequently diagnosed with delirium (38.2 %), adjustment disorder (27.0 %), depressive disorder (19.1 %) and anxiety disorder (11.2 %). Patients with delirium had longer hospital stays (p < 0.001), were transferred more frequently to intensive care units (p < 0.001), and had higher mortality rates during their hospital stays (p < 0.001), than all other patients. The need for oxygen (p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) was also significantly higher in delirium patients, as well as in patients who received other psychiatric diagnoses. Neuropsychiatric disorders develop in patients receiving inpatient treatments in COVID-19 wards, and these disorders negatively affect the prognosis of COVID-19.

361,An Emotion Care Model using Multimodal Textual Analysis on COVID-19,"At the dawn of the year 2020, the world was hit by a significant pandemic COVID-19, that traumatized the entire planet. The infectious spread grew in leaps and bounds and forced the policymakers and governments to move towards lockdown. The lockdown further compelled people to stay under house arrest, which further resulted in an outbreak of emotions on social media platforms. Perceiving people's emotional state during these times becomes critically and strategically important for the government and the policymakers. In this regard, a novel emotion care scheme has been proposed in this paper to analyze multimodal textual data contained in real-time tweets related to COVID-19. Moreover, this paper studies 8-scale emotions (Anger, Anticipation, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, and Trust) over multiple categories such as nature, lockdown, health, education, market, and politics. This is the first of its kind linguistic analysis on multiple modes pertaining to the pandemic to the best of our understanding. Taking India as a case study, we inferred from this textual analysis that ‘joy’ has been lesser towards everything (~9-15%) but nature (~17%) due to the apparent fact of lessened pollution. The education system entailed more trust (~29%) due to teachers' fraternity's consistent efforts. The health sector witnessed sadness (~16%) and fear (~18%) as the dominant emotions among the masses as human lives were at stake. Additionally, the state-wise and emotion-wise depiction is also provided.

This study explored the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Bangladeshi students’ mental health and detected potential influencing factors related to post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and depressive symptoms. Convenience sampling was applied to collect data via online survey from 3997 college and university students between 29th May and 22nd July 2020. PHQ-9 and IES scales were used to assess depressive symptoms and PTSS, respectively. Of all participants, 52.87% had depressive symptoms and 40.91% had PTSS. Severe educational disruption was a risk factor for depressive symptoms (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.37–2.06) and PTSS (AOR = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.51–2.29). COVID-19 like symptoms including fever, cough, breathing difficulty and fatigue showed a stronger association with higher IES and PHQ-9 scores than other symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, sore throat) (p ≤ 0.01). Fear of infection and death by COVID-19 were risk factors for PTSS and depressive symptoms (p ≤ 0.01). Recreational activity and regular physical exercise emerged as the most protective factors for depressive symptoms and PTSS.

368,Characterizing pediatric emergency department visits during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective We determine how pediatric emergency department (ED) visits changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of U.S. EDs. Methods Using retrospective data from January–June 2020, compared to a similar 2019 period, we calculated weekly 2020–2019 ratios of Non-COVID-19 ED visits for adults and children (age 18 years or less) by age range. Outcomes were pediatric ED visit rates before and after the onset of pandemic, by age, disposition, and diagnosis. Results We included data from 2,213,828 visits to 144 EDs and 4 urgent care centers in 18 U.S. states, including 7 EDs in children's hospitals. During the pandemic period, adult non-COVID-19 visits declined to 60% of 2019 volumes and then partially recovered but remained below 2019 levels through June 2020. Pediatric visits declined even more sharply, with peak declines through the week of April 15 of 74% for children age < 10 years and 67% for 14–17 year. Visits recovered by June to 72% for children age 14–17, but to only 50% of 2019 levels for children < age 10 years. Declines were seen across all ED types and locations, and across all diagnoses, with an especially sharp decline in non-COVID-19 communicable diseases. During the pandemic period, there was 22% decline in common serious pediatric conditions, including appendicitis. Conclusion Pediatric ED visits fell more sharply than adult ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and remained depressed through June 2020, especially for younger children. Declines were also seen for serious conditions, suggesting that parents may have avoided necessary care for their children.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.11.037,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.11.037,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.11.037,2021-03-01,,,

371,Parenting activities and the transition to home-based education during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study reports on parent-child dynamics during initial COVID-19 related school closures, based on cross-sectional analyses of a survey that utilized a convenience sampling approach. Data were collected in April 2020, approximately five weeks after the World Health Organization declared that the Coronavirus was a pandemic. Participants (N = 405) were adults recruited throughout the U.S. This study examines data from parents (69% mothers and 31% fathers) with at least one child 0–12 years of age. The majority were White (71%) and 41% had at least a bachelor’s degree. The majority of parents (78%) were educating their child at home due to COVID-19. Most (77.1%) reported use of online tools for at-home education, including educational apps, social media, and school-provided electronic resources. More than one-third (34.7%) of parents said their child’s behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B = −0.16, 95% CI = [−0.29, −0.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B = −0.37, 95% CI = [−0.47, −0.27], p < .001) were negatively associated with parents’ perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = 0.17, 95% CI = [0.06, 0.28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = 0.40, 95% CI = [0.32, 0.48], p < .001). Content analyses of open-ended questions indicated that school closures were a significant disruption, followed by lack of physical activity, and social isolation.

375,Do psychological strengths protect college students confined by COVID-19 to emotional distress? The role of gender,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a stressful situation for the university population due to the important changes in the development of their studies and in their living conditions. However, the impact of factors related to the family unit (living with COVID-19 positive patients and living with Essential Services Workers-ESW) and other protective psychosocial factors that could produce resilient or psychopathological results (anxiety and depression) in this population has not been sufficiently assessed, differentiating them by gender. The results obtained show that both variables related to the family unit and psychosocial protective variables explain 28.6% of the variance in general distress in the total sample (R2 = 0.286; F(3,250) =34,717; p < .001). However, models of regression of distress and anxiety levels differ between men and women, but not in terms of mood alteration. Women facing circumstances reminiscent of mandatory pandemic containment have moderately higher levels of resilience than men (tCDRISC(125) = 2.218; p < .05; tGSE(125) = 2.415; p < .05; tCDRISC(125) = 0.146; p = .884; tGSE(125) = 0.315; p = .756).

376,Immediate psychological responses during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi medical students,"Background The most recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has been creating multidimensional damages, including a detrimental impact on the mental health status of individuals. Medical students, a vulnerable cross-section of the population, may have perceived a myriad of psychological stressors during this crisis in the background of their prevailing stressful academic pressure and preexisting higher psychological and mental health issue. Objective To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to elucidate the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Bangladeshi medical students. Method A cross-sectional study design was utilized to conduct this survey. The online survey including demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; higher scores on the subscales indicate higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms), was completed by 425 Bangladeshi medical students. Collected data were statistically analyzed by using SPSS (version 25.0) software. Result The HADS anxiety subscale revealed that 65.9% of the medical students had different levels of anxiety, ranging from mild (27.3%), moderate (26.8%), and severe (11.8%). As per HADS depression subscale, 49.9% of the medical students had varying degrees of depressive symptoms, with 3.3% of the participants had suffered from severe depressive symptoms. Female students had a relatively more anxiety and depressive symptoms when compared with males. The students, who were severely tensed of getting infected by the virus, were at higher risk of suffering from anxiety (3.5-fold) and depressive (2.7-fold) symptoms, when compared with no/minimally stressed students. Besides, fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to hospital or home, not to be able to give maximum concentration on study after COVID-19 pandemic, students’ present emotional status (agitation), had statistically significant higher risk of anxiety. Conclusion A substantial proportion of Bangladeshi medical students are experiencing pandemic-related adverse psychological impact. Poor mental health conditions of these vulnerable medical students pose important threat to their potential contribution in future health care. Thus, medical colleges and health authorities should focus on addressing their psychological needs and formulate effective strategies to ameliorate medical students’ mental health status, particularly during any infectious disease outbreak.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105912,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105912,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105912,2021-03-01,,,
377,The role of online social comparison as a protective factor for psychological wellbeing: A longitudinal study during the COVID-19 quarantine,"During the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the experience of quarantine has been an undesirable condition for people and it can have a negative impact on mental health and psychological wellbeing. Social isolation has led to an increase in time spent on social network sites, with people interacting more frequently with each other, and comparing online the way in which they are experiencing the same state of home confinement. Our study aimed to investigate the role of online social comparison on individuals' psychological distress and life satisfaction during the COVID-19-related quarantine. Specifically, a cross-lagged panel study at three-waves was conducted in Italy in order to examine the change in psychosocial distress levels (e.g. depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, low life-satisfaction) from before the quarantine for a period of one month, as well as the predictive role of online social comparison to ameliorate individual distress. An online survey was distributed through a social media platform three times after the initial lockdown and at the epidemic's peak two and five weeks later. A total of 113 participants participated in an online survey between the 7th of March and 14th of April 2020. The results showed an increase in the levels of loneliness, depression, stress, anxiety and a decrease in the level of life satisfaction in the pre/post quarantine comparison. Our cross-lagged results also showed that online social comparison at T1 and T2 predicted the individual's improvement in levels of anxiety, stress, loneliness and life satisfaction over time. Overall, the results of the current study underline the positive effects of online social comparison on the reduction of psychological distress during the COVID-19 quarantine.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110486,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110486,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2020.110486,2021-03-01,,,

379,Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with allergic diseases,"Background On March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic disease. Interactions between allergy-related inflammatory and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been documented. Therefore, those who have pre-existing allergic conditions may have an increased psychiatric reaction to the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective Identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 in patients with allergic diseases and determine if these individuals have a greater risk of presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods It is a cross-sectional, survey-based study designed to assess the degree of symptoms of depression and the risk of PTSD using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), respectively, in allergic patients. Results A total of 4106 surveys were evaluated; 1656 (40.3%) were patients with allergic disease, and 2450 (59.7%) were non-allergic (control) individuals. Of those with allergies, 76.6% had respiratory allergic disease including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Individuals with allergic disease reported higher scores regarding symptoms of PTSD on the IES-R scale (p = 0.052, OR 1.24 CI 0.99–1.55) as well as a higher depression risk score in the PHQ-9 questionnaire (mean 6.82 vs. 5.28) p = 0.000 z = −8.76. The allergy group presented a higher score in the IES-R questionnaire (mean 25.42 vs. 20.59), being more susceptible to presenting PTSD (p = 0.000, z = −7.774). The individuals with allergic conditions were further divided into subgroups of those with respiratory allergies such as allergic rhinitis and asthma vs those with non-respiratory allergies such as drug and food allergy, urticaria and atopic dermatitis. This subgroup analysis compares respiratory versus non-respiratory allergic patients, with similar results on the IES-R (mean 25.87 vs 23.9) p = 0.0124, z = −1.539. There was no significant difference on intrusion (p = 0.061, z = −1.873) and avoidance (p = 0.767, z = −0.297), but in the hyperarousal subscale, patients with respiratory allergy had higher scores (mean 1.15 vs. 0.99) p = 0.013 z = −2.486. Conclusions Psychological consequences such as depression and reported PTSD are present during the COVID-19 pandemic causing an impact particularly in individuals with allergic diseases.

386,Mental well-being and association of the four factors coping structure model: A perspective of people living in lockdown during COVID-19,"Background The physical and mental health risks of COVID-19 become higher as people are asked to stay home for an indefinite period. The objective was to investigate the link between the four-factor structure model of coping and mental health among those living in lockdown. Methods The sample was comprised of 100 participants. The data was collected through purposive sampling. Mental health was measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and coping strategies from the Brief Cope Inventory. A personal information questionnaire was also used to gather information about the characteristics of participants, such as age, gender and education, in addition to questions related to other stressors. Linear regression was used to assess the association between variables. A P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Overall, the results showed high levels of stress, anxiety and depression among participants. These findings revealed a significant association between active avoidance and religious/denial coping strategies and mental health problems. However, problem-focused and positive coping strategies were found to be insignificant for all three mental health problems. Other social and personal factors, such as being away from family (90%), having problems sleeping (86%), worrying about the future (85%), experiencing anger (83%), lacking emotional support (79%) and having fear of receiving bad news (72%), were reported often by participants. Conclusion Participants showed concern for COVID-19 that was associated with anxiety, stress and depression.

390,Ancillary services in Great Britain during the COVID-19 lockdown: A glimpse of the carbon-free future,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to partial or total lockdowns in several countries during the first half of 2020, which in turn caused a depressed electricity demand. In Great Britain (GB), this low demand combined with large renewable output at times, created conditions that were not expected until renewable capacity increases to meet emissions targets in coming years. The GB system experienced periods of very high instantaneous penetration of non-synchronous renewables, compromising system stability due to the lack of inertia in the grid. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the consequences of the lockdown on the GB electricity system is provided, focusing on the ancillary services procured to guarantee stability. Ancillary-services costs increased by £200m in the months of May to July 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 (a threefold increase), highlighting the importance of ancillary services in low-carbon systems. Furthermore, a frequency-secured scheduling model is used in the present paper to showcase the future trends that GB is expected to experience, as penetration of renewables increases on the road to net-zero emissions by 2050. Several sensitivities are considered, demonstrating that the share of total operating costs represented by ancillary services could reach 35%.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116500,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116500,Scopus,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116500,2021-03-01,,,

Many of these patients admitted to making home brews of alcohol while others simply use industrial toxic alcohols. The diagnosis of these poisonings is challenging as direct assays are not available in our setting. Case report We present a case of presumed ethylene glycol poisoning that presented with persistent seizures and a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). Discussion A high index of suspicion for toxic alcohol poisoning should be maintained in patients presenting with an altered mental status, seizures and a HAGMA. Indirect markers such as clinical features and laboratory results can lead to the diagnosis when direct assays are unavailable.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.afjem.2020.10.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.afjem.2020.10.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.afjem.2020.10.011,2021-03-01,,,
392,Macroeconomic policies and the pandemic-driven recession,"We build a three-country DSGE model to address the economic fallout from the COVID-19 shock. First, three different scenarios –optimistic, baseline and pessimistic– are drawn where economic authorities are assumed to not react to the disturbance. We find that the pandemic brings about a prolonged economic depression in the latter scenario –the most realistic one–, as GDP and hours worked fall by 20% (from trend) and they never recover their pre-crisis levels over the span of time studied. We then move on to analyze the effectiveness of conventional fiscal and monetary policy tools in curbing the recessionary consequences of the pandemic. The most powerful instruments are government purchases and expansionary monetary policy, although these two measures come with some trade-offs. In addition, we explore how a binding zero lower bound (ZLB) that renders conventional monetary policy ineffective can affect our findings. We show that the lower constraint deepens the recession caused by the pandemic, primarily because the central bank cannot lower the policy rate further, and because fiscal policy tightens in order to ensure government debt sustainability. Naturally, we next ask ourselves what would happen in this context did the monetary authority rely on unconventional monetary policy to try to dampen the recessionary consequences of the pandemic. Our results reveal that quantitative easing (QE) prevents private consumption, inflation, and to a much lesser extent, output from falling as much due to the shock.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.iref.2020.12.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.iref.2020.12.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.iref.2020.12.010,2021-03-01,,,

400,Confinement variables by COVID-19 predictors of anxious and depressive symptoms in pregnant women,"Antecedentes y objetivos La aparición de una enfermedad altamente contagiosa obligó a confinar a la población en casi todo el mundo, ocasionando el aumento de problemática psicológica, siendo las mujeres embarazadas un grupo especialmente vulnerable a sufrir consecuencias negativas. El objetivo de esta investigación fue comprobar qué variables de confinamiento o estrés psicológico están relacionadas con el aumento de la sintomatología ansiosa y depresiva en mujeres embarazadas, como consecuencia de la pandemia ocasionada por la COVID-19. Materiales y métodos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 131 mujeres embarazadas que vivieron el confinamiento impuesto por el Gobierno de España el 14 de marzo de 2020. Se recogieron variables sociodemográficas, obstétricas, relacionadas con el confinamiento y variables psicológicas. Resultados El estrés percibido, estrés específico del embarazo, así como el insomnio son variables predictoras en la mayoría de síntomas ansiosos (obsesiones y compulsiones, ansiedad y ansiedad fóbica) y depresivos relacionados con la COVID-19. Conclusiones Es importante destinar futuras intervenciones psicológicas en esta población al control del estrés y monitorización del sueño, ya que estas variables influyen en el incremento de ansiedad y depresión. Background and objectives The appearance of a highly contagious disease forced the confinement of the population in almost all parts of the world, causing an increase in psychological problems, with pregnant women being a particularly vulnerable group to suffer negative consequences. The aim of this research was to check which confinement or psychological stress variables are related to the increase of anxious and depressive symptoms in pregnant women, as a consequence of the pandemic caused by the COVID-19. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 131 pregnant women who experienced the confinement imposed by the Government of Spain on March 14, 2020. Sociodemographic, obstetric, confinement related and psychological variables were collected. Results Perceived stress, pregnancy-specific stress, as well as insomnia are predictive variables in most anxious (obsessions and compulsions, anxiety and phobic anxiety) and depressive symptoms related to COVID-19. Conclusions It is important to focus future psychological interventions in this population on stress control and sleep monitoring, since these variables influence the increase of anxiety and depression.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.10.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.10.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.medcli.2020.10.002,2021-02-26,,,

403,Antidepressant drugs as emerging contaminants: Occurrence in urban and non-urban waters and analytical methods for their detection,"Antidepressants are drugs with a direct action on the brain's biochemistry through their interaction with the neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The increasing worldwide contamination from these drugs may be witnessed through their increasing presence in the urban water cycle. Furthermore, their occurrence has been detected in non-urban water, such as rivers and oceans. Some endemic aquatic animals, such as certain fish and mollusks, have bioaccumulated different antidepressant drugs in their tissues. This problem will increase in the years to come because the present COVID-19 pandemic has increased the general worldwide occurrence of depression and anxiety, triggering the consumption of antidepressants and, consequently, their presence in the environment. This work provides information on the occurrence of the most administrated antidepressants in urban waters, wastewater treatment plants, rivers, and oceans. Furthermore, it provides an overview of the analytical approaches currently used to detect each antidepressant presented. Finally, the ecotoxicological effect of antidepressants on several in vivo models are listed. Considering the information provided in this review, there is an urgent need to test the presence of antidepressant members of the MAOI and TCA groups. Furthermore, incorporating new degradation/immobilization technologies in WWTPs will be useful to stop the increasing occurrence of these drugs in the environment.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143722,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143722,Scopus,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143722,2021-02-25,,,

Cognitive biases have been related to depression degree in previous studies. Here, we used behavioral and brain imaging analysis, to determine if and how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the relationship between current cognitive biases and future depression degree and the underlying neural basis in a nonclinical depressed population. An out-expectation result showed that a more negative memory bias was associated with a greater decrease in future depressive indices in nonclinical depressed participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might be due to decreased social stress. These data enhance our understanding of how the depressive degree of nonclinical depressed populations will change during the COVID-19 pandemic and also provide support for social distancing policies from a psychological perspective.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102081,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102081,Scopus,10.1016/j.isci.2021.102081,2021-02-19,,,

442,Associations between insecurity and stress among Chinese university students: The mediating effects of hope and self-efficacy,"Background In the context of the pandemic, exploration on the association between insecurity and stress among university students is limited. The current study aims to investigate the parallel mediation role of hope and self-efficacy in the relationship between insecurity and stress among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We employed a cross-sectional research design in a university by distributing questionnaires online. 5286 participants were recruited (mean age = 19.65; SD = 1.13). Items were from the Security Questionnaire, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, and the Positive Psychology Capital (Psycap) Questionnaire (PPQ). Parallel mediation analysis was performed using PROCESS macro in SPSS. Results The results indicate that insecurity predicted students’ stress positively and that students with high-level perceived insecurity are more likely to perceive stress. Moreover, hope and self-efficacy mediated the relationship between insecurity and stress, indicating that hope and self-efficacy could buffer the negative effects of insecurity on stress. Limitations This study examines the mediating model between insecurity and stress among Chinese university students. The generalizability of the findings in other regions remains to be explored. Additionally, the roles of other positive self-beliefs including optimism and resilience in relieving stress can be further explored in future research. Conclusions This research provides direct evidence of insecurity effects on stress among university students, enriching relevant theories in the field of stress. Moreover, this research suggests that enhancing positive self-beliefs such as hope, and self-efficacy helps to relieve students’ stress during COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.047,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.047,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.047,2021-02-15,,,
443,Sleep Conditions Associate with Anxiety and Depression Symptoms among Pregnant Women during the Epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen,"Background Pregnant women often encounter psychiatric symptoms and declined sleep quality as pregnancy proceeds. The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. Methods An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. Results In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality. Limitations Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women.

444,Prevalence of psychological disorders in the COVID-19 epidemic in China: A real world cross-sectional study,"Objective This study aimed to explore the prevalence of psychological disorders and associated factors at different stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods The mental health status of respondents was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. Results 5657 individuals participated in this study. History of chronic disease was a common risk factor for severe present depression (OR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82–2.66, p < 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.41, 95% CI, 1.97–2.95, p < 0.001), and insomnia (OR 2.33, 95% CI, 1.83–2.95, p < 0.001) in the survey population. Female respondents had a higher risk of depression (OR 1.61, 95% CI, 1.39–1.87, p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.15–1.57, p < 0.001) than males. Among the medical workers, confirmed or suspected positive COVID-19 infection as associated with higher scores for depression (confirmed, OR 1.87; suspected, OR 4.13), anxiety (confirmed, OR 3.05; suspected, OR 3.07), and insomnia (confirmed, OR 3.46; suspected, OR 4.71). Limitation The cross-sectional design of present study presents inference about causality. The present psychological assessment was based on an online survey and on self-report tools, albeit using established instruments. We cannot estimate the participation rate, since we cannot know how many potential subjects received and opened the link for the survey. Conclusions Females, non-medical workers and those with a history of chronic diseases have had higher risks for depression, insomnia, and anxiety.

446,Prevalence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background The global COVID-19 pandemic has generated major mental and psychological health problems worldwide. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We searched online biomedical databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, CNKI, and Wanfang Data) and preprint databases (SSRN, bioRxiv, and MedRxiv) for observational studies from January 1, 2020 to March 16, 2020 investigating the prevalence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results We retrieved 821 citations from the biomedical databases and 53 citations from the preprint databases: 66 studies with 221,970 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia was 31.4%, 31.9%, 41.1% and 37.9%, respectively. Noninfectious chronic disease patients, quarantined persons, and COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of depression (Q=26.73, p<0.01) and anxiety (Q=21.86, p<0.01) than other populations. The general population and non-medical staff had a lower risk of distress than other populations (Q=461.21, p< 0.01). Physicians, nurses, and non-medical staff showed a higher prevalence of insomnia (Q=196.64, p<0.01) than other populations. Limitations All included studies were from the early phase of the global pandemic. Additional meta-analyses are needed to obtain more data in all phases of the pandemic. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic increases the mental health problems of the global population, particularly health care workers, noninfectious chronic disease patients, COVID-19 patients, and quarantined persons. Interventions for mental health are urgently needed for preventing mental health problems.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.117,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.117,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.117,2021-02-15,,,

448,"Coping strategies, cyberbullying behaviors, and depression among Chinese netizens during the COVID-19 pandemic: a web-based nationwide survey","Background: As a major life stressor now, the COVID-19 pandemic could substantially increase risks of cyberbullying and depression for global people, especially in the context of increased digital interconnectedness and strict social distancing. Though people are adopting different coping strategies, still little is known about their cyberbullying and depression and how the two associated with coping strategies. Methods: A web-based nationwide questionnaire survey was conducted among 5,608 netizens during the peak time of COVID-19 in China. The study collected cross-sectional data on participants’ coping strategies, general cyberbullying behaviors, cyberbullying behaviors specifically to residents of Hubei Province where first COVID-19 case was reported, and depression. Results: A two-factor structure applied to participants’ coping strategies, namely problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping, and the former was more adopted. There existed gender, age, education, and income differences in the coping strategies. Problem-focused coping was associated with less cyberbullying behaviors while had no correlation with depression; emotion-focused coping was found positively correlated with cyberbullying and depression. The association between emotion-focused coping and depression was mediated by cyberbullying. Limitations: The study used cross-sectional design, and its findings should be cautioned to be generalized to other countries, due to the differences in culture, stage of crisis, and government policies on COVID-19. Conclusions: Problem-focused coping was associated with less cyberbullying, and emotion-focused coping predicted cyberbullying and depression. Cyberbullying mediated the correlation between emotion-focused coping and depression. These findings provide new perspectives for interventions on people's coping strategies towards COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.023,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.023,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.023,2021-02-15,,,
449,"The impact of social distancing during COVID-19: A conditional process model of negative emotions, alienation, affective disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder","Background The social distancing during COVID-19 is likely to cause a feeling of alienation, which may pose a threat to the public's mental health. Our research aims to examine the relationship between negative emotions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), considering the mediation effect of alienation and how it is moderated by anxiety and depression. Methods For this, the current study conducted a cross-sectional survey on 7145 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19, via online questionnaires comprised of a self-designed Negative emotions questionnaire, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90), PTSD Checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), and Adolescent Students Alienation Scale (ASAS). Results A total of 6666 pieces of data from the general population were included in the statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics showed a relatively mild level of mental disorders. Besides, results of Conditional Process Model analysis supported our hypotheses that negative emotions and alienation were both predictors for PTSD symptoms, and their direct and indirect effects were all moderated by the level of anxiety. Limitations This study was limited by the generality and causality of the conclusion. The moderating effect of depression was left for further study due to the collinearity problem of variables. Conclusions Social distancing may have an impact on individuals’ mental health by the feeling of alienation, which was moderated by affective disorders. Clinical psychologists should identify individuals’ particular cognition and mental disorders to provide a more accurate and adequate intervention for them.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.004,2021-02-15,,,
450,Mental Health Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China: A 2-Wave Longitudinal Survey,"Background Growing evidence supports a clear association between COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. However, little is known about the longitudinal course of psychopathology in young adults at different stages of the pandemic. Methods This large-scale, longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted among college students in China. The rates of three mental health problems (acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and their change patterns at two phases of the pandemic (early vs under-control) were measured. Predictors of changes in mental health symptoms were examined utilizing multivariate regression. Results Among the 164,101 college students who participated in the first wave survey (T1=during onset of outbreak), 68,685 (41.9%) completed a follow-up survey (T2=during remission). In the follow-up survey, the prevalence of probable acute stress (T1: 34.6%; T2: 16.4%) decreased, while the rates of depressive (T1: 21.6%; T2: 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (T1: 11.4%; T2: 14.7%) increased. Senior students, with suspected or conformed cases in their community and COVID-19 related worries (all AORs > 1.20, ps < 0.001) were found to have a higher risk of developing mental health problems in at least one wave. Less physical exercise, low perceived social support, and a dysfunctional family were found to negatively impact psychological symptoms. Conclusions Acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have been prevalent among college students during the COVID-19 epidemic, and showed a significant increase after the initial stage of the outbreak. Some college students, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibited persistent or delayed symptoms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.109,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.109,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.109,2021-02-15,,,

452,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Spain: comparison between community controls and patients with a psychiatric disorder. Preliminary results from the BRIS-MHC STUDY.,"Background : The aim of this study was to evaluate potential differences about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown between community controls (CC) and patients with a mental illness (MI) in a Spanish population during the state of emergency. Methods : Individuals with a psychiatric condition and the general population were invited to complete an anonymous online survey. Bivariate analyses were used to compare them in a broad range of measures: sociodemographic, clinical variables, behavioral changes related to the lockdown and coping strategies to face it. Two groups of different psychiatric disorders were compared: depression or anxiety disorders (D+A) versus bipolar disorder and schizophrenia related disorders (BD+SCZ). Results : 413 CC and 206 MI were included in the study. CC reported to use more adaptive coping strategies as following a routine, talking to friends/relatives, practicing physical exercise and maintaining a balanced diet. MI reported significantly more anxiety and depression symptoms during the lockdown when compared to CC. Gaining weight, sleep changes, and tobacco consumption were more prevalent in the MI group. The D+A group showed significantly more psychological distress and negative expectations about the future, suffered more sleep disturbances when compared to BD+SCZ, whilst reported to practice more exercise. Limitations : psychiatric disorders were self-reported. Conclusions : Imposed restrictions and uncertainty during confinement had a higher psychological impact in individuals with a psychiatric illness, with less healthy behavior strategies to face the situation. Developing interventions to mitigate negative mental health outcomes among this vulnerable population will be essential in the coming months.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.099,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.099,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.099,2021-02-15,,,

511,"Penetrating trauma during a global pandemic: Changing patterns in interpersonal violence, self-harm and domestic violence in the Covid-19 outbreak","Introduction The restrictions imposed on social activity in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound impact globally. In the UK, the NHS was placed on a war-footing, with elective surgery, face-to-face outpatient clinics, and community care facilities all scaled back as a temporary measure to redistribute scarce resources. There has been concern during this period over increasing levels of violence in the domestic setting, as well as self-harm. Methods Data was collected on all patients presenting with traumatic penetrating injuries during the ‘lockdown’ period of 23rd March to 29th April 2020. Demographics and injury details were compared with the same period in the two preceding years. Results Overall trauma fell by 35% compared with the previous year. Over one in four penetrating injuries seen were a result of self-harm, which was significantly higher than in previous years (11% in 2019, 2% in 2018). There were two cases of injuries due to domestic violence, while a total of 4 cases of injury arose in separate violent domestic incidents. Self-harm commonly involved penetrating injury to the neck. Discussion Our centre has seen an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries as a result of both self-harm and violence in the domestic setting. The number of penetrating neck injury cases, which can represent suicidal intent or a major presentation of psychiatric illness, is of particular concern. We must further investigate the effect of social restrictions on violent injury, and how home confinement may influence a changing demographic picture of victims.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004,2021-02-01,,,
512,Suicidal and self-harm ideation among Chinese hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence and correlates,"The COVID-19 pandemic put global medical systems under massive pressure for its uncertainty, severity, and persistence. For detecting the prevalence of suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI) and its related risk factors among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional study collected the sociodemographic data, epidemic-related information, the psychological status and need, and perceived stress and support from 11507 staff in 46 hospitals by an online survey from February 14 to March 2, 2020. The prevalence of SSI was 6.47%. Hospital staff with SSI had high family members or relatives infected number and the self-rated probability of infection. Additionally, they had more perceived stress, psychological need, and psychological impact. On the contrary, hospital staff without SSI reported high self-rated health, willingness to work in a COVID-19 ward, confidence in defeating COVID-19, and perceived support. Furthermore, they reported better marital or family relationship, longer sleep hours, and shorter work hours. The infection of family members or relatives, poor marital status, poor self-rated health, the current need for psychological intervention, perceived high stress, perceived low support, depression, and anxiety were independent factors to SSI. A systematic psychological intervention strategy during a public health crisis was needed for the hospital staff's mental well-being.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113654,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113654,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113654,2021-02-01,,,
513,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care-recorded mental illness and self-harm episodes in the UK: a population-based cohort study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected population mental health. We aimed to assess temporal trends in primary care-recorded common mental illness, episodes of self-harm, psychotropic medication prescribing, and general practitioner (GP) referrals to mental health services during the COVID-19 emergency in the UK. Methods We did a population-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from general practices registered on the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We included patient records from Jan 1, 2010, to Sept 10, 2020, to establish long-term trends and patterns of seasonality, but focused primarily on the period January, 2019–September, 2020. We extracted data on clinical codes entered into patient records to estimate the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders, self-harm, prescriptions for antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and GP referrals to mental health services, and assessed event rates of all psychotropic prescriptions and self-harm. We used mean-dispersion negative binomial regression models to predict expected monthly incidence and overall event rates, which were then compared with observed rates to assess the percentage reduction in incidence and event rates after March, 2020. We also stratified analyses by sex, age group, and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. Findings We identified 14 210 507 patients from 1697 UK general practices registered in the CPRD databases. In April, 2020, compared with expected rates, the incidence of primary care-recorded depression had reduced by 43·0% (95% CI 38·3–47·4), anxiety disorders by 47·8% (44·3–51·2), and first antidepressant prescribing by 36·4% (33·9–38·8) in English general practices. Reductions in first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders were largest for adults of working age (18–44 and 45–64 years) and for patients registered at practices in more deprived areas. The incidence of self-harm was 37·6% (34·8–40·3%) lower than expected in April, 2020, and the reduction was greatest for women and individuals aged younger than 45 years. By September, 2020, rates of incident depression, anxiety disorder, and self-harm were similar to expected levels. In Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, rates of incident depression and anxiety disorder remained around a third lower than expected to September, 2020. In April, 2020, the rate of referral to mental health services was less than a quarter of the expected rate for the time of year (75·3% reduction [74·0–76·4]). Interpretation Consequences of the considerable reductions in primary care-recorded mental illness and self-harm could include more patients subsequently presenting with greater severity of mental illness and increasing incidence of non-fatal self-harm and suicide. Addressing the effects of future lockdowns and longer-term impacts of economic instability on mental health should be prioritised.

521,Preliminary investigation of the association between COVID-19 and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the U.S.,"Evidence suggests that the negative consequences of COVID-19 may extend far beyond its considerable death toll, having a significant impact on psychological well-being. Despite work highlighting the link between previous epidemics and elevated suicide rates, there is limited research on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Utilizing an online survey, the current study aimed to better understand the presence, and extent, of the association between COVID-19-related experiences and past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adults in the United States recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 907). Results support an association between several COVID-19-related experiences (i.e., general distress, fear of physical harm, effects of social distancing policies) and past-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Further, a significant proportion of those with recent suicidal ideation explicitly link their suicidal thoughts to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses highlight a potential additional link between COVID-19 and suicidal behavior, suggesting that a portion of individuals may be intentionally exposing themselves to the virus with intent to kill themselves. These findings underscore the need for suicide risk screening and access to mental health services during the current pandemic. Particular attention should be paid to employing public health campaigns to disseminate information on such services to reduce the enormity of distress and emotional impairment associated with COVID-19 in the United States.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.037,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.037,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.037,2021-02-01,,,

525,Suicidal behaviors and suicide risk among Bangladeshi people during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online cross-sectional survey,"Background Suicide, a major public health concern, is a leading cause of injury and death worldwide. The present study aims to assess suicidal behaviors and suicide risk among Bangladeshi people during COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from July 10 to July 20, 2020, involving 1,415 Bangladeshi residents ages 18 years or older. Data was collected via an anonymous online questionnaire. The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised was used to assess suicide risk. The depression and anxiety subscales of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analyses and Pearson's correlation were performed to examine the association of variables. Results The prevalence of suicide ideation and planning among Bangladeshi people during the COVID-19 pandemic was 19.0% and 18.5%, respectively. Having suicidal risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by 33.5% participants. Suicide risk was associated higher with females, divorced or widowed marital statuses and low educational attainment (i.e., secondary or below and higher secondary/diploma). Additionally, living in high COVID-19 prevalent areas, having economic loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, relatives or acquaintances die from COVID-19, direct contact with COVID-19 patient(s), and fear of COVID-19 infection were associated with suicide risk. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic imposes significant psychological consequences on people, thus, concerned authorities should pay attention to people's mental health and focus on suicide prevention and awareness during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e05937,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e05937,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e05937,2021-02-01,,,

546,Coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with inborn errors of immunity: An international study,"Background There is uncertainty about the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in individuals with rare inborn errors of immunity (IEI), a population at risk of developing severe coronavirus disease 2019. This is relevant not only for these patients but also for the general population, because studies of IEIs can unveil key requirements for host defense. Objective We sought to describe the presentation, manifestations, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IEI to inform physicians and enhance understanding of host defense against SARS-CoV-2. Methods An invitation to participate in a retrospective study was distributed globally to scientific, medical, and patient societies involved in the care and advocacy for patients with IEI. Results We gathered information on 94 patients with IEI with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their median age was 25 to 34 years. Fifty-three patients (56%) suffered from primary antibody deficiency, 9 (9.6%) had immune dysregulation syndrome, 6 (6.4%) a phagocyte defect, 7 (7.4%) an autoinflammatory disorder, 14 (15%) a combined immunodeficiency, 3 (3%) an innate immune defect, and 2 (2%) bone marrow failure. Ten were asymptomatic, 25 were treated as outpatients, 28 required admission without intensive care or ventilation, 13 required noninvasive ventilation or oxygen administration, 18 were admitted to intensive care units, 12 required invasive ventilation, and 3 required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine patients (7 adults and 2 children) died. Conclusions This study demonstrates that (1) more than 30% of patients with IEI had mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and (2) risk factors predisposing to severe disease/mortality in the general population also seemed to affect patients with IEI, including more younger patients. Further studies will identify pathways that are associated with increased risk of severe disease and are nonredundant or redundant for protection against SARS-CoV-2.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.09.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.09.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.jaci.2020.09.010,2021-02-01,,,

548,Suicide during COVID-19 and other major international respiratory outbreaks: A systematic review,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recently declared a pandemic by the WHO. This outbreak threatens not only physical health but also has significant repercussions on mental health. In recent world history, major infectious outbreaks were associated with severe mental health sequelae, including suicide. In this study, we systematically review the literature on suicidal outcomes during major international respiratory outbreaks, including COVID-19. We reviewed descriptive and analytic articles addressing suicide during major international respiratory outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases and then utilized an independent method for study selection by a pair of reviewers. Two reviewers completed data abstraction and conducted a narrative summary of the findings. Our search generated 2,153 articles. Nine studies (three descriptive, five analytical, and one with mixed methodology) were eligible. The included studies were heterogeneous, divergent in methods, and with a low degree of evidence. Deducing an association between pandemics, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes remains thus poorly supported. Future research with better methodological characteristics, the use of longitudinal studies, and a focus on suicide as the primary outcome would allow for an in-depth understanding and formulation of the scope of this problem.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102509,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102509,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102509,2021-02-01,,,

554,Correlates of psychological distress in epileptic patients during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Introduction Following the severe consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, on March 9th, 2020 the Italian Government implemented extraordinary measures to limit viral transmission, including restrictive quarantine measures. Psychological distress represents the seizure-precipitating factor most often reported by patients with epilepsy. To date, no studies have analyzed the role played by the different dimensions of psychological distress quarantine-induced in patients with epilepsy. Materials and Methods We included a total of 40 patients, 18 suffered from generalized, and 22 from focal epilepsy. The patients previously seen in the outpatient clinic during the pre-lockdown period between January and February 2020 were reevaluated after the lockdown period. Psychological distress was evaluated by using the three subscales of Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Finally, we employed logistic regression analyses to explore the demographic and clinical features associated to high scores on IES-R. Results Patients with higher scores on IES-R Intrusion and IES-R Avoidance subscales demonstrated an increased number of epileptic attacks compared to prelockdown period. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that a specific subgroup of patients (i.e., older, female with more anxious symptoms) are at higher risk of increased seizure frequency. Conclusions Our study confirmed that the frequency of epileptic seizures increased during lockdown when compared to pre-lockdown period. The early identification of patients more vulnerable to worsening is crucial to limit the risk of requiring hospital or clinical treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107632,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107632,Scopus,10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107632,2021-02-01,,,

557,Myocardial injury in a patient with severe coronavirus disease: A case report,"Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can lead to severe disease or death and is characterized by a wide range of mild to severe symptoms. In addition to the lungs, studies have reported the involvement of the stomach, intestine, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the heart. Case report We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who died soon after developing multi-organ failure and myocardial injury due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A 71-year-old man who contracted COVID-19 was admitted to the hospital after presenting with fever for 7 days and developed dyspnea. Following treatment, his respiratory status worsened. Thus, he was transferred to our hospital for intensive care on day 11. Physical examination revealed fever, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and no chest pain. Invasive positive pressure ventilation was initiated for acute respiratory distress syndrome on day 14. On day 15, we observed renal, liver, and coagulation dysfunction, indicating multi-organ failure. Chest radiography did not show clear signs of an increased cardiothoracic ratio or pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of myocardial infarction, which was confirmed by elevated troponin I and creatine kinase levels. The patient's circulatory dynamics did not improve on medication, and he died on day 16. Conclusions We report the case of a patient with severe COVID-19 who died from an exacerbation of myocardial injury. Clinicians should not only evaluate respiration but also assess the heart by performing a 12-lead ECG, echocardiogram, and myocardial injury marker examination. Together, these tools can help predict which patients will develop severe COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.09.023,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.09.023,Scopus,10.1016/j.jiac.2020.09.023,2021-02-01,,,
558,An Online Questionnaire Survey on the Sexual Life and Sexual Function of Chinese Adult Men During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic,"Introduction There has been no report regarding the impact on male sexual life or sexual function by changes in lifestyle during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Aim To investigate the changes in sexual life and sexual function of Chinese men during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods An online questionnaire was created and the survey was administered through social media to Chinese adult men. Main Outcome Measure The main end point was the deteriorated erectile function or ejaculatory control ability, defined by self-evaluation or by decreased International Index of Erectile Function-5 items (IIEF-5) scores or increased premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) scores. Results Altogether, 612 questionnaires were collected. About 322 (52.6%) subjects were unmarried. About 8.4% and 8.5% subjects reported deteriorated erectile function or ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation, whereas 31.9% and 17.9% subjects showed decreased IIEF-5 scores or increased PEDT scores. Subjects with deteriorated erectile function by self-evaluation and decreased IIEF-5 scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P = .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic, decreased frequency of sexual life (P < .001 and P < .001) and physical exercise (P = .009 and .007) after the epidemic. Subjects with deteriorated ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation and increased PEDT scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P < .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic. Subjects with decreased frequency of sexual life had reduced income (P < .001), increased anxiety (P < .001) and depression (P < .001). Married subjects had higher proportion of improved depression (P = .048) and increased frequency of sexual life (P = .010). Conclusion During the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased sexual function was present in a certain proportion of adult men, and the risk factors include increased anxiety and depression, and decreased frequency of sexual life.

563,"Prevalence of stress, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background The new coronavirus disease's (COVID-19) high risk of infection can increase the workload of healthcare workers, especially nurses, as they are most of the healthcare workforce. These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I2) statistics. Results A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37–49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32–41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31–39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36–50). Conclusion This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions.

Descriptive statistics for demographic and clinical data, CBCL questionnaire scores before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and PSI-SF scores have been computed. Moreover, results of a short phone survey on the psychological burden during COVID lockdown have been reported. Results This study provides the parental-proxy report of emotional and behavioral profile changes of 23 pediatric patients with epilepsy and neurocognitive and emotional comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerns for therapy monitoring at the time of lockdown emerged in 43% of families, and 30% of patients showed worries for an altered contact with the referring medical team. Patients with neurocognitive comorbidities were more likely to exhibit behavioral problems, especially externalizing problems compared with patients with a diagnosis of anxiety/depression. Conclusion Our data suggest the importance to monitor disease trajectory and behavior and affective symptoms with telehealth strategies to provide effective care to patients and their families.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107519,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107519,Scopus,10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107519,2021-02-01,,,

574,Psychological distress among Greater Jakarta area residents during the COVID-19 pandemic and community containment,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic affecting the global population. Community-based quarantine can slow down the pandemic growth while adversely affecting population-wide psychological well-being. Affected psychological well-being could potentially influence population compliance in following stipulated community quarantine procedures. Aim The aim was to quantify psychological distress among Greater Jakarta area residents during the community containment period. Objectives The objective was to measure depression, anxiety, and stress levels using the Indonesian version of the DASS-21. Demographic data on sex, education strata, and working/productive-age group were also collected. Methods This cross-sectional observational analytic study employed an online questionnaire involving participants acquired through snowball sampling. The questionnaire comprises two parts: demographic data and psychological distress indicators. Linear regression evaluated psychological distress as a response variable. Results Among 1,205 women and 824 men, our findings suggested male sex, age in the range of 15-24 years, and having a bachelor's degree or professional qualification have a strong association with psychological distress. Conclusion By addressing the population at risk, policymakers can identify better countermeasures for preventing psychological distress.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06289,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06289,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06289,2021-02-01,,,
575,Factors influencing social distancing to prevent the community spread of COVID-19 among Chinese adults,"The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020 has been an international public health threat. Early strong social distancing efforts is needed to stop transmission of the virus. The purpose of the present study is to identify individual and environmental factors related to individuals' compliance with the recommended social distancing, as well as the moderating role of social media in influencing individuals' implementation of social distancing. A total of 2130 Chinese adults were surveyed in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses were performed to ascertain the predictors of social distancing. Overall, the majority of respondents (95.6%) reported compliance with social distancing. Women were more likely to practice social distancing compared to men (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.93–5.02). Psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and social media were significant predictors of social distancing after controlling for other individual and environmental factors. Social media moderated the effects of psychological distress on social distancing (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94–0.99). Findings from the study indicates that mental health status and social media are influential factors of social distancing, which have significant implications in enhancing the effectiveness of prevention strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106385,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106385,Scopus,10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106385,2021-02-01,,,
576,A commentary on the impact of COVID-19 on engagement of youth with substance use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders,"Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with substance use disorders (SUD) have low rates of engagement and retention in SUD treatment (Mericle et al., 2015). Engagement and retention refers to treatment attendance and regular communication with providers. The reason for this low rate is multifactorial and includes the stigma surrounding SUD and treatment (Bagley, Hadland, Carney, & Saitz, 2017), and challenges accessing developmentally appropriate treatment (Mericle et al., 2015; Sterling, Weisner, Hinman, & Parthasarathy, 2010). Yet engaging AYA early in their trajectory of substance use offers an invaluable opportunity to minimize the short-term and long-term consequences of use (Compton et al., 2019; Levy, Williams, & Prevention, C. on S. U. A., 2016). As specialists in pediatric addiction, we made significant changes in how we provide care for youth in treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the following commentary, we discuss the potential positive and negative impacts of those changes and suggestions for future research.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108175,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108175,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108175,2021-02-01,,,

We experienced a COVID-19 case with prolonged viral shedding for 2 months. His cell mediated immunity has been depressed (CD4+T cell <100/μl) due to advanced malignant lymphoma and chemotherapy which had been completed 4 months prior to the onset of symptoms of COVID-19. We administered several treatments against COVID-19, however the results of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal specimens remained positive to SARS-CoV-2 for 2 months. Moreover, virus isolation assays performed on Day 59 also remained positive. He was finally discharged on Day 69 with two consecutive negative PCR results for SARS-CoV-2.

578,Rapid transitional response to the COVID-19 pandemic by opioid agonist treatment programs in Ukraine,"On March 16, 2020, Ukraine's Ministry of Health issued nonspecific interim guidance to continue enrolling patients in opioid agonist therapies (OAT) and transition existing patients to take-home dosing to reduce community COVID-19 transmission. Though the number of OAT patients increased modestly, the proportion receiving take-home dosing increased from 57.5% to 82.2%, which translates on average to 963,952 fewer clinic interactions annually (range: 728,652–1,016,895) and potentially 80,329 (range: 60,721–84,741) fewer hours of in-person clinical encounters. During the transition, narcologists (addiction specialists) expressed concerns about overdoses, the guidance contradicting existing legislation, and patient dropout, either from incarceration or inadequate public transportation. Though clinicians did observe some overdoses, short-term overall mortality remained similar to the previous year. As the country relaxes the interim guidance, we do not know to what extent governmental guidance or clinical practice will change to adopt the new guidance permanently or revert to pre-guidance regulations. Some future considerations that have come from COVID-19 are should dosing schedules continue to be flexible, should clinicians adopt telehealth, and should there be more overdose education and naloxone distribution? OAT delivery has improved and become more efficient, but clinicians should plan long-term should COVID-19 return in the near future. If the new efficiencies are maintained, it will free the workforce to further scale up OAT.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108164,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108164,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108164,2021-02-01,,,

580,An overview of current mental health in the general population of Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the COLLATE project,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses mental health challenges globally; however, to date, there is limited community level data. This study reports on the COLLATE project (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy), an ongoing study aimed at understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australian mental health and well-being. We addressed prevailing primary concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, current levels of negative emotions and risk factors predicting negative emotions. On April 1st to 4th 2020, 5158 adults from the general public completed an online survey. Participants ranked their top ten current primary concerns about COVID-19, and completed standardized measures of negative emotions. The top three primary concerns were related to health and well-being of family and loved ones. Levels of negative emotion were high. Modelling of predictors of negative emotions established several risk factors related to demographic variables, personal vulnerabilities, financial stresses, and social distancing perceptions; particularly being young, female, or having a mental illness diagnosis. The data provides important characterization of the current Australian mental health. It appears that specific groups may need special attention to ensure their mental health is protected.

582,"Fatal self-injury in the United States, 1999–2018: Unmasking a national mental health crisis","Background Suicides by any method, plus ‘nonsuicide’ fatalities from drug self-intoxication (estimated from selected forensically undetermined and ‘accidental’ deaths), together represent self-injury mortality (SIM)—fatalities due to mental disorders or distress. SIM is especially important to examine given frequent undercounting of suicides amongst drug overdose deaths. We report suicide and SIM trends in the United States of America (US) during 1999–2018, portray interstate rate trends, and examine spatiotemporal (spacetime) diffusion or spread of the drug self-intoxication component of SIM, with attention to potential for differential suicide misclassification. Methods For this state-based, cross-sectional, panel time series, we used de-identified manner and underlying cause-of-death data for the 50 states and District of Columbia (DC) from CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. Procedures comprised joinpoint regression to describe national trends; Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient to assess interstate SIM and suicide rate congruence; and spacetime hierarchical modelling of the ‘nonsuicide’ SIM component. Findings The national annual average percentage change over the observation period in the SIM rate was 4.3% (95% CI: 3.3%, 5.4%; p<0.001) versus 1.8% (95% CI: 1.6%, 2.0%; p<0.001) for the suicide rate. By 2017/2018, all states except Nebraska (19.9) posted a SIM rate of at least 21.0 deaths per 100,000 population—the floor of the rate range for the top 5 ranking states in 1999/2000. The rank-order correlation coefficient for SIM and suicide rates was 0.82 (p<0.001) in 1999/2000 versus 0.34 (p = 0.02) by 2017/2018. Seven states in the West posted a ≥ 5.0% reduction in their standardised mortality ratios of ‘nonsuicide’ drug fatalities, relative to the national ratio, and 6 states from the other 3 major regions a >6.0% increase (p<0.05). Interpretation Depiction of rising SIM trends across states and major regions unmasks a burgeoning national mental health crisis. Geographic variation is plausibly a partial product of local heterogeneity in toxic drug availability and the quality of medicolegal death investigations. Like COVID-19, the nation will only be able to prevent SIM by responding with collective, comprehensive, systemic approaches. Injury surveillance and prevention, mental health, and societal well-being are poorly served by the continuing segregation of substance use disorders from other mental disorders in clinical medicine and public health practice.

583,"Students’ mental health problems before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","The lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic may have exacerbated mental health problems. To what degree mental health may be affected by social isolation is still poorly known. We collected prospective data on students’ mental health in two instances: (i) in October and December 2019, and (ii) 6 months later, in April 2020 amidst the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy and in mid-May/June 2020, after the lifting of lockdown. A total of 358 Italian students aged 18–30 completed socio-demographic questionnaires and the Beck Depression Inventory – 2 (BDI-2), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory – Revised (OCI-R), the Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ), and the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3). We applied multiple regression models to evince any changes in the aforementioned questionnaire scores during and after lockdown with respect to the scores before lockdown. Students reported on average worse depressive symptoms during lockdown than 6 months before isolation (median increase in the BDI-2 score +2; IQR = −3, 6; β = 0.09 ± 0.03, p = 0.005), with students without any established diagnosis of psychopathology being affected the most. The regression models predict that 86.2% (IQR = 67.9, 91.4%) of students would not experience a clinically significant worsening of symptoms, while approximately 6% of our target population could develop more severe depressive symptoms. This study supports the view that depressive symptomatology may be aggravated during lockdown, but also highlights that after the lifting of lockdown any changes quickly vanished, as the BDI-2 scores were not different from the ones reported before lockdown.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.045,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.045,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.045,2021-02-01,,,

Research around the globe shows children and adolescents are suffering from an increased number of depressive symptoms, clinginess, inattention, irritability and worry. This cross-sectional online-based survey type study was aimed to get a snapshot of the prevalence of predictive psychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent population in Bangladesh before and during lockdown. Validated Bangla parent version of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to assess the psychopathology among subjects. Total sample was 552 aged from 4–17 years. Boy-girl ratio was 1.3:1. Prevalence of any predictive psychiatric disorder before lockdown was 20.5 % and within lockdown was 39.7 % and the difference was highly significant (P < 0.001). Prevalence of emotional, conduct disorder and hyperactivity were also increased significantly during the lockdown period than before. Conduct disorder and hyperactivity were more prevalent among boys both before and within lockdown. In contrast, prevalence of emotional disorder was higher among girls before lockdown but within the lockdown period, the boy-girl prevalence was almost the same.

High infection rates and death tolls, combined with social distancing measures, may have unintended psychological consequences on individuals. The goal of this study was to examine the interrelations between COVID-19 exposure, fear of COVID-19, and depression among a community-based sample of adult twins. We further explored whether fear of COVID-19 mediated the association between COVID-19 exposure and depression. 732 same-sex adult twin pairs (78.1% MZ, 21.9% DZ) completed an online survey examining their feelings in May 2020. About one-fifth of the participants reported having any COVID-19 exposure. Most participants (>80%) were somewhat concerned about themselves or their household members being infected by COVID-19. The average depression level was relatively low (M = 0.9 out of 6). We found that COVID-19 exposure was related to increased fears of COVID-19 and depression, and that depressive feelings increased with fear of COVID-19. The correlation between COVID-19 exposure and depression was partially mediated by fear of COVID-19. However, these associations were confounded by familial influences.

592,"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown policy on homicide, suicide, and motor vehicle deaths in Peru","Although lockdown measures to stop COVID-19 have direct effects on disease transmission, their impact on violent and accidental deaths remains unknown. Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.22 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: −14.45, −9.98) and 3.55 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-4.81, −2.30). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was 2.5 the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in homicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 6.66 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:3.18, 10.15). External deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in homicide in men was observed.

In addition to the primary threat of infection, widespread secondary stressors associated with the pandemic have included social isolation, financial insecurity, resource scarcity, and occupational difficulties. Objective The current study examined the impact of these disruptions on psychological distress during the initial adjustment phase to the pandemic in North America. Method A sample of 2463 residents of the US and Canada completed both baseline and follow-up surveys across several weeks between March and May 2020. Results Those participants perceiving stress related to higher levels of personal threat to health and to the well-being of family members at baseline reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for baseline depressive symptoms. In addition, pandemic-related secondary stressors (social isolation, financial insecurity, occupational difficulty, and resource scarcity) were all independently associated with depressive symptoms at follow-up, controlling for both baseline depression and perceived health threats. The results were robust and held up after controlling for demographic factors. Women, young adults, and those who reported lower income were all at higher risk for subsequent depressive symptoms.

Design Cross-sectional telephone interview survey. Setting Academic sleep labs. Participants Iranian adults ≥ 18 years old with confirmed OSA. Results Among 275 participants with OSA, 20% (n = 55) were suspected to have history of COVID-19 but had no positive test, and 18% (n = 51) were in the definite COVID-19 group according to their reported symptoms or confirmed positive test. Having severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index ≥ 30) was associated with an increased risk of definite COVID-19, with an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 2.31 (0.87-5.55) compared to having mild OSA in definite COVID-19 group. Those not undergoing treatment for OSA had an OR (95% CI) of 2.43 (1.26-4.67) for definite COVID-19 compared to those accepting treatment in definite COVID-19 group. Total sleep times (TSTs) were 354, 340, and 320 minutes in healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively; TST was associated with COVID-19 (P-value = .04).

600,The immediate psychological response of the general population in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study,"Background The outbreak of COVID-19 may differentially exacerbate anxiety and stress in people subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Method An online cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the general population’s psychological response during the initial state of the outbreak in Saudi Arabia. The study used brief screening tools PHQ-4 for anxiety-depression symptoms and IES-6 for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Results Among the 584 respondents, 19.8% and 22.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms respectively. According to the combined PHQ-4 score, 14.5% of participants showed moderate to severe anxiety or depression disorder. Overall, 64.8% met the level of clinical concern for posttraumatic stress disorder and 51.3% met the level of probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Multivariate analyses showed that females, non-Saudi nationalities, and those who had a history of mental illness were more vulnerable to anxiety and depression disorders than their counterparts, whereas a higher prevalence of distress symptoms was reported among those who prefer Arabic over English for communication. It was found that people whose colleagues or family infected with the disease were more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression and distress. The study further showed that the higher the perceived threat, the higher the chances of exhibiting anxiety-depressive disorder symptoms and distress symptoms. Conclusion The findings might be a matter for serious concern, and considerable attention is required from authorities and policymakers regarding early detection and treatment of these illnesses in order to reduce the burden of the pandemic related mental illness.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.11.017,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.11.017,Scopus,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.11.017,2021-02-01,,,
601,Different prevalence trend of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers and general public before and after the peak of COVID-19 occurred in China: A meta-analysis,"Objective We aim to evaluate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among general public and healthcare workers during COVID-19 in China and the changes of prevalence before and after the peak of the epidemic occurred. Methods Studies were searched from following database: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WANGFANG DATA, from inception to 1 st May 2020. Random-effects model was applied to pool the prevalence. Comparative analysis was also applied to evaluate the changes of prevalence before and after the peak of the epidemic occurred. Results 34 articles were finally included. Prevalence of depression and anxiety was higher among healthcare worker than general public. Among general public, 26 % (95 %CI: 17 %–36 %) were suffering from depression and 22 % (95 %CI: 15 %–30 %) were having anxiety during COVID-19, while the prevalence of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers was 31 % (95 %CI: 25 %–37 %) and 40 % (95 %CI: 33 %–46 %) respectively. Comparative analysis showed healthcare workers (depression: 40 %, anxiety: 38 %) had higher percentage of having depression and anxiety than the general public (depression: 33 %, anxiety: 24 %) before the peak. Then a descended prevalence among healthcare workers (depression: 22 %, anxiety: 22 %) was detected compared with that before, while the prevalence among the general public raised (depression: 62 %, anxiety: 44 %) after the peak occurred. Conclusion The COVID-19 epidemic had a potential psychiatric impact on general public and healthcare workers in China, which is more severer among healthcare workers. However, the psychiatric status of the general public trend to deteriorated, while healthcare workers trend to improve after the peak of epidemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102547,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102547,Scopus,10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102547,2021-02-01,,,

606,Adapting and avoiding coping strategies for women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for people living with cancer, impacting not only physical health but psychological well-being. The psychological response affects the individual as well as the community and can persist long after the outbreak. We aim to assess coping strategies employed by women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Women with a current or prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey which included a query about coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed from March 30th through April 13, 2020 through survivor networks and social media. Results: Six hundred and three women visited the survey website during the study period and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. Four hundred and eight (73.5%) provided information on coping strategies utilized during COVID-19. Among those who responded, the median age was 58 years (range 20–85) and 150 participants (40.8%) were undergoing active cancer treatment. Commonly utilized adaptive coping strategies included emotional support (159, 39.0%), self care (148, 36.3%), hobbies (139, 34.1%), planning (87, 21.3%), positive reframing (54, 13.2%), religion (50, 12.3%) and instrumental support (38, 9.3%). Many participants also relied on avoidance coping strategies including self distraction (111, 27.2%) and substance use (19, 4.7%). Conclusions: Most ovarian cancer survivors are using adaptive, problem-focused coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, however many are practicing avoidance strategies as well. As coping mechanisms profoundly impact quality of life, oncology providers must assist patients in identifying coping strategies that optimize physical and psychological well-being.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.11.017,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.11.017,Scopus,10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.11.017,2021-02-01,,,
607,Eating to Cope With the COVID-19 Pandemic and Body Weight Change in Young Adults,"Purpose Life disruptions caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic are particularly salient for young adults. Some young adults may engage in unhealthy eating practices to cope with social distancing and isolation during the pandemic, which could increase incidental weight gain. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of eating to cope with the pandemic with body weight change in young adults before versus after spread of COVID-19. Methods Data included the baseline (October/2018–October/2019) and follow-up (May/2020–July/2020) assessments from an ongoing longitudinal cohort recruited from Southern California. A diverse sample of participants (54% Hispanic; age = 19.72[.47] years; N = 1,820) completed online self-report measures of weight at baseline and follow-up and were given a checklist of pandemic coping behaviors including overeating (yes/no) and eating high fat or sugary foods (yes/no) to cope with social distancing and isolation during the pandemic. Results With and without adjusting for confounders, young adults who did versus did not report overeating to cope with the pandemic gained more weight from baseline to follow-up (5.55 vs. 2.54 lbs). Unhealthy food intake to cope with the pandemic was not associated with weight change. Baseline weight moderated the association of eating coping practices with weight change such that individuals with higher baseline weight gained more weight if they engaged in eating to cope behaviors versus not (p’s≤.001). Conclusions Unhealthy eating behavior to cope with the pandemic and corresponding body weight increases may be occurring in young adults. Interventions to promote healthy eating practices in young adults warrant consideration for weight gain prevention during the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.11.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.11.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.11.011,2021-02-01,,,

609,A longitudinal observation of general psychopathology before the COVID-19 outbreak and during lockdown in Italy,"Objective Italy has been largely involved by the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed at evaluating the impact of the lockdown during the pandemic on mental health adopting both a longitudinal and a cross-sectional design. Accordingly, the study investigated general psychopathology a few weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak (T0) and during lockdown (T1), and the associations between lockdown-related environmental conditions, self-perceived worsening in daily living and psychopathology. Methods 130 subjects (aged 18–60 years) were included in the longitudinal design, and an additional subsample of 541 subjects was recruited for the in-lockdown evaluation. Socio-demographic data and the Brief Symptom Inventory were collected both at T0 and T1. Moreover, at T1 an online survey was administered for the evaluation of lockdown-related environmental conditions and self-perceived variations in daily living induced by quarantine, along with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Results Longitudinal analysis showed that phobic anxiety and depressive symptoms increased at T1 as compared with T0, whereas interpersonal sensitivity and paranoid ideation decreased. Pre-existing general psychopathology predicted COVID-19-related post-traumatic symptomatology. Cross-sectional analyses underlined that self-perceived deteriorations in various areas of daily living were associated with general and post-traumatic psychopathology, and with several lockdown-related conditions, especially economic damage. Conclusion The present study underlined a different trend of increased internalizing and decreased interpersonal symptoms during COVID-19 quarantine in Italy. Furthermore, the results showed that subjects with pre-existing psychopathology and those reporting economic damage during the pandemic were more likely to develop deterioration of their mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110328,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110328,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110328,2021-02-01,,,

611,"A rapid review of the pathoetiology, presentation, and management of delirium in adults with COVID-19","Background COVID-19 causes significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the high prevalence of delirium and delirium-related symptoms in COVID-19 patients, data and evidence-based recommendations on the pathophysiology and management of delirium are limited. Objective We conducted a rapid review of COVID-19-related delirium literature to provide a synthesis of literature on the prevalence, pathoetiology, and management of delirium in these patients. Methods Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, LitCovid, WHO-COVID-19, and Web of Science electronic databases were conducted. Grey literature was also reviewed, including preprint servers, archives, and websites of relevant organizations. Search results were limited to the English language. We included literature focused on adults with COVID-19 and delirium. Papers were excluded if they did not mention signs or symptoms of delirium. Results 229 studies described prevalence, pathoetiology, and/or management of delirium in adults with COVID-19. Delirium was rarely assessed with validated tools. Delirium affected >50% of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. The etiology of COVID-19 delirium is likely multifactorial, with some evidence of direct brain effect. Prevention remains the cornerstone of management in these patients. To date, there is no evidence to suggest specific pharmacological strategies. Discussion Delirium is common in COVID-19 and may manifest from both indirect and direct effects on the central nervous system. Further research is required to investigate contributing mechanisms. As there is limited empirical literature on delirium management in COVID-19, management with non-pharmacological measures and judicious use of pharmacotherapy is suggested.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110350,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110350,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110350,2021-02-01,,,
612,Social Connection in Long-Term Care Homes: A Scoping Review of Published Research on the Mental Health Impacts and Potential Strategies During COVID-19,"Objectives Good social connection is associated with better health and wellbeing. However, social connection has distinct considerations for people living in long-term care (LTC) homes. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize research literature linking social connection to mental health outcomes, specifically among LTC residents, as well as research to identify strategies to help build and maintain social connection in this population during COVID-19. Design Scoping review. Settings and Participants Residents of LTC homes, care homes, and nursing homes. Methods We searched MEDLINE(R) ALL (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), Embase and Embase Classic (Ovid), Emcare Nursing (Ovid), and AgeLine (EBSCO) for research that quantified an aspect of social connection among LTC residents; we limited searches to English-language articles published from database inception to search date (July 2019). For the current analysis, we included studies that reported (1) the association between social connection and a mental health outcome, (2) the association between a modifiable risk factor and social connection, or (3) intervention studies with social connection as an outcome. From studies in (2) and (3), we identified strategies that could be implemented and adapted by LTC residents, families and staff during COVID-19 and included the articles that informed these strategies. Results We included 133 studies in our review. We found 61 studies that tested the association between social connection and a mental health outcome. We highlighted 12 strategies, informed by 72 observational and intervention studies, that might help LTC residents, families, and staff build and maintain social connection for LTC residents. Conclusions and Implications Published research conducted among LTC residents has linked good social connection to better mental health outcomes. Observational and intervention studies provide some evidence on approaches to address social connection in this population. Although further research is needed, it does not obviate the need to act given the sudden and severe impact of COVID-19 on social connection in LTC residents.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.11.025,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.11.025,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamda.2020.11.025,2021-02-01,,,

615,Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown in Poland. Specific predictors and differences in symptoms severity,"Background Previous studies carried out in different countries have indicated that young adults experienced higher levels of emotional distress, in the form of depressive and anxiety symptoms, than older age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about which pandemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. Purpose The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in four age groups in the Polish population during the COVID-19 lockdown; (ii) differences in perceived difficulties related to the pandemic in these groups; and (iii) which factors and difficulties related to the pandemic are the best predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method A total of 1115 participants (aged 18–85) took part in the study. The sample was representative of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed the following online: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, a Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, a Social Support Scale, and a Scale of Pandemic-Related Difficulties. Results Younger age groups (18–29 and 30–44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45–59 and 60–85 years). Household relationship difficulties were among the most significant predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus was one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18 and 29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms exclusively in the youngest group. Conclusions The youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members are the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. It is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the various challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152222,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152222,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152222,2021-02-01,,,
616,Remote monitoring for heart failure management during COVID-19 pandemic,"Background COVID-19 pandemic impacted on heart failure patients’ lifestyle and quality of life, affecting both physical activity levels and state of health. Methods Demographic data and device records were extracted for patients with heart failure in the 16 weeks at the turn of lockdown during pandemic. To explore the variability across the lockdown period, a week-to-week analysis was performed. Patients were interviewed to investigate physical activity and psychological insights. The primary endpoint was the variation in physical activity at the turn of lockdown. Results At our facility, 2225 patients implanted with a cardiac device were screened and data were collected for 211 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Patients’ physical activity significantly decreased in the lockdown period compared with the control period (active time per day 8.0% vs. 10.8%; relative reduction [RRR] 25.9%; p < 0.0001). A small decrease was noted for mean heart rate (70.1 vs. 71.7 beats per minute [bpm]; RRR 2.2%; p < 0.0001), while thoracic impedance slightly increased (82.2 vs. 82.7 ohm; RRR 0.6%; p = 0.001). Patients’ physical activity decreased from week 7 to week 11 (10.9% vs. 6.9%; RRR 36.7%; P < 0.0001) with an increase between week 11 and week 16 (6.9% vs. 8.5%; RRR 18.8%; P < 0.0001). Patients’ perceptions about physical activity showed a very low correlation with remote monitoring-assessed physical activity levels (r2 = 0.035, p = 0.039).

621,The effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing relaxation training for improving sleep quality among nursing staff during the COVID-19 outbreak: a before and after study,"Objectives Recent studies have demonstrated that first-line nurses involved in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) crisis may experience sleep disturbances. As breathing relaxation techniques can improve sleep quality, anxiety, and depression, the current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing relaxation training (DBRT) for improving sleep quality among nurses in Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods This study used a quasi-experimental (before and after) intervention strategy, with 151 first-line nurses from four wards in Leishenshan hospital. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) to evaluate the effectiveness of DBRT before and after the intervention. Data were examined using the Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, and paired t-test. Results A total of 140 nurses completed the DBRT sessions. First-line nurses achieved significant reductions in global sleep quality (p < 0.01), subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001), sleep latency (p < 0.01), sleep duration (p < 0.001), sleep disturbances (p < 0.001), habitual sleep efficiency (p = 0.015), daytime dysfunction (p = 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001). There were no significant reductions in the use of sleeping medication (p = 0.134) and depression (p = 0.359). Conclusion DBRT is a useful non-pharmacological treatment for improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety among first-line nurses involved in the COVID-19 outbreak.

We also explore potential explanations for these health issues by analyzing baseline qualitative data. Results All students, on average, were suffering from perceived stress and anxiety, with especially high levels in April. We also identified inequalities in college student mental well-being, particularly by gender identity and sexual orientation. Women reported worse well-being compared with men; transgender and gender diverse and sexual minority youths reported worse outcomes than their cisgender, heterosexual peers at both time points. Qualitative data illustrate how the COVID-19 pandemic has generated educational, economic, and environmental stressors that are affecting college students' well-being. Conclusions As colleges and universities think about how to manage and mitigate the infectious disease dimensions of COVID-19 among their student populations, they must also consider who is most at risk for increased stress and anxiety during the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.030,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.030,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.030,2021-02-01,,,

628,"Dyspnea, Acute Respiratory Failure, Psychological Trauma, and Post-ICU Mental Health: A Caution and a Call for Research","Dyspnea is an uncomfortable sensation with the potential to cause psychological trauma. Patients presenting with acute respiratory failure, particularly when tidal volume is restricted during mechanical ventilation, may experience the most distressing form of dyspnea known as air hunger. Air hunger activates brain pathways known to be involved in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. These conditions are considered part of the post-intensive care syndrome. These sequelae may be even more prevalent among patients with ARDS. Low tidal volume, a mainstay of modern therapy for ARDS, is difficult to avoid and is likely to cause air hunger despite sedation. Adjunctive neuromuscular blockade does not prevent or relieve air hunger, but it does prevent the patient from communicating discomfort to caregivers. Consequently, paralysis may also contribute to the development of PTSD. Although research has identified post-ARDS PTSD as a cause for concern, and investigators have taken steps to quantify the burden of disease, there is little information to guide mechanical ventilation strategies designed to reduce its occurrence. We suggest such efforts will be more successful if they are directed at the known mechanisms of air hunger. Investigation of the antidyspnea effects of sedative and analgesic drugs commonly used in the ICU and their impact on post-ARDS PTSD symptoms is a logical next step. Although in practice we often accept negative consequences of life-saving therapies as unavoidable, we must understand the negative sequelae of our therapies and work to minimize them under our primary directive to “first, do no harm” to patients.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.09.251,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.09.251,Scopus,10.1016/j.chest.2020.09.251,2021-02-01,,,
629,Systematic Review of COVID-19 Related Myocarditis: Insights on Management and Outcome,"Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also referred to as COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The manifestations of COVID-19 are widely variable and range from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure and death. Like other viral illnesses, acute myocarditis has been reported to be associated with COVID-19 infection. However, guidelines for the diagnosis of COVID-19 myocarditis have not been established. Methods Using a combination of search terms in the PubMed/Medline, Ovid Medline and the Cochrane Library databases and manual searches on Google Scholar and the bibliographies of articles identified, we reviewed all cases reported in the English language citing myocarditis associated with COVID-19 infection. Results Fourteen records comprising a total of fourteen cases that report myocarditis/myopericarditis secondary to COVID-19 infection were identified. There was a male predominance (58%), with the median age of the cases described being 50.4 years. The majority of patients did not have a previously identified comorbid condition (50%), but of those with a past medical history, hypertension was most prevalent (33%). Electrocardiogram findings were variable, and troponin was elevated in 91% of cases. Echocardiography was performed in 83% of cases reduced function was identified in 60%. Endotracheal intubation was performed in the majority of cases. Glucocorticoids were most commonly used in treatment of myocarditis (58%). Majority of patients survived to discharge (81%) and 85% of those that received steroids survived to discharge. Conclusion Guidelines for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 myocarditis have not been established and our knowledge on management is rapidly changing. The use of glucocorticoids and other agents including IL-6 inhibitors, IVIG and colchicine in COVID-19 myocarditis is debatable. In our review, there appears to be favorable outcomes related to myocarditis treated with steroid therapy. However, until larger scale studies are conducted, treatment approaches have to be made on an individualized case-by-case basis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2020.08.028,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2020.08.028,Scopus,10.1016/j.carrev.2020.08.028,2021-02-01,,,

631,“It's an emotional roller coaster… But sometimes it's fucking awesome”: Meaning and motivation of work for peers in overdose response environments in British Columbia,"Background The province of British Columbia (BC), Canada is amid dual public health emergencies in which the overdose epidemic declared in 2016 has been exacerbated by restrictions imposed by the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Experiential workers, commonly known as ‘peers’ (workers with past or present drug use experience) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives and are essential in creating safe spaces for people who use drugs (PWUD) in harm reduction. Working in overdose response environments can be stressful, with lasting emotional and mental health effects. There is limited knowledge about the personal meaning that experiential workers derive from their work, which serve as motivators for them to take on these often-stressful roles. Methods This project used a community-based qualitative research design. The research was based at two organizations in BC. Eight experiential worker-led focus groups were conducted (n = 31) where participants spoke about their roles, positive aspects of their jobs, challenges they face, and support needs in harm reduction work. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using interpretative description to uncover the meaning derived from experiential work. Results Three themes emerged from focus group data that describe the meanings which serve as motivators for experiential workers to continue working in overdose response environments: (1) A sense of purpose from helping others; (2) Being an inspiration for others, and; (3) A sense of belonging. Conclusion Despite the frequent hardships and loss that accompany overdose response work, experiential workers identified important aspects that give their work meaning. These aspects of their work may help to protect workers from the emotional harms associated with stressful work as well as the stigma of substance use. Recognizing the importance of experiential work and its role in the lives of PWUD can help inform and strengthen organizational supports.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103015,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103015,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103015,2021-02-01,,,

634,"COVID-19 Pandemic and the Lived Experience of Surgical Residents, Fellows, and Early-Career Surgeons in the American College of Surgeons","Background To better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected surgical trainees' and early-career surgeons' professional and personal experiences, a survey of the membership of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Resident and Associate Society (RAS) and Young Fellows Association (YFA) was performed. Study Design An anonymous online survey was disseminated to members of RAS and YFA. Descriptive analyses were performed and factors associated with depression and burnout were examined with univariate and multivariable stepwise logistic regression. Results Of the RAS/YFA membership of 21,385, there were 1,160 respondents. The majority of respondents (96%) reported the COVID-19 pandemic having a negative impact on their clinical experience, with 84% of residents reporting a > 50% reduction in operative volume and inability to meet minimum case requirements. Respondents also reported negative impacts on personal wellness. Nearly one-third reported inadequate access to personal protective equipment, and depression and burnout were pervasive (≥21% of respondents reported yes to every screening symptom). On multivariable analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.54 for depression, OR 1.47 for burnout) and lack of wellness resources (OR 1.55 for depression, OR 1.44 for burnout) predicted depression and burnout. Access to adequate personal protective equipment was protective against burnout (OR 0.52). Conclusions These data demonstrate a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of residents and early-career surgeons.

635,"The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with and without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders: a longitudinal study of three Dutch case-control cohorts","Background The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in people with pre-existing mental health disorders is unclear. In three psychiatry case-control cohorts, we compared the perceived mental health impact and coping and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic between people with and without lifetime depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. Methods Between April 1 and May 13, 2020, online questionnaires were distributed among the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association cohorts, including people with (n=1181) and without (n=336) depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The questionnaire contained questions on perceived mental health impact, fear of COVID-19, coping, and four validated scales assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness used in previous waves during 2006–16. Number and chronicity of disorders were based on diagnoses in previous waves. Linear regression and mixed models were done. Findings The number and chronicity of disorders showed a positive graded dose–response relation, with greater perceived impact on mental health, fear, and poorer coping. Although people with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders scored higher on all four symptom scales than did individuals without these mental health disorders, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, they did not report a greater increase in symptoms during the pandemic. In fact, people without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders showed a greater increase in symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas individuals with the greatest burden on their mental health tended to show a slight symptom decrease. Interpretation People with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders are experiencing a detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires close monitoring in clinical practice. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their prepandemic levels.

638,Nutritional status assessment in patients with Covid-19 after discharge from the intensive care unit,"Introduction The nutritional diagnosis and early nutritional management of COVID-19 patients must be integrated into the overall therapeutic strategy. The aim of our study is to assess the nutritional status of patients with COVID-19 after a stay in intensive care, to describe the prevalence of undernutrition, to determine the factors influencing undernutrition and to describe the nutritional management. Tools and methods This is a descriptive observational study of adult patients admitted to the endocrinology service for additional care after a stay in intensive care during the period from April 17, 2020 to May 26, 2020. The assessment tool used was the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Results Our study included 41 patients; the average age of the patients was 55 years, 51.2% had a severe or critical form of COVID-19, 75.6% stayed in intensive care, 12.2% had a loss of autonomy. The average BMI was 25.2 kg/m2 (17–42 kg/m2), 42.5% were overweight, 61% had weight loss, 26.2% had weight loss greater than 10%, 14.6% of our patients were undernourished, 65.9% were at risk of undernutrition, 19.5% had hypoalbuminemia, 17.1% had hypoprotidemia, 19.5% hypocalcemia, 34.1% anemia, 12.2% hypomagnesemia and 51.2% had a deficiency in vitamin D. A positive correlation was found between poor nutritional status and a longer stay in intensive care (>5 days) (p = 0.011) and lymphopenia (p = 0,02). Conclusion Despite a personalized diet, 14.6% of patients presented undernutrition.

641,Prevalence and associated factors of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and has caused traumatic experience for nurses worldwide. However, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in nurses, and how psychosocial factors influence nurses in this public crisis are unknown. Objectives To determine the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of nurses and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses in China during the outbreak. Design A cross-sectional study. Settings and participants A total of 3,228 nurses in Sichuan Province and Wuhan City were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were invited to complete the questionnaire through WeChat from January 27 to February 3, 2020. Methods A self-reported questionnaire combining depression and anxiety scale was used to collect data anonymously. Binary and multivariate logistic regression was applied to measure the odds of psychosocial factors of anxiety and depression and perceived health, respectively. Results The total incidence of depression (34.3%) and anxiety (18.1%) during the COVID-19 outbreak was lower than that during the SARS outbreak; however, the rate of depression in our study (47.1%) was high and similar in a recent study (50.4%) about the health care workers exposed to COVID-19 in China. The results indicated that COVID-19-related stress, relationship quality with family, and demographic characteristics were associated with depression, anxiety, and perceived health status. Furthermore, the prevalence of depression was similar between nurses working in low-risk COVID-19 wards was as high as working in high-risk COVID-19 wards (OR, 1.078; 95% CI, 0.784–1.481). Conclusions Our study revealed the high prevalence of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19. COVID-19 factors and psychosocial factors were associated with mental health of nurses.

643,Psychological and Sexual Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Egypt: Are Women Suffering More?,"Introduction Psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic include pandemic triggered feelings of fear, uncertainty, and anxiety added to the effects of restricting the population's activities in lockdown. Aim We aimed to study the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on sexual satisfaction of females and males in Egypt and to evaluate possible predictive factors. Methods Married men and females in Egypt were invited to respond to an online questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed medical history, socioeconomic status, sexual performance satisfaction before and during the lockdown in addition to validated Arabic questionnaires for depression, sexual function in males and females, and sexual satisfaction (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function-5, Index of Sexual Satisfaction, respectively). Main outcome measure The main outcome measures were frequency of depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and sexual satisfaction in males and females during COVID-19 lockdown. Results A total of 479 females and 217 males completed the questionnaire. Sexual satisfaction was significantly higher before (91.2%, 73.5%) than during lockdown (70.5%, 56.2%) in both males and females, respectively. During lockdown, significantly more males (70.5%) reported being satisfied with their sexual performance than females (56.2%) (P < .001). More than half of the male subjects (68.2%) had no erectile dysfunction while 97.3% females scored ≤26.5 on the Female Sexual Function Index scale suggestive of sexual difficulties. Sexual stress was significantly greater in females (70.8%) than males (63.1%). Educational level, occupation, anxiety, and erectile dysfunction were independently associated with sexual stress in males. Being a housewife or unemployed, husband's age >35 years, marriage duration of 5-10 years, anxiety, and female sexual dysfunction were predictors of sexual relation stress in females. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower sexual satisfaction in both genders. Females however suffered more anxiety and depression and thereby greater risk of sexual function difficulties and sexual dissatisfaction. Intervention strategies in order to lessen the suffering of affected individuals particularly after the pandemic are recommended. Omar SS, Dawood W, Eid N, et al.

647,Adaptations of an outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the confinement on patients with borderline personality disorder,"Objectif La pandémie due à la COVID-19 a impacté l’accessibilité à la psychothérapie pour des patients particulièrement vulnérables pendant la période de confinement. Nous présentons les adaptations d’un programme de thérapie comportementale dialectique et les conséquences du confinement sur le vécu de patients souffrant d’un trouble de personnalité borderline. Méthode Nous avons, pour sept patients, comparé deux périodes de huit semaines, avant et pendant le confinement. Nous avons analysé leurs cartes journalières (n =426) et le recensement hebdomadaire de la fréquence de leurs comportements problèmes (n =69). Résultats L’analyse des cartes journalières indique que la période de confinement prédit une diminution significative des sentiments de peur, de honte ou culpabilité et de tension mais une augmentation de la détresse. Le suivi hebdomadaire montre une diminution significative des comportements hyperphagiques. Discussion Malgré le petit nombre de patients inclus, cette étude se base sur des échantillonnages d’expérience au quotidien et des mesures hebdomadaires. Ces deux types de mesures répétées indiquent certaines améliorations pendant le confinement, attestant des capacités d’adaptation de ces patients, soutenus par un cadre thérapeutique intensif qui a été maintenu. Background The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement. Method We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (n =426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n =69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations. Results The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7 %) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m=30.9 [10.0]) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m=15.0 [5.0]). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement. Conclusions Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,2021-02-01,,,

650,Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: retrospective cohort studies of 62 354 COVID-19 cases in the USA,"Background Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62 354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69·8 million patients. TriNetX included 62 354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between Jan 20, and Aug 1, 2020. We created cohorts of patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a range of other health events. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for severity of illness. We measured the incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for psychiatric disorders, dementia, and insomnia, during the first 14 to 90 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19. Findings In patients with no previous psychiatric history, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with increased incidence of a first psychiatric diagnosis in the following 14 to 90 days compared with six other health events (HR 2·1, 95% CI 1·8–2·5 vs influenza; 1·7, 1·5–1·9 vs other respiratory tract infections; 1·6, 1·4–1·9 vs skin infection; 1·6, 1·3–1·9 vs cholelithiasis; 2·2, 1·9–2·6 vs urolithiasis, and 2·1, 1·9–2·5 vs fracture of a large bone; all p<0·0001). The HR was greatest for anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia. We observed similar findings, although with smaller HRs, when relapses and new diagnoses were measured. The incidence of any psychiatric diagnosis in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 18·1% (95% CI 17·6–18·6), including 5·8% (5·2–6·4) that were a first diagnosis. The incidence of a first diagnosis of dementia in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 1·6% (95% CI 1·2–2·1) in people older than 65 years. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (relative risk 1·65, 95% CI 1·59–1·71; p<0·0001). This risk was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but we cannot exclude possible residual confounding by socioeconomic factors. Interpretation Survivors of COVID-19 appear to be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, and a psychiatric diagnosis might be an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Although preliminary, our findings have implications for clinical services, and prospective cohort studies are warranted.

651,Trajectories of anxiety and depressive symptoms during enforced isolation due to COVID-19 in England: a longitudinal observational study,"Background There is major concern about the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak on mental health. Several studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries before and during enforced isolation (ie, lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed week by week over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the trajectories of anxiety and depression over the 20 weeks after lockdown was announced in England, and compare the growth trajectories by individual characteristics. Methods In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we analysed data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a panel study weighted to population proportions, which collects information on anxiety (using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment) and depressive symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire) weekly in the UK since March 21, 2020. We included data from adults living in England who had at least three repeated measures between March 23 and Aug 9, 2020. Analyses were done using latent growth models, which were fitted to account for sociodemographic and health covariates. Findings Between March 23, and Aug 9, data from over 70 000 adults were collected in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. When including participants living in England with three follow-up measures and no missing values, our analytic sample consisted of 36 520 participants. The average depression score was 6·6 (SD=6·0, range 0–27) and the average anxiety score 5·7 (SD=5·6, range 0–21) in week 1. Anxiety and depression levels both declined across the first 20 weeks following the introduction of lockdown in England (b=–1·93, SE=0·26, p<0·0001 for anxiety; b=–2·52, SE=0·28, p<0·0001 for depressive symptoms). The fastest decreases were seen across the strict lockdown period (between weeks 2 and 5), with symptoms plateauing as further lockdown easing measures were introduced (between weeks 16 and 20). Being a woman or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income, or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depression at the start of lockdown. Many of these inequalities in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued, but differences were still evident 20 weeks after the start of lockdown. Interpretation These data suggest that the highest levels of depression and anxiety occurred in the early stages of lockdown but declined fairly rapidly, possibly because individuals adapted to circumstances. Our findings emphasise the importance of supporting individuals in the lead-up to future lockdowns to try to reduce distress, and highlight that groups already at risk for poor mental health before the pandemic have remained at risk throughout lockdown and its aftermath.

654,Does public fear that bats spread COVID-19 jeopardize bat conservation?,"With >1 400 species, bats comprise the second-largest order of mammals and provide critical ecological services as insect consumers, pollinators, and seed dispersers. Yet, bats are frequently associated with infectious human diseases such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola. As early as the end of January 2020, several virological studies have suggested bats as a probable origin for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. How does the public view the role of bats in COVID-19? Here we report pilot data collected shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19 using two online surveys, combined with a conservation intervention experiment, primarily on people who are receiving or have received higher education in China. We found that 84% of the participants of an online survey (n = 13 589) have misunderstood the relationship between bats and COVID-19, which strengthened negative attitudes towards bats. Knowledge of bats, gender, and education level of the participants affected their attitudes towards bats. Participants who indicated a better knowledge of bats had a more positive attitude towards bats. The proportion of female participants who had negative attitudes towards bats was higher than that of male participants. Participants with a higher education level indicated a more positive attitude towards bats after the outbreak of COVID-19. A specially prepared bat conservation lecture improved peoples' knowledge of bats and the positive attitudes, but failed to correct the misconception that bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans directly. We suggest that the way virologists frame the association of bats with diseases, the countless frequently inaccurate media coverages, and the natural perceptual bias of bats carrying and transmitting diseases to humans contributed to the misunderstandings. This probably led to a rise in the events of evicting bats from dwellings and structures by humans and the legislative proposal for culling disease-relevant wildlife in China. A better understanding of the relationship between disease, wildlife and human health could help guide the public and policymakers in an improved program for bat conservation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108952,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108952,Scopus,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108952,2021-02-01,,,

661,ACE2 and FURIN variants are potential predictors of SARS-CoV-2 outcome: A time to implement precision medicine against COVID-19,"The severity of the new COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is strikingly variable in different global populations. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor, TMPRSS2 protease, and FURIN peptidase to invade human cells. Here, we investigated 1,378 whole-exome sequences of individuals from the Middle Eastern populations (Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran) to explore natural variations in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN genes. We identified two activating variants (K26R and N720D) in the ACE2 gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle Eastern, East Asian, and African populations. We postulate that K26R can activate ACE2 and facilitate binding to S-protein RBD while N720D enhances TMPRSS2 cutting and, ultimately, viral entry. We also detected deleterious variants in FURIN that are frequent in the Middle Eastern but not in the European populations. This study highlights specific genetic variations in the ACE2 and FURIN genes that may explain SARS-CoV-2 clinical disparity. We showed structural evidence of the functionality of these activating variants that increase the SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness. Finally, our data illustrate a significant correlation between ACE2 variants identified in people from Middle Eastern origins that can be further explored to explain the variation in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates globally.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06133,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06133,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06133,2021-02-01,,,

673,"Increased mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption during the spring of 2020. Many college students were told to leave campus at spring break and to complete the semester remotely. This study evaluates effects of this disruption on student well-being. Measures of psychological symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use during the pandemic were completed by 148 students in spring 2020 and 352 students in fall 2020 at a university in the southeastern U.S. Results from both cohorts were compared to 240 students who completed the same measures in the fall 2019 semester. Participants in spring 2020 reported more mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use than did pre-pandemic participants and worry about COVID-19 was negatively associated with well-being. By fall 2020 symptoms had largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. In general, White students reported a greater effect of the pandemic on well-being than did African American students. Young adults appear to be less vulnerable to the most serious medical complications associated with COVID-19, but nonetheless experience psychological effects from the pandemic.

683,Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the pediatric population from the family and community perspective,"Partiendo del informe sobre la situación de la COVID-19 en España, del 3 de abril del 2020, los casos confirmados ascienden a 117.710, de los que 343 tienen una edad inferior a 14 años (< 1%). Es fundamental conocer la especificidad de este proceso en la población infantil, así como las recomendaciones específicas para una adecuada prevención y cuidado de los niños durante la pandemia por la COVID-19. Este artículo tiene como objetivo analizar la evidencia científica sobre las recomendaciones específicas para la atención pediátrica en casos de COVID-19 desde el ámbito familiar y comunitario. Se han seleccionado y analizado las principales recomendaciones y medidas preventivas en los entornos de Atención Primaria de salud y el domicilio desde un enfoque integrador dónde se incluyen los aspectos biopsicosociales del niño durante el confinamiento. La importancia de los cuidados de la infancia frente a la enfermedad radican sobre todo en asegurar las correctas medidas de prevención del contagio por la condición de actuar como posibles portadores durante un período de incubación de hasta 21 días. La recomendación es que los niños participen activamente en las acciones preventivas habituales para la contención de la expansión de la enfermedad. A nivel domiciliario, el aislamiento supone un importante reto para las familias donde se presentan manifestaciones de incertidumbre, miedo e indefensión ante los cambios y entre las recomendaciones se encuentran establecer rutinas orden mediante horarios de actividades y ocio unido a las medidas de higiene. Dada la rapidez con la que se ha producido la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2, existen pocas evidencias del impacto en niños en España por el momento. Es necesario desarrollar estudios específicos sobre prevención y tratamiento en la edad pediátrica para mejorar las recomendaciones disponibles. Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (< 1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures. Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment. Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.005,2021-02-01,,,

688,The COVID-19 Pandemic as a Traumatic Stressor: Mental Health Responses of Older Adults With Chronic PTSD,"Objective Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who experience additional traumas or stressful life events may undergo symptomatic worsening, but no data exist on whether exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic in a high infection area worsens mental health among older adults with chronic PTSD. Methods Seventy-six older adults (N = 46 with PTSD and N = 30 trauma-exposed comparison subjects [TE]) for whom prepandemic data were available were interviewed between April 1 and May 8, 2020 to quantify depressive (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD]) and PTSD symptom (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist [PCL-5]) levels. Group differences in baseline characteristics as well as pre-post pandemic symptom levels were examined, and participant characteristics were assessed as moderators of symptom change. Results Compared to TEs, individuals with PTSD more often reported living alone and experiencing a physical illness (χ2 = 5.1, df = 1, p = 0.02). PCL-5 scores among individuals with PTSD decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic by 7.1 points (t(69) = -3.5, p = 0.0008), whereas the TE group did not change significantly. Overall no significant differences in HRSD were found between groups, but a race or ethnicity variable was found to moderate HRSD symptom change. Non-black or Hispanic individuals with PTSD experienced significantly increased HRSD scores during the pandemic compared to black or Hispanic PTSD participants. Conclusion The findings are indicative of complexity in the responses of older individuals with PTSD to further stressful life events as well as possibly unique aspects to the COVID-19 pandemic as a stressor. Sources of resilience may exist based on experience with prior traumas as well as increasing age promoting more adaptive coping styles.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.010,2021-02-01,,,
689,"Comparing actual and forecasted numbers of unique patients dispensed select medications for opioid use disorder, opioid overdose reversal, and mental health, during the COVID-19 pandemic, United States, January 2019 to May 2020","Background COVID-19 community mitigation measures (e.g., stay-at-home orders) may worsen mental health and substance use-related harms such as opioid use disorder and overdose and limit access to medications for these conditions. We used nationally-representative data to assess dispensing of select substance use and mental health medications during the pandemic in the U.S. Methods IQVIA Total Patient Tracker data were used to calculate U.S. monthly numbers of unique patients dispensed buprenorphine, extended-release (ER) intramuscular naltrexone, naloxone, selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and for comparison, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) between January 2019-May 2020. Forecasted estimates of number of unique patients dispensed medications, generated by exponential smoothing statistical forecasting, were compared to actual numbers of patients by month to examine access during mitigation measures (March 2020-May 2020). Results Between March 2020-May 2020, numbers of unique patients dispensed buprenorphine and numbers dispensed naloxone were within forecasted estimates. Numbers dispensed ER intramuscular naltrexone were significantly below forecasted estimates in March 2020 (-1039; 95 %CI:-1528 to -550), April 2020 (-2139; 95 %CI:-2629 to -1650), and May 2020 (-2498; 95 %CI:-2987 to -2009). Numbers dispensed antidepressants and benzodiazepines were significantly above forecasted estimates in March 2020 (977,063; 95 %CI:351,384 to 1,602,743 and 450,074; 95 % CI:189,999 to 710,149 additional patients, respectively), but were within forecasted estimates in April 2020-May 2020. Dispensing patterns for statins and ARBs were similar to those for antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Conclusions Ongoing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use and mental health underscore the need for innovative strategies to facilitate continued access to treatment.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108486,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108486,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108486,2021-02-01,,,
690,Safety signals for QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes associated with azithromycin with or without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine,"Background Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not assessed potential risks. Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of ≥2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016,2021-02-01,,,
691,Alcohol use and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study in a sample of UK adults,"Background The aim was to examine the correlates of increased alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions that were implemented in a sample of UK adults. Methods This paper presents analyses of data from a cross-sectional study. Adults aged 18 years and over, residing in the UK and self-isolating from others outside their own household were eligible to participate. Participants reported increase or no increase in their level of alcohol consumption from before to during lockdown, as well as symptoms of anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing. Socio-demographic characteristics were compared between adults with and without reported increased alcohol consumption. The associations between reported increased alcohol consumption and mental health outcomes were investigated using logistic and linear regression analyses. Results 691 adults (61.1 % women; 48.8 % aged 35−64 years) were included in the analysis. Of these, 17 % reported increased alcohol consumption after lockdown. A higher proportion of 18−34-year olds reported increased alcohol consumption compared to older groups. The prevalence of poor overall mental health was significantly higher in individuals with increased alcohol consumption (vs. no increase) (45.4 % versus 32.7 %; p-value = 0.01). There was a significant association between increased alcohol consumption and poor overall mental health (OR = 1.64; 95 % CI = 1.01, 2.66), depressive symptoms (unstandardized beta = 2.93; 95 % CI = 0.91, 4.95) and mental wellbeing (unstandardized beta=-1.38; 95 % CI=-2.38, -0.39). Conclusions More than one in six UK adults increased their alcohol consumption during lockdown and a higher proportion of these were younger adults. Increased alcohol consumption was independently associated with poor overall mental health, increased depressive symptoms and lower mental wellbeing. These findings highlight the importance of planning targeted support as we emerge from lockdown and plan for potential second and subsequent waves.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108488,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108488,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108488,2021-02-01,,,

The performance of this research was under real conditions producing results that conform to natural human diurnal and seasonal rhythm patterns. The derived results of this, 208 million data research on diurnal emotions, valence and facial temperature correlate with the results of an analogical Twitter research performed worldwide (UK, Australia, US, Canada, Latin America, North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia). It is established that diurnal valence and sadness were correlated with one another both prior to and during the period of the coronavirus crisis, and that there are statistically significant relationships between the values of diurnal happiness, sadness, valence and facial temperature and the numbers of their data.

702,Psychological correlates of poor sleep quality among U.S. young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective Uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in problematic sleep that can lead to negative effects on overall health. This unprecedented and stressful time can be even more detrimental for young adults with pre-existing mental health conditions. The purpose of this study is to investigate potential risk factors (i.e., current mental health symptoms, and COVID-19-related grief and worry) on sleep quality of U.S. young adults during the initial months of the global pandemic. Method This cross-sectional study examined 908 young adults in the weeks following the declaration of the coronavirus pandemic as a national emergency by the United States. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses examined depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as COVID-19-related grief and worry as predictors of young adults’ sleep quality. Results Young adults experienced high rates of sleep problems during the first two months (April to May 2020) of the pandemic. Depressive and anxiety symptoms appear to be predictors of sleep quality regardless of any pre-existing diagnosis. Furthermore, high levels of PTSD symptoms and COVID-19-related worry were associated with young adults’ poor sleep. Conclusions Our findings point to possible psychological factors that uniquely explain young adults’ poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. This study shed new light on how the COVID-19 pandemic might affect the sleep behaviors of young adults without a pre-existing mental health diagnosis.

To investigate the depression and anxiety symptoms and their associations with problematic smartphone use under the COVID-19 epidemic, a total of 847 Chinese undergraduate students joined in this study and were measured with their levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, resilience, perceived social support, the sense of school belonging and problematic smartphone use. Results showed that among the Chinese undergraduate students, the disorder rates of depression and anxiety symptoms were 29.16% and 46.64% respectively, and their symptoms ranged from mild to extreme severe. Depression and anxiety symptoms both positively predicted problematic smartphone use.

707,Home garden use during COVID-19: Associations with physical and mental wellbeing in older adults,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of people's lives. Lockdown measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have been more stringent for those aged over 70, at highest risk for the disease. Here, we examine whether home garden usage is associated with self-reported mental and physical wellbeing in older adults, during COVID-19 lockdown in Scotland. This study analysed data from 171 individuals (mean age 84 ± 0.5 years) from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study who completed an online survey approximately two months after lockdown commenced (May/June, 2020), and reported having access to a home garden. The survey also included items on garden activities (gardening, relaxing), frequency of garden usage during lockdown, and measures of self-rated physical health, emotional and mental health, anxiety about COVID-19, and sleep quality. Ordinal regression models were adjusted for sex, living alone, education, occupational social class, anxiety and depressive symptoms, body mass index, and history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Neither gardening nor relaxing in the garden were associated with health outcomes. However, higher frequency of garden usage during lockdown was associated with better self-rated physical health (P = 0.005), emotional and mental health (P = 0.04), sleep quality (P = 0.03), and a composite health score (P = 0.001), after adjusting for covariates. None of the garden measures were associated with perceived change in physical health, mental and emotional health, or sleep quality, from pre-lockdown levels. The results of the current study provide support for positive health benefits of spending time in a garden—though associations may be bidirectional—and suggest that domestic gardens could be a potential health resource during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101545,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101545,Scopus,10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101545,2021-02-01,,,
708,Socioeconomic factors analysis for COVID-19 US reopening sentiment with Twitter and census data,"Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users (e.g., positive, negative) towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel patterns due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 50 States of the US and Washington D.C, the capital city of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of family members and high income are less interested in reopening the economy. The accuracy of the model is reasonable (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi-squared test indicates that this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides clear insights for public and corporate policymakers on potential areas to allocate resources, and directional guidance on potential policy options they can undertake to improve socioeconomic conditions, to mitigate the impact of pandemic in the current situation, and in the future as well.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06200,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06200,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06200,2021-02-01,,,

714,"COVID-19 and its impact on education, social life and mental health of students: A survey","The outbreak of COVID-19 affected the lives of all sections of society as people were asked to self-quarantine in their homes to prevent the spread of the virus. The lockdown had serious implications on mental health, resulting in psychological problems including frustration, stress, and depression. In order to explore the impacts of this pandemic on the lives of students, we conducted a survey of a total of 1182 individuals of different age groups from various educational institutes in Delhi- National Capital Region (NCR), India. The article identified the following as the impact of COVID-19 on the students of different age groups: time spent on online classes and self-study, medium used for learning, sleeping habits, daily fitness routine, and the subsequent effects on weight, social life, and mental health. Moreover, our research found that in order to deal with stress and anxiety, participants adopted different coping mechanisms and also sought help from their near ones. Further, the research examined the student’s engagement on social media platforms among different age categories. This study suggests that public authorities should take all the necessary measures to enhance the learning experience by mitigating the negative impacts caused due to the COVID-19 outbreak.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105866,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105866,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105866,2021-02-01,,,
715,Identifying the impact of the confinement of Covid-19 on emotional-mood and behavioural dimensions in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"The current study examined the impact of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 disease on mood state and behaviours of children and adolescents with ADHD. Nine hundred ninety-two parents of children and adolescents with ADHD filled out an anonymous online survey through the ADHD family association website. The survey investigated the degree of severity of six emotional and mood states (sadness, boredom, little enjoyment/interest, irritability, temper tantrums, anxiety) and five disrupted behaviours (verbal and physical aggression, argument, opposition, restlessness) based on their frequency/week (absent; low: 1–2 days/week; moderate: 3–4 days/week; severe: 5–7 days/week) before and during the lockdown. Important fluctuations were found in all dimensions during the lockdown independently by the severity degree. Subjects with previous low severity degree of these behaviors significantly worsened in almost all dimensions during the lockdown. On the contrary, ADHD patients with moderate and severe degree showed important improvement during the lockdown. Little enjoyment/interests and boredom resulted the dimensions more strongly affected by the condition of restriction, overall in children. Children vs. adolescents showed substantially similar trend but the former resulted significantly more vulnerable to emotive changes. The results provided both the individuation of domains affected, and the indirect benefits produced by restriction condition.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113692,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113692,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113692,2021-02-01,,,

718,Short-term outpatient follow-up of COVID-19 patients: A multidisciplinary approach,"Background Short-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients reveals pulmonary dysfunction, myocardial damage and severe psychological distress. Little is known of the burden of these sequelae, and there are no clear recommendations for follow-up of COVID-19 patients. In this multi-disciplinary evaluation, cardiopulmonary function and psychological impairment after hospitalization for COVID-19 are mapped. Methods We evaluated patients at our outpatient clinic 6 weeks after discharge. Cardiopulmonary function was measured by echocardiography, 24-hours ECG monitoring and pulmonary function testing. Psychological adjustment was measured using questionnaires and semi-structured clinical interviews. A comparison was made between patients admitted to the general ward and Intensive care unit (ICU), and between patients with a high versus low functional status. Findings Eighty-one patients were included of whom 34 (41%) had been admitted to the ICU. New York Heart Association class II-III was present in 62% of the patients. Left ventricular function was normal in 78% of patients. ICU patients had a lower diffusion capacity (mean difference 12,5% P = 0.01), lower forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity (mean difference 14.9%; P<0.001; 15.4%; P<0.001; respectively). Risk of depression, anxiety and PTSD were 17%, 5% and 10% respectively and similar for both ICU and non-ICU patients. Interpretation Overall, most patients suffered from functional limitations. Dyspnea on exertion was most frequently reported, possibly related to decreased DLCOc. This could be caused by pulmonary fibrosis, which should be investigated in long-term follow-up. In addition, mechanical ventilation, deconditioning, or pulmonary embolism may play an important role.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100731,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100731,Scopus,10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100731,2021-02-01,,,

722,"Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic period on depression, anxiety and stress levels of the healthcare employees in Turkey","The COVID-19 pandemic has turned into a public health issue since December 2019 and has risen in all countries in the world. The healthcare employees taking part in the pandemic will eventually be affected by the process. The aim of the study is to determine the levels of the anxiety, depression, and stress of the healthcare employees during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. As the data collection tool, an e-survey was used. In the first section, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used. In the second section of the survey, the problems experienced by the healthcare employees during the pandemic and their working media were aimed to be defined. In the last section, the socio-demographic features of the employees were investigated. 2076 healthcare employees participated in the study. The results showed that the major cause of the anxiety or stress among healthcare employees comes from the fear to contaminate the COVID-19 virus to their families (86.9%). It was observed that the levels of depression, anxiety and stress of female employees are higher than that of male employees (p < 0.003). The highest depression, anxiety and stress levels of healthcare employees come from the pandemic, emergency, and internal services (p < 0.001). Health managers and policymakers need to make a move immediately to find solutions for the physical and psychological needs of the health employees. On the other hand, in order to minimize the risk, preparation of the work power plans beforehand and inclusion of obligatory referral chain into health services can be suggested.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.legalmed.2020.101811,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.legalmed.2020.101811,Scopus,10.1016/j.legalmed.2020.101811,2021-02-01,,,

We find 59 percent of students have both an internet connection at home and a computer or tablet, 74 percent are engaging in some online or telelearning, and 86 percent have done some schoolwork on the last weekday. Detailed time-use data show most students have established similar daily routines around education, although gender and wealth differences emerge in time spent working and on household tasks.

With this objective, this study applied a transversal, descriptive and analytical design in a sample of 1377 Spaniards during the confinement of COVID-19 from March 14 to June 20, 2020. The results report that music has been an essential generalized support for living with isolation and a powerful instrument for emotional self-regulation and relief from loneliness. Although an increase of 56% in the daily use of music for self-regulation of emotions was detected, higher frequencies of consumption, mainly in solitude, and a better conception of this artistic expression are identified in the population over 51 years old. However, young people between 18 and 40 years old stood out in the use of music as a resource to alleviate loneliness. These results confirm that music seems to have arisen as one of the most used artistic expressions to cope with loneliness, to relate to the outside or as a tool to endure psychological and emotional states catalogued as negative such as anxiety, anguish and depression, among others. Likewise, they evidence its role in personal and social wellbeing in distant age ranges, and the relational influence of music and age in contexts of isolation and loneliness.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06274,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06274,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06274,2021-02-01,,,
727,The burden of loneliness: Implications of the social determinants of health during COVID-19,"This study sought to examine if mental health issues, namely depression and anxiety symptoms, and loneliness were experienced differently according to various demographic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., a societal stressor). An online survey, comprising demographic questions and questionnaires on depression, anxiety and loneliness symptoms, was distributed in Canada during the height of social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents (N=661) from lower income households experienced greater anxiety, depression and loneliness. Specifically, loneliness was greater in those with an annual income <$50,000/yr versus higher income brackets. Younger females (18-29yr) displayed greater anxiety, depressive symptoms and loneliness than their male counterparts; this difference did not exist among the other age groups (30-64yr, >65yr). Moreover, loneliness scores increased with increasing depression and anxiety symptom severity category. The relationship between loneliness and depression symptoms was moderated by gender, such that females experienced higher depressive symptoms when encountering greater loneliness. These data identify younger females, individuals with lower income, and those living alone as experiencing greater loneliness and mental health challenges during the height of the pandemic in Canada. We highlight the strong relationship between loneliness, depression and anxiety, and emphasize increased vulnerability among certain cohorts.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113648,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113648,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113648,2021-02-01,,,

Short as well as long-term exposure to noise pollution has several adverse effects on humans, ranging from psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression, hypertension, hormonal dysfunction, and blood pressure rise leading to cardiovascular disease. One of the major sources of noise pollution is road traffic and the WHO reports that around 40 % of Europe’s population are currently exposed to high noise/sound levels. This study investigates sound levels in Dublin, Ireland before and after the lockdown imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis was performed using measured hourly data from 12 noise monitoring stations between January and May, 2020. More than 80 % of the stations recorded high sound levels for more that 60 % of the time before the lockdown in Dublin. However, a significant reduction in hourly average equivalent sound and hourly minimum sound levels was observed at all stations during the lockdown period and this can be attributed to reductions in both road and air traffic movements.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102597,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102597,Scopus,10.1016/j.scs.2020.102597,2021-02-01,,,
733,Smartphone Screen Time: Inaccuracy of self-reports and influence of psychological and contextual factors,"Previous research investigating associations between screen time and various undesirable consequences (e.g., poor mental health) has relied heavily on self-report measures. However, there is debate regarding whether self-reports overestimate or underestimate actual screen time. We used advances in iPhone software to address this question and to investigate the influence of individual difference factors, and COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, on screen time. Participants (N = 267, 18–25 years) completed scales measuring depression, anxiety, smartphone attachment, and estimated their screen time. Thereafter, they shared screenshots of their battery use (BUS) and iPhone screen time (iOS STT) data. Some (n = 24) shared their BUS data again during the COVID-19 lockdown. Whereas the BUS data (10-day average, including two weekends) indicated that self-reports underestimated actual use, the iOS STT data (7-day average) indicated that self-reports overestimated actual use (ps < .007). Smartphone use was heavier over weekends and screen time increased significantly during the lockdown (p = .001). Finally, smartphone attachment mediated the relationship between objective screen time and depression, but not anxiety. We conclude that iPhone tracking features can reliably collect objective screen time data, and that screen time is significantly influenced by both individual difference factors and environmental context.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106616,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106616,Scopus,10.1016/j.chb.2020.106616,2021-02-01,,,

788,6-month consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital: a cohort study,"Background The long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity. Methods We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5–6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences. Findings In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 57·0 (IQR 47·0–65·0) years and 897 (52%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 186·0 (175·0–199·0) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24% for those at severity scale 3, 22% for severity scale 4, and 29% for severity scale 5–6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22% for severity scale 3, 29% for scale 4, and 56% for scale 5–6, and median CT scores were 3·0 (IQR 2·0–5·0) for severity scale 3, 4·0 (3·0–5·0) for scale 4, and 5·0 (4·0–6·0) for scale 5–6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 1·61 (95% CI 0·80–3·25) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 4·60 (1·85–11·48) for scale 5–6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 0·88 (0·66–1·17) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 1·77 (1·05–2·97) for scale 5–6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 0·74 (0·58–0·96) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 2·69 (1·46–4·96) for scale 5–6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (96·2% vs 58·5%) and median titres (19·0 vs 10·0) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 1·73 m2 or more at acute phase had eGFR less than 90 mL/min per 1·73 m2 at follow-up. Interpretation At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.

789,"Self-reported changes in anxiety, depression and suicidality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","Introduction There are only a few published empirical data on COVID‐19′s effects on the mental health. Material and Methods During lockdown, an online questionnaire registered demographic, health data, previous psychiatric history, current anxiety, depression and suicidality, believing in conspiracy theories and other domains. Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02 ± 9.72 and 18.27% males; aged 36.38±10.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. Statistical Analysis A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. Results Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. Conclusions The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since most of these factors are modifiable. Future research, as well as interventions, should focus specifically on them.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.061,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.061,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.061,2021-01-15,,,

792,The COVID-19 pandemic and serious psychological consequences in Bangladesh: A population-based nationwide study,"Background As with other countries worldwide, lockdown measures during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh were sudden and unexpected, and have the capacity to elicit serious psychological consequences. The present study examined the psychological consequences of COVID-19 in Bangladesh during the lockdown period. Methods A nationwide online cross-sectional survey study recruited 10,067 individuals covering all 64 districts in Bangladesh via social media (April 1-10, 2020). The survey comprised questions concerning socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behavior towards COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation. Logistic regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were performed to identify the risk factors depression and suicidal ideation. Geographical information system (GIS)-based spatial analysis was used to identify district-wise susceptibility to depression and suicidal ideation. Findings The prevalence rate of depression and suicidal ideation related to COVID-19 was 33% and 5%%. Common risk factors for suicidal ideation and depression included being young, being female, being a cigarette smoker, having comorbid diseases, having high scores on the Fear COVID-19 Scale, and having insomnia symptoms. GIS-based maps detected high depression and suicidal ideation in the capital of Bangladesh and the districts near the capital as well as coastal areas where COVID-19 prevalence was high, as compared with districts with no reported cases. Limitations Self-reported scales and cross-sectional design of the study. Conclusion COVID-19 is associated with major psychological impact across Bangladesh, underlining the need of strategically located psychological support measures and improved access to mental health services, especially among women and younger people.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.036,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.036,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.036,2021-01-15,,,
793,"Modelling the contribution of the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress to generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","In the current study we sought to extend our understanding of vulnerability and protective factors (the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress) in predicting generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (n = 502), who were United States residents, completed a variety of sociodemographic questions and the following questionnaires: Big Five Inventory‐10 (BFI-10), Whitley Index 7 (WI-7), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C19-ASS), and Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness were negatively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms and that neuroticism, health anxiety and both measures of COVID-19 psychological distress were positively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. We used path analysis to determine the pattern of relationships specified by the theoretical model we proposed. Results showed that health anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome partially mediated the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were negatively associated with the three mediators, which, in turn, were positively associated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms, with COVID-19 anxiety showing the strongest effect. Conversely, neuroticism and openness were positively associated with COVID-19 anxiety and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, respectively. These relationships were independent of age, gender, employment status and risk status. The model accounted for a substantial variance of generalised anxiety and depression symptoms (R2 = .75). The implications of these findings are discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.053,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.053,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.053,2021-01-15,,,
794,Mental health and its correlates among children and adolescents during COVID-19 school closure: The importance of parent-child discussion,"Background School closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak have affected 87% of the world's students physically, socially, and psychologically, yet rigorous investigation into their mental health during this period is still lacking. Methods A cross-sectional online survey of 4-342 primary and secondary school students from Shanghai, China was conducted during March 13–23, 2020. Besides demographic information, psychological distress (including depression, anxiety, and stress), life satisfaction, perceived impact of home quarantine, and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were assessed. Results The three most prevalent symptoms were: anxiety (24.9%), depression (19.7%), and stress (15.2%). Participants were generally satisfied with life and 21.4% became more satisfied with life during school closures. Senior grades were positively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and negatively associated with life satisfaction, whereas the perceived benefit from home quarantine and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were negatively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and positively correlated with life satisfaction. Among participants who perceived no benefit from home quarantine, those who had discussions with their parents about COVID-19 experienced less depression, anxiety, and stress. Limitations Limitations included the inability to infer the casual relationship, no parental report for mental health of children aged 6 to 9, and the inadequate measurement of parent-child discussion. Conclusions Mental health problems and resilience co-existed in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the important role of parent-child discussions, open communication between parents and children about the pandemic should be encouraged to help children and adolescents cope with mental health problems in public health crisis.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.016,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.016,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.016,2021-01-15,,,
795,Neuropsychological and neurophysiological correlates of fatigue in post-acute patients with neurological manifestations of COVID-19: Insights into a challenging symptom,"More than half of patients who recover from COVID-19 experience fatigue. We studied fatigue using neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations in post-COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. Neuropsychological assessment included: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale, cognitive tests, and computerized tasks. Neurophysiological examination was assessed before (PRE) and 2 min after (POST) a 1-min fatiguing isometric pinching task and included: maximum compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) following ulnar nerve stimulation, resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and silent period (SP) duration in right FDI following transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex. Maximum pinch strength was measured. Perceived exertion was assessed with the Borg-Category-Ratio scale. Patients manifested fatigue, apathy, executive deficits, impaired cognitive control, and reduction in global cognition. Perceived exertion was higher in patients. CMAP and MEP were smaller in patients both PRE and POST. CMAP did not change in either group from PRE to POST, while MEP amplitudes declined in controls POST. SP duration did not differ between groups PRE, increased in controls but decreased in patients POST. Patients' change of SP duration from PRE to POST was negatively correlated to FSS. Abnormal SP shortening and lack of MEP depression concur with a reduction in post-exhaustion corticomotor inhibition, suggesting a possible GABAB-ergic dysfunction. This impairment might be related to the neuropsychological alterations. COVID-19-associated inflammation might lead to GABAergic impairment, possibly representing the basis of fatigue and explaining apathy and executive deficits.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117271,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117271,Scopus,10.1016/j.jns.2020.117271,2021-01-15,,,

Method This review was conducted based on papers that were published at MEDLINE, BMJ, PsycINFO, and LILACS, the according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA). Results Health professionals had a higher level of anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01, OR = 1.6152; 95%CI 1.3283 to 1.9641; p < 0.0001) and depression 12.2 vs. 9.5%; p = 0.04; OR = 1.3246; 95%CI 1.0930 to 1.6053; p = 0.0042), besides somatizations and insomnia compared to professionals from other areas.

814,"Psychiatric symptomatology associated with depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia in health professionals working in patients affected by COVID-19: A systematic review with meta-analysis","Background Health professionals are key personnel to containing infectious diseases like COVID-19. In the face of long work shifts (that reach 16 h per day on average), the risk of getting infected by a high-infectious disease and the lack of enough biological protection measures, mental suffering among health professionals suddenly became evident. Method We carried out an updated meta-analysis to investigate the psychiatric impacts on health professionals in the face of the physical and psychological conditions to which they are subjected due to the high demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Papers were researched in four databases from December 2019 to April 2020. In total, eight papers were included in the study. Results Health professionals working to fight COVID-19 are being more severely affected by psychiatric disorders associated with depression, anxiety, distress and insomnia, stress, and indirect traumatization than other occupational groups. No significant differences were observed in the publication bias. Conclusion There is a strong association between health professionals and COVID-19 in terms of psychiatric repercussions. Our meta-analysis showed that health professionals have a higher level of indirect traumatization, in which the level of damage exceeds psychological and emotional tolerance and indirectly results in psychological abnormalities. The incidence of obsessive-compulsive traces and somatizations was higher in situations involving front-line professionals.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057,Scopus,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057,2021-01-10,,,

853,Associations between periods of COVID-19 quarantine and mental health in Canada,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, including Canada, have made use of public health measures such as COVID-19 quarantine to reduce the transmission of the virus. To examine associations between these periods of quarantine and mental health, including suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm, we examined data from a national survey of 3000 Canadian adults distributed between May 14-29, 2020. Notably, participants provided the reason(s) for quarantine. When pooling all reasons for quarantine together, this experience was associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm in the two weeks preceding the survey. These associations remained even after controlling for age, household income, having a pre-existing mental health condition, being unemployed due to the pandemic, and living alone. However, the associations with mental health differed across reasons for quarantine; those who were self-isolating specifically due to recent travel were not found to have higher odds of suicidal ideation or deliberate self-harm. Our research suggests the importance of accounting for the reason(s) for quarantine in the implementation of this critical public health measure to reduce the mental health impacts of this experience.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113631,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113631,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113631,2021-01-01,,,

860,CCopeY: A Mixed-Methods Coproduced Study on the Mental Health Status and Coping Strategies of Young People During COVID-19 UK Lockdown,"Purpose Exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people’s mental health is an increasing priority. Studies to date are largely surveys and lack meaningful involvement from service users in their design, planning, and delivery. The study aimed to examine the mental health status and coping strategies of young people during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown using coproduction methodology. Methods The mental health status of young people (aged 16–24) in April 2020 was established utilizing a sequential explanatory coproduced mixed methods design. Factors associated with poor mental health status, including coping strategies, were also examined using an online survey and semi-structured interviews. Results Since the lockdown, 30.3% had poor mental health, and 10.8% had self-harmed. Young people identifying as Black/Black-British ethnicity had the highest increased odds of experiencing poor mental health (odds ratio [OR] 3.688, 95% CI .54–25.40). Behavioral disengagement (OR 1.462, 95% CI 1.22–1.76), self-blame (OR 1.307 95% CI 1.10–1.55), and substance use (OR 1.211 95% CI 1.02–1.44) coping strategies, negative affect (OR 1.109, 95% CI 1.07–1.15), sleep problems (OR .915 95% CI .88–.95) and conscientiousness personality trait (OR .819 95% CI .69–.98) were significantly associated with poor mental health. Three qualitative themes were identified: (1) pre-existing/developed helpful coping strategies employed, (2) mental health difficulties worsened, and (3) mental health and nonmental health support needed during and after lockdown. Conclusion Poor mental health is associated with dysfunctional coping strategies. Innovative coping strategies can help other young people cope during and after lockdowns, with digital and school promotion and application.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.01.009,2021-01-01,,,

864,The global burden of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review,"Purpose; The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated profound adaptations in the delivery of healthcare to manage a rise in critically unwell patients. In an attempt to slow the spread of the virus nationwide lockdown restrictions were introduced. This review aims to scope the literature on the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on the presentation and management of trauma globally. Methods; A scoping review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A systematic search was carried out on the Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases to identify papers investigating presentation and management of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. All studies based on patients admitted with orthopaedic trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Exclusion criteria were opinion-based reports, reviews, studies that did not provide quantitative data and papers not in English. Results; 665 studies were screened, with 57 meeting the eligibility criteria. Studies reported on the footfall of trauma in the UK, Europe, Asia, USA, Australia and New Zealand. A total of 29,591 patients during the pandemic were considered. Mean age was 43.7 years (range <1–103); 54.8% were male. Reported reductions in trauma footfall ranged from 20.3% to 84.6%, with a higher proportion of trauma occurring secondary to interpersonal violence, deliberate self-harm and falls from a height. A decrease was seen in road traffic collisions, sports injuries and trauma occurring outdoors. There was no significant change in the proportion of patients managed operatively, and the number of trauma patients reported to be COVID-19 positive was low. Conclusion; Whilst the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in the number of trauma patients; the services managing trauma have continued to function despite infrastructural, personnel and pathway changes in health systems. The substantial effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on elective orthopaedics is well described, however the contents of this review evidence minimal change in the delivery of effective trauma care despite resource constraints during this global COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.11.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.11.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcot.2020.11.005,2021-01-01,,,

867,Changes in pediatric trauma during COVID-19 stay-at-home epoch at a tertiary pediatric hospital,"Background Trauma is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. However, during the societal disruptions secondary to the coronavirus (COVID-19) stay-at-home regulations, there have been reported changes to the pattern and severity of pediatric trauma. We review our two-institution experience. Methods Pediatric trauma emergency department (ED) encounters from the National Trauma Registry for a large, tertiary, metropolitan level 1 pediatric trauma center and pediatric burn admission at the regional burn center were extracted for children less than 19 years from March 15th thru May 15th during the years 2015–2020. The primary outcome was the difference in encounters during the COVID-19 (2020) epoch versus the pre-COVID-19 epoch (2015–2019). Results There were 392 pediatric trauma encounters during the COVID-19 epoch as compared to 451, 475, 520, 460, 432 (mean 467.6) during the pre-COVID-19 epoch. Overall trauma admissions and ED trauma encounters were significantly lower (p < 0.001) during COVID-19. Burn injury admissions (p < 0.001) and penetrating trauma encounters (p = 0.002) increased during the COVID-19 epoch while blunt trauma encounters decreased (p < 0.001). Trauma occurred among more white (p = 0.01) and privately insured (p < 0.001) children, but no difference in suspected abuse, injury severity, mortality, age, or gender were detected. Sub-analysis showed significant decreases in motor vehicle crashes (p < 0.001), pedestrians struck by automobile (p < 0.001), all-terrain vehicle (ATV)/motorcross/bicycle/skateboard involved injuries (p = 0.02), falls (p < 0.001), and sports related injuries (p < 0.001). Fewer injuries occurring in the playground or home play equipment such as trampolines neared significance (p = 0.05). Interpersonal violence (assault, NAT, self-harm) was lower during the COVID-19 era (p = 0.04). For burn admissions, there was a significant increase in flame burns (p < 0.001). Conclusions Stay-at-home regulations alter societal patterns, leading to decreased overall and blunt traumas. However, the proportion of penetrating and burn injuries increased. Owing to increased stressors and time spent at home, healthcare professionals should keep a high suspicion for abuse and neglect.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2021.01.020,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2021.01.020,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2021.01.020,2021-01-01,,,

873,‘The dual pandemic’ of suicide and COVID-19: A biopsychosocial narrative of risks and prevention,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a new global health threat. By increasing the risk of isolation, fear, stigma, abuse and economic fallout, COVID-19 has led to increase in risk of psychiatric disorders, chronic trauma and stress, which eventually increase suicidality and suicidal behavior. There is limited data on association of pandemics and suicides. Cases of suicides have been rising since COVID-19 first emerged in China. The association between suicides and pandemics can possibly be explained through various models like Durkheim's theory, Joiner's interpersonal theory, social stress theory, biological theories, etc. The frontline workers, elderly, migrants, homeless, socio-economically impoverished classes as well as those with pre-existing mental disorders, substance abuse and family history of suicides are at higher risk. Suicides are preventable and need early detection, awareness and socio-culturally tailored interventions. This narrative review draws global perspectives on the association of suicidality and pandemics, the theories and risk factors related to same based on the available evidence. It also hypothesizes neuroimmunity and immune based risk factors as possible links between the psychosocial vulnerabilities and suicide during outbreaks like COVID-19. Proposed strategies of suicide-prevention, as an integral part of public health response to the pandemic are subsequently discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113577,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113577,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113577,2021-01-01,,,

The current study aims to examine the delivery of brief cognitive-behavioral therapy for suicide prevention (BCBT-SP) via Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT) to the home of a veteran discharged from the psychiatric inpatient unit after a recent suicide attempt. Preliminary data on acceptability, feasibility, and changes in symptoms were gathered. The veteran received treatment during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak and additional adaptations were made accordingly. The veteran did not engage in any suicidal behavior during the course of treatment, and suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety decreased as treatment progressed. The results provide initial support for the feasibility of BCBT-SP via CVT to the home.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2020.12.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2020.12.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.cbpra.2020.12.001,2021-01-01,,,

943,Perceived stress and sleep quality among the non-diseased general public in China during the 2019 coronavirus disease: a moderated mediation model,"Background The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and its associated stressors have resulted in decreased sleep quality among front-line workers. However, in China, the general public displayed more psychological problems than the front-line workers during the pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perceived stress on the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public and developed a moderated mediation model to explain said relationship. Methods Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted online from February 18–25, 2020 with 1630 Chinese participants (aged 18–68 years). Results Around one-third (36.38%) of participants were poor sleepers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels, which, in turn, was associated with lower sleep quality. Self-esteem moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through its moderation of the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. This indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety was stronger in those with low levels of self-esteem than in those with high levels of self-esteem. Conclusions These findings suggest that both the sleep quality and perceived stress levels of the non-diseased general public required attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identify personality characteristics related to better sleep quality, demonstrating the important role of self-esteem in environmental adaptation.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.021,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.021,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.021,2021-01-01,,,

960,Emotions and mood swings of pharmacy students in the context of the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic,"Introduction The coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic has changed university routines affecting student mental health. The aims of this study were to survey aspects related to mental health of pharmaceutical course students considering previous and current contexts. Methods The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brunel Mood Scale were used. DASS-21 was completed pre- and post-pandemic. The validity and reliability of the data were verified. The prevalence (95% CI) of mental health symptoms was estimated. The relationship between the time spent watching/reading the news and mean scales scores was evaluated (Pearson's correlation coefficient). Results The prevalence of depression symptoms in students pre-pandemic was 66.7% (95% CI = 65.3–68.1) and during the pandemic was 81% (95% CI = 79.8–82.2). More than 70% (95% CI = 69.8–72.6) of participants had some psychological impact as a result of the pandemic (mild: 16.7% [95% CI = 15.6–17.8]; moderate: 9.1% [95% CI = 8.2–10]; severe: 45.4% [95% CI = 43.9–46.9]). High values of tension, depressed mood, mental confusion, and anger were observed. There was a significant correlation between the time spent following the news of the pandemic and symptoms of anxiety (r = 0.356; P < .001), stress (r = 0.248; P = .014), hyperarousal (r = 0.322; P ≤ 0.001), and intrusion (r = 0.21; P = .039).

965,Psychological distress in the face of a pandemic: An observational study characterizing the impact of COVID-19 on immigrant outpatient mental health,"Undocumented immigrants have disproportionately suffered during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to factors including limited medical access and financial insecurity, which can exacerbate pandemic-associated distress. Psychological outcomes for immigrant outpatients were assessed after transition to telepsychiatry in March 2020. Mental health was assessed with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) inventories, a novel coronavirus-specific survey, and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10+). Feedback on telepsychiatry sessions and access to non-clinical resources were also gathered, after which multivariable linear regression modeling identified psychosocial factors underlying changes in distress levels. 48.57% and 45.71% of participants reported worsened anxiety and depression levels due to the pandemic, respectively. From March to April, PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores significantly increased by 0.81 and 0.63 points, respectively. The average total psychological distress score was 23.8, with 60% of scores reflecting serious mental illness. Factors that most influenced K10+ scores included a pre-existing depressive disorder, food insecurity, and comfort during telepsychiatry visits. 93.75% of participants believed access to remote psychiatry helped their mental health during COVID-19. The negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health in vulnerable populations stems from medical and psychosocial factors such as pre-existing psychiatric conditions and unmet essential needs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113595,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113595,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113595,2021-01-01,,,

968,The plausible mechanisms of tramadol for treatment of COVID-19,"Currently, no single medication has been approved for the management of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, drug repositioningby investigating the use of existing drugs for management of COVID-19 patients is considered a desperate need. Tramadol is a commonly prescribed analgesic drug for treatment of moderate to severe pain with less potential for dependence and respiratory depression. Multiple evidence support that tramadol is a promising drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Herein, we discuss the possible beneficial effects of using tramadol against SARS-CoV-2 infection and their underlying mechanism of action. The anti-inflammatory effect of tramadol may help to suppress the COVID-19 related cytokine storm through decreasing interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Besides, tramadol activates natural killer (NK) and T-cells and enhances IL-2 secretion, which produce immune-enhancing effect against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies confirmed that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure showed increased fibrin formation and polymerization that may lead to thrombosis. Tramadol owing to its hypocoagulable effect may protect against venous thromboembolism in these patients. Moreover, tramadol can exert a cardioprotective effect via decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level which is elevated in most of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have been correlated with old age patients, which may be due to the lack of antioxidant mechanisms and increased oxidative damage. Tramadol could protect COVID-19 patient from disease complications by increases the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase while diminished malondialdehyde. More interestingly, tramadol as an effective analgesic and antitussive may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19 patients suffering from cough, headache, ache, and pain. The tramadol anti-psychotic effect may also protect against psychiatric disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, tramadol has bactericidal activity against a wide range of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is common in severe COVID-19 patients leading to pneumonia with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesize that tramadol might be a promising adjuvant therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on that, tramadol should be considered as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 clinical trials.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110468,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110468,Scopus,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110468,2021-01-01,,,

971,How are bariatric patients coping during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic? Analysis of factors known to cause weight regain among postoperative bariatric patients,"Background The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is wreaking havoc on society. Bariatric patients are more prone to severe infection due to their high body mass index (BMI) and are more vulnerable to the effects of isolation, such as depression or disruption of their health habits. Objectives To quantify the impact of self-quarantine on bariatric patients and self-quarantine’s relationship with weight gain. Setting Academic hospital, United States. Methods A 30-item survey examining several known contributors to weight regain was distributed among the postoperative bariatric patients of our clinic. Changes in eating habits, exercise, depression, social support, loneliness, and anxiety were studied, among others. Results A total of 208 patients completed the survey (29.3% response rate). A large percentage of patients reported increases in their depression (44.2%), loneliness (36.2%), nervousness (54.7%), snacking (62.6%), loss of control when eating (48.2%), and binge eating (19.5%) and decreases in their social support (23.2%), healthy food eating (45.5%), and activity (55.2%). Difficulty in accessing vitamins was reported by 13%. Patients more than 18 months out of surgery regained more than 2 kg during an average of 47 days. Risk factors for weight regain were found to be loss of control when eating, increases in snacking and binge eating, reduced consumption of healthy food, and reduced physical activity. Conclusion Bariatric patients are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social isolation on many levels. This patient population is vulnerable to crisis situations; thus, additional intervention is needed to address behaviors that lead to weight regain.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2020.11.021,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2020.11.021,Scopus,10.1016/j.soard.2020.11.021,2021-01-01,,,

Methods This longitudinal study was based on a telephone follow-up survey of COVID-19 patients hospitalized and discharged from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China before 1 March 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported clinical sequelae of the survivors were described and analysed. A cohort of volunteers who were free of COVID-19 and lived in the urban area of Wuhan during the outbreak were also selected as the comparison group. Results Among 538 survivors (293, 54.5% female), the median (interquartile range) age was 52.0 (41.0–62.0) years, and the time from discharge from hospital to first follow-up was 97.0 (95.0–102.0) days. Clinical sequelae were common, including general symptoms (n = 267, 49.6%), respiratory symptoms (n = 210, 39%), cardiovascular-related symptoms (n = 70, 13%), psychosocial symptoms (n = 122, 22.7%) and alopecia (n = 154, 28.6%). We found that physical decline/fatigue (p < 0.01), postactivity polypnoea (p= 0.04) and alopecia (p < 0.01) were more common in female than in male subjects. Dyspnoea during hospitalization was associated with subsequent physical decline/fatigue, postactivity polypnoea and resting heart rate increases but not specifically with alopecia. A history of asthma during hospitalization was associated with subsequent postactivity polypnoea sequela. A history of pulse ≥90 bpm during hospitalization was associated with resting heart rate increase in convalescence. The duration of virus shedding after COVID-19 onset and hospital length of stay were longer in survivors with physical decline/fatigue or postactivity polypnoea than in those without. Conclusions Clinical sequelae during early COVID-19 convalescence were common; some of these sequelae might be related to gender, age and clinical characteristics during hospitalization.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.09.023,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.09.023,Scopus,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.09.023,2021-01-01,,,

We obtained suicide mortality data to assess completed suicides during the period of strict stay-at-home quarantine measures in Connecticut and compared this data with previous years. While the total age-adjusted suicide mortality rate decreased by 13% during the lockdown period compared with the 5-year average, a significantly higher proportion of suicide decedents were from racial minority groups.

1003,Obsessive-compulsive disorder during COVID-19: Turning a problem into an opportunity?,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted global measures to prevent infection. Experts assume that it is particularly affecting people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), especially those with washing compulsions. Data, however, are currently lacking. 394 participants with OCD (n = 223 washers) participated in an online survey. Change in severity of OCD symptoms, reasons participants reported for the change (e.g., reduced mobility, reduced availability of cleaning products, economic factors, interpersonal conflicts), as well as participants’ beliefs and experience associated with COVID-19 were assessed. 72 % of the participants reported an increase in OCD. This increase was significantly stronger in washers compared to non-washers. The worsening of symptoms was primarily associated with reduced mobility and interpersonal conflicts. Dysfunctional hygiene-related beliefs were significantly higher in washers than non-washers and were associated with greater symptom progression. Washers were more confident than non-washers about providing other people with helpful advice related to infection preventions. Washers, however, received more negative feedback from others in response to the advice they provided than non-washers. The majority of participants with OCD were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative effects were more pronounced in washers than in non-washers. Rapid interventions for OCD should be implemented to prevent long-term deterioration.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102329,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102329,Scopus,10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102329,2021-01-01,,,
1004,"Coronavirus 2019 Infectious Disease Epidemic: Where We Are, What Can Be Done and Hope For","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads mainly by means of aerosols (microdroplets) in enclosed environments, especially those in which temperature and humidity are regulated by means of air-conditioning. About 30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Among them, approximately 25% require hospitalization. In medicine, cases are identified as those who become ill. During this pandemic, cases have been identified as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, including approximately 70% who were asymptomatic—this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals more than 65 years old, those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, or are immune-depressed owing to cancer and other conditions, are at a higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 years very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality rate vary because the definition of COVID-19–related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death rate at 154.9 per 100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2. The United States includes all patients who died with a positive test, whether they died because of, or with, SARS-CoV-2. Countries that include only patients in which COVID-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a cofactor, have lower death rates. Numerous therapies are being developed, and rapid improvements are anticipated. Because of disinformation, only approximately 50% of the U.S. population plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. By sharing accurate information, physicians, health professionals, and scientists play a key role in addressing myths and anxiety, help public health officials enact measures to decrease infections, and provide the best care for those who become sick. In this article, we discuss these issues.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.12.014,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.12.014,Scopus,10.1016/j.jtho.2020.12.014,2021-01-01,,,
1005,"Examine the associations between perceived neighborhood conditions, physical activity, and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined how neighborhood conditions changed and how neighborhood conditions were associated with physical activity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans. The major outcomes were stratified by the neighborhood's poverty and regression models were used to assess the associations between neighborhood conditions and their change during the pandemic and the outcomes of physical activity and mental health. The results show that low-poverty neighborhoods had more health-promoting neighborhood conditions before the outbreak and more positive changes during the outbreak. Health-promoting neighborhood conditions were associated with higher physical activity and moderate physical activity and lack of negative neighborhood conditions such as crime/violence and traffic were associated with a lower risk of mental health problems including loneliness, depression, and anxiety. Mental health problems were also significantly associated with the COVID-19 infection and death and household income level. Our findings suggest that it is plausible that the disparities of physical activity and mental health by neighborhood exacerbate due to the pandemic and people who living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods bear increasingly disproportionate burden.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102505,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102505,Scopus,10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102505,2021-01-01,,,

The questionnaire included questions of KAP about COVID-19, depressive and anxiety symptoms scales. Multivariable generalized linear regressions models were applied to estimate the unstandardized regression coefficients (β) of KAP. The awareness rates about COVID-19 were 70.1%–99.5% for all 1650 valid questionnaires. 37.2% of the participants quite worried about being infected with COVID-19. Approximately 96% of them washed hands in certain situations, while 85.6% of them washed hands after coughing or sneezing. Compared to the students without depressive symptoms, those who had depressive symptoms scored lower of total KAP, knowledge, attitudes, and practice.

1010,"The first psychiatric pandemic: Encephalitis lethargica, 1917–27","Finding a link between COVID-19 and subsequent psychiatric symptoms has resulted in renewed interest in the psychiatric sequelae of pandemics. The first such instance was apparently the encephalitis lethargica pandemic which arose around the time of the First World War, moving in the shadow of a repiratory virus pandemic. The epidemic of encephalitis lethargica (EL), or Von Economo’s Disease, in the years 1917–27 was the first pandemic involving the central nervous system. It moved in some places in parallel with the Great Flu Pandemic but does not seem to have been caused by it. Unlike the coronavirus, pandemic EL affected children heavily, leading often to bizarre changes in character and personality. It often left sequelae lasting for decades in the form of postencephalitic Parkinsonism (PEP). Unlike the coronavirus, it had a high mortality of around 20 percent. Although encephalitis lethargica involved a number of systems, psychiatric morbidity was most prominent and entailed severe depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It ended without therapeutic or public-health measures; today, sporadic cases of EL continue to be reported. The hypothesis is that we can derive from the EL psychiatric pandemic certain lessons that might be useful in studying tardive COVID symptoms today.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110420,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110420,Scopus,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110420,2021-01-01,,,

Methods Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 age, sex, body mass index comorbidity-matched controls were enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments. Findings At 2–3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced breathlessness and 55% reported fatigue. On MRI, abnormalities were seen in lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%). Patients exhibited changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domains. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance were significantly reduced. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise intolerance correlated with serum markers of inflammation and acute illness severity. Patients had a higher burden of self-reported symptoms of depression and experienced significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls (p<0.0001 to 0.044). Interpretation A significant proportion of patients discharged from hospital reported symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, depression and had limited exercise capacity. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common in patients and linked to inflammation and severity of acute illness.

1022,Distress and risk perception in people living with multiple sclerosis during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background People living with MS during COVID-19 are experiencing the disruptions of the pandemic and concerns that their health status may place them at greater risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes. Objective This study sought to understand how people living with MS in the United States experienced distress and perceived their COVID-19-related risk during the first surge of the pandemic. Methods This was a web-based, self-report survey of people with MS who were living in the United States during the early stage of COVID-19. Primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and positive-affect and well-being. Participants (N = 491) also provided data on demographics, MS-related factors, COVID-19 factors, and psychological coping. Results Psychological distress was associated with age, psychological coping strategies, and having had symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but not with MS disease-related variables and COVID-19 risk factors. Perception of COVID-19-related risk was associated with age, MS disease severity, COVID-19-related factors, and anxiety. Conclusion This study demonstrated that even during COVID-19, distress and risk perception are primarily driven by psychological factors, experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and age, with minimal contribution from individual differences in health status, providing an impetus for continued efforts to optimize psychological interventions for people living with MS.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102618,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102618,Scopus,10.1016/j.msard.2020.102618,2021-01-01,,,

1034,"The association between depression symptoms, psychological burden caused by Covid-19 and physical activity: An investigation in Germany, Italy, Russia, and Spain","The outbreak of Covid-19 required the re-organization of everyday life. While some people accepted this challenge, other experienced the current situation as a heavy burden that impedes the adaptation to the new life conditions. The present study investigated factors that can impact the level of burden caused by Covid-19. Burden, depression symptoms and frequency of physical activity (e.g., jogging, cycling) were assessed via online surveys in overall 1,931 people from four countries (Germany: N = 625; Italy: N = 936; Russia: N = 230; Spain: N = 140). Similar result patterns were found in all country-specific samples. Burden by Covid-19 was significantly positively associated with depression symptoms, while it was significantly negatively linked to physical activity. Moreover, physical activity buffered the association between depression symptoms and burden. The present cross-national findings emphasize the protective effect of physical activity specifically in times of Covid-19. This issue should be addressed in governmental programs to longitudinally protect mental and physical health and to enhance the willingness to adhere to the anti-Covid-19 measures among the population.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113596,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113596,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113596,2021-01-01,,,

1037,Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Dental Care Providers on the Front Lines in China,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that emerged at the end of 2019. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a pandemic. To examine the psychological effects on dental care providers in China in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak and factors closely associated with those effects, we conducted a cross-sectional study online with 4 widely used self-administered questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the General Anxiety Disorder-7, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the variables that potentially affected the mental health of emergency dental care providers. As a result, 969 out of 1035 questionnaires were included in the analysis, with 642 respondents reporting more than 1 symptom (66.3%). The symptom of perceived stress was reported by the largest proportion of the respondents (66.2%, n = 641), and anxiety the least (7.1%, n = 69). After adjustment for confounders, it was found that dental practitioners with preexisting physical health conditions were at higher risk of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.972; 95% CI, 1.128-3.448; P = .017), and perceived stress (odds ratio, 2.397 95% CI, 1.283-4.478; P = .006). Additionally, feelings of fear, helplessness, or terror resulting from the possibility of contracting COVID-19 were significantly associated with the prevalence of all the 4 psychological symptoms observed (P < .05). In the present study, we found that dental care providers suffered psychological depression, stress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during COVID-19, which indicates the importance of psychological support at times of major epidemic outbreaks.

1042,Nexus planning as a pathway towards sustainable environmental and human health post Covid-19,"The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of linear and monocentric approaches in addressing today's complex, cross-cutting, and interconnected challenges. Experiences from the Covid-19 have shown that focusing on one sector during a crisis only aggravates the stresses in other sectors as decision-makers often view the world from a linear perspective, with the thought that a click of a button would get the economy and society back on track. This study argues that linearity forgets the interconnectedness of systems and how their systemic properties shape their interactions, interdependencies, and interrelationships, whereas nexus planning integrates and simplifies socio-ecological systems, indicates priority areas for intervention, and reduces risk and vulnerability. The lockdowns implemented during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in job losses, company closures, and economic recessions, demonstrating that linear approaches often over-emphasise on a limited set of attributes of a system, notably efficiency, at the expense of other aspects. While linear approaches have been beneficial to some extent for long, the Covid-19 pandemic exposed how they transfer stresses to other sectors, and compromise resilience-building initiatives, allowing failure to cascade from one sector to the other. Nexus planning emphasises on cross-sectoral sustainability and enhances socio-economic resilience against future shocks.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110376,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110376,Scopus,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110376,2021-01-01,,,

1044,Digital phenotyping and the COVID-19 pandemic: Capturing behavioral change in patients with psychiatric disorders,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented societal changes limiting us in our mobility and our ability to connect with others in person. These unusual but widespread changes provide a unique opportunity for studies using digital phenotyping tools. Digital phenotyping tools, such as mobile passive monitoring platforms (MPM), provide a new perspective on human behavior and hold promise to improve human behavioral research. However, there is currently little evidence that these tools can reliably detect changes in behavior. Considering the Considering the COVID-19 pandemic as a high impact common environmental factor we studied potential impact on behavior of participants using our mobile passive monitoring platform BEHAPP that was ambulatory tracking them during the COVID-19 pandemic. We pooled data from three MPM studies involving Schizophrenia (SZ), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) patients (N = 12). We compared the data collected on weekdays during three weeks prior and three weeks subsequent to the start of the quarantine. We hypothesized an increase in communication and a decrease in mobility. We observed a significant increase in the total time spent on communication applications (median 179 and 243 min per week respectively, p = 0.005), and a significant decrease in the number of unique places visited (median 6 and 3 visits per week respectively, p = 0.007), while the total time spent at home did not change significantly (median 64 and 77 h per week, respectively, p = 0.594).

1045,Psychiatric morbidity and protracted symptoms after COVID-19,"We investigated the psychiatric symptomatology and the protracted symptoms in patients who had recovered from the acute COVID-19 infection. Two hundred and eighty-four patients completed a web-based or a paper survey on socio-demographic and clinical data. The psychiatric status was assessed using Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of almost 50 days following the diagnosis, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s). Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, stigmatization, and a negative view on the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients are prone to substantial psychological distress in the first few months after the infection.

1046,Depression and sexual functions in epilepsy patients: Comparison before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major health problem with a high rate of spread. We aimed to investigate herein the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on depression and sexual dysfunction in patients with epilepsy. Material and Methods One hundred and sixteen epilepsy patients admitted to our hospital from October–November 2019 were evaluated for sexual functions and depression using the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) and Beck Depression Scale, respectively. These scales were re-applied in June 2020 and July 2020 to assess the impact of the outbreak on sexual function and depression in the same group of patients. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded and analyzed in SPSS. Results During the pandemic period, the total Beck Depression Scale values increased significantly in the patients with epilepsy compared to the pre-pandemic period (P =0.048), and depressive symptoms showed an increasing trend (P =0.032). Although an increase in sexual dysfunction was also recorded, it was not statistically significant compared to the pre-pandemic period. In eight patients (6.9%), seizure frequency increased during the pandemic period. In the multivariate analysis, the only parameter that predicted the increase in seizure frequency was the number of drugs used. The Beck Depression Scale values were positively correlated with total male/female ASEX values, age, marital status, duration of illness, and seizure frequency. Conclusion The COVID-19 outbreak caused an increase in the tendency to depression in epilepsy patients and has also had a negative effect on sexual function. During public health outbreaks, clinicians should focus not only on seizure control in patients with epilepsy but also on their mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.006,2021-01-01,,,

People with physical disabilities, who commonly encounter daily challenges such as barriers to community mobility, reduced access to healthcare services and higher risk of suffering from depression, may face additional challenges in the context of the pandemic. Objective This study aims to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, among people with physical disabilities. Methods A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on August 10, 2020 through a search in six online databases to synthesize results from original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with physical disabilities. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health was used to describe the population and the personal and environmental factors with a unified and standard health language. Results Eleven records were extracted from 1621 individual papers retrieved from the search strategy. Various impacts on daily functioning such as a decrease in access to healthcare have been noted during the pandemic. Changes in social and lifestyle habits, mood changes and decreased levels of physical activity were also noted. Conclusions Our results highlighted the lack of early research about the impacts of COVID-19 experienced by people with physical disabilities.

1051,Depression reported by US adults in 2017–2018 and March and April 2020,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated social distancing and lockdown restrictions are expected to have substantial and enduring mental health effects. In this study, we aimed to assess depression levels before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Methods We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) brief screening instrument to detect probable depression in two nationally representative surveys of US adults. Pre-pandemic levels of depression were assessed in a sample of 5,075 adults from the 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was assessed in March (N = 6,819) and April 2020 (N = 5,428) in the Understanding America Study, a representative sample of the US population. Results The percentage of US adults with depression increased significantly from 8.7% (95% CI[7.6%–9.8%]) in 2017–2018 to 10.6% (95% CI[9.6%–11.6%) in March 2020 and 14.4% (95% CI[13.1%–15.7%]) in April 2020. Statistically significant increases in depression levels were observed for all population subgroups examined with the exception of those aged 65+ years and Black participants. Young adults (aged 18–34) experienced a marked increase in depression of 13.4 percentage points (95% CI [9.5%–17.2%]) that was larger than any other age group. Additional analyses of depression trends in NHANES from 2007/2008–2017/2018 showed that the substantial increase in depression in April 2020 was unlikely to be due to typical year-to-year variation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that depression levels have risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforce recent findings indicating that young adults may be particularly vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.065,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.065,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.065,2021-01-01,,,
1052,"Cross-cultural comparisons of psychosocial distress in the USA, South Korea, France, and Hong Kong during the initial phase of COVID-19","The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in disruption of everyday life worldwide but the impact and response to the pandemic have not been uniform. Many countries rapidly deployed physical-distancing mandates to curb the spread of the virus; others did not. Social distancing strategies are necessary to reduce the transmission of the virus but there may be unintended consequences. We examined psychological distress in four societies with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental health outcome during the pandemic. From March to July of 2020, a survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and more severe loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome but the magnitudes of these effects varied across the four regions. Objective measures of social isolation did not affect mental health.

1054,Adding stress to the stressed: Senior high school students’ mental health amidst the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown in Greece,"The two-year preparation for the National university entrance exams in Greece is one of the most trying periods in a young person's life, physically and emotionally. The present study reports the results from 442 last year senior high school students who completed an online survey (16-30 April 2020) concerning the lockdown impact on their mental health. Overall, the rate of positive screen for depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 11) significantly increased from 48.5% to 63.8% and of those scoring within severe depression range (PHQ-9 ≥20) from 10% to 27%; for anxiety (GAD-7 score ≥ 11) increased from 23.8% to 49.5% and of those scoring within severe anxiety range (GAD-7≥17) from 3.8% to 20.5%. After taking sex and baseline (one month prior to the lockdown) levels of depression and anxiety into account, the level of lockdown experienced distress was predictive of depression and anxiety levels in time of home confinement, accounting for about 30% of variance in symptoms severity scores. Although our results may be subject to sampling and recall bias, the unexpectedly high rates of anxiety and depression warrant an urgent call to action aiming at mitigating and managing mental health risks of senior high school students in future waves of pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113560,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113560,Scopus,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113560,2021-01-01,,,

1058,"Prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and psychological distress among populations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Objective We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and Psychological distress (PD) related to COVID-19 among affected populations. Methods We searched articles in Medline, Embase, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. Random-effects meta-analyses on the proportions of individuals with symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and PD were generated and between-group differences for gender, healthcare workers (HCWs), and regions where studies were conducted. Results A total of 2189 articles were screened, 136 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Fifty-five peer-reviewed studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis (N=189,159). The prevalence of depression (k=46) was 15.97% (95%CI, 13.24-19.13). The prevalence of anxiety (k=54) was 15.15% (95%CI, 12.29-18.54). The prevalence of insomnia (k=14) was 23.87% (95%CI, 15.74-34.48). The prevalence of PTSD (k=13) was 21.94% (95%CI, 9.37-43.31). Finally, the prevalence of psychological distress (k=19) was 13.29% (95%CI, 8.80-19.57). Between-group differences were only found in HCWs (z=2.69, p < 0.05) who had a higher prevalence of insomnia than others.

1060,"Viral, host and environmental factors that favor anthropozoonotic spillover of coronaviruses: An opinionated review, focusing on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2","Environmental factors play a key role in the zoonotic transmission of emerging pathogenic viruses as mankind is constantly disturbing wildlife's ecosystems usually by cutting down forests to build human settlements or by catching wild animals for food, which deprives the viruses of their natural hosts and gives them opportunity to infect humans. In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged from bats and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Disease outbreaks such as SARS in 2002–2003, MERS in 2012 and the current COVID-19 pandemic are the result of higher mutation rates of coronaviruses and their unique capacity for genetic recombination, resulting in adaptations that make them more suitable to cross the species barriers and infect other species. This ability for host switching and interspecies infection is often attributed to the great diversity of these viruses, which is a result of viral and host factors such as the low fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the high frequency of their homologous RNA recombination, and the adaptation of the S protein to bind host receptors like the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in MERS-CoV. This review presents an overview of the zoonotic transmission of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, focusing on the viral, host and environmental factors that favor the spillover of these viruses into humans, as well as the biological and ecological factors that make bats the perfect animal reservoir of infection for these viruses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483,Scopus,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483,2021-01-01,,,

1063,Why public health framing matters: An experimental study of the effects of COVID-19 framing on prejudice and xenophobia in the United States,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a notable increase in the expression of prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes that threaten the wellbeing of minority groups and contribute to the overall public health toll of the virus. However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113572,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113572,Scopus,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113572,2021-01-01,,,
1064,COVID-19 and mental health in Brazil: Psychiatric symptoms in the general population,"Public health interventions at general population level are imperative in order to decrease the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but they may contribute to widespread emotional distress and increased risk for psychiatric illnesses. We report on the results of an investigation into the occurrence and determinants of psychiatric symptoms among the Brazilian general population (N = 1996). We assessed sociodemographic variables and general mental health (DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure), depression (PROMIS depression v.8a), anxiety (PROMIS anxiety v.8a), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale-IES-R scale) using an online web-based survey. Anxiety (81.9%), depression (68%), anger (64.5%), somatic symptoms (62.6%) and sleep problems (55.3%) were the most common psychiatric symptoms. Younger age, female gender, low income, lower level of education, longer period of social distancing, and self-reported history of previous psychiatric illness were strongly associated with higher severity of symptoms. Our results support the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the Brazilian population. The high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms observed in our sample indicates that the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered a public health problem in Brazil.

1072,Psychological defence mechanisms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case series,"Background and objectives COVID-19 has had a negative effect on mental health across the world's population. Healthcare workers in particular have experienced increased levels of psychological distress, depression and anxiety. Any perceived stress to an individual can provoke psychological defence mechanisms. Using psychoanalytic theory, a defence mechanism is described as an unconscious psychological strategy, with or without resulting behaviour, which aims to reduce or eliminate anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful stimuli. This paper aims to describe a range of psychological defence mechanisms encountered within colleagues in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using the methodology of a case series, specific defence mechanisms are explored with reference to further literature in the field. Results The author has encountered varying psychological defence mechanisms, both within himself and in other members of the multidisciplinary team. These have been illustrated in the attached clinical vignettes, relating to the specific psychological coping mechanisms of; denial, hypochondriasis, altruism, sublimation and humour. Conclusion We encourage acknowledgement of psychological defence mechanisms and their implications on day to day practice. Whilst defence mechanisms can have a number of negative consequences as described in this article, they also have an important role, particularly in the case of mature defence mechanisms, as protective factors against psychological distress and symptom formation. Deeper understanding of the gold-standard hierarchical organisation of defence mechanisms could help increase utilisation of specific therapeutic interventions for enhancing changes from immature to mature defensive responses to stressful experiences as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2020.10.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2020.10.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejpsy.2020.10.005,2021-01-01,,,
1073,The assessment of lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic using a multidimensional scale,"Introduction Healthy lifestyles are relevant to several diseases and to maintain individuals’ mental health. Exposure to epidemics and confinement have been consistently associated with psychological consequences, but changes on lifestyle behaviours remain under-researched. Materials and Methods An online survey was conducted among the general population living in Spain during the COVID-19 home-isolation. In addition to demographic and clinical data, participants self-reported changes in seven lifestyle domains. The Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation was developed specifically to evaluate changes during the confinement (SMILE-C). Results A total of 1254 individuals completed the survey over the first week of data collection. The internal consistency of the SMILE-C to assess lifestyles during confinement was shown (Cronbach's Alpha=0.747). Most participants reported substantial changes on outdoor time (93.6%) and physical activity (70.2%). Moreover, about one third of subjects reported significant changes on stress management, social support, and restorative sleep. Several demographic and clinical factors were associated to lifestyle scores. In the multivariate model, those independently associated with a healthier lifestyle included substantial changes on stress management (p <0.001), social support (p =0.001) and outdoor time (p <0.001), amongst others. In contrast, being an essential worker (p =0.001), worse self-rated health (p <0.001), a positive screening for depression/anxiety (p <0.001), and substantial changes on diet/nutrition (p <0.001) and sleep (p <0.001) were all associated with poorer lifestyles. Conclusions In this study, sizable proportions of participants reported meaningful changes in lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. Moreover, the SMILE-C was sensitive to detect these changes and presented good initial psychometric properties. Further follow-up studies should collect relevant data to promote healthy lifestyles in pandemic times.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.07.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.07.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.07.003,2021-01-01,,,
1074,The electrocardiographic manifestations and derangements of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),"Electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in patients admitted with COVID-19 and a decision tree to predict their survival were assessed. 145 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 infection were selected. Patient demographics, ECG variables, peak troponins, use of standard medications, and clinical outcomes were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and a predictive model of survival was developed using classification tree analysis. Of the 145 admitted patients, 38 (26%) died. Deceased patients were more likely to have a significantly higher incidence of poor R-Wave progression [6 of 37 (16.2%) Vs. 0 of 104 (0%), p < 0.001] as well as prolonged QTc values [24 of 37 (64.9%) Vs. 38 of 99 (38.4%), p 0.006]. Significant ST segment depressions were found in 5 of 37 (13.5%) of the deceased category compared to 0% in the non-deceased (p < 0.01). Right and/or left atrial enlargement was more prevalent in the deceased cohort [7 of 37 (18.9%) Vs. 4 of 104 (3.8%), p = 0.03]. Bundle branch blocks were more prevalent in the deceased group [9 of 35 (25.8%) Vs. 7 of 104 (6.7%), p 0.002]. Peak troponins were significantly higher in the deceased group (1.0 Vs 0.07 ng/ml, p < 0.001) A prediction tree built utilizing age, PACs, troponins and QTc had an accuracy of 85.5%. 65 of 74 patients (87.8%) were correctly predicted to survive, while 23 of 29 (79.3%) were correctly predicted to become deceased.

Of the respondents (n=733), a considerable proportion had moderate to severe anxiety (21.2%) and depression (15%). Stress symptoms, above the cut-off point of 3 in PC-PTSD-5 suggestive of probable PTSD, were present in 34.1%. Mental health problems were significantly associated with students, 20 to 30 year olds, those who are single, and university educated. Considerable proportions of healthcare workers presented with stress symptoms (21.4%), anxiety (5.6%) and depression (5.6%), however, the proportions were significantly less in comparison with others. Various coping strategies were reported; respondents who avoided thinking about the pandemic or seemed unsure of coping strategies and those struggling to cope had significantly greater anxiety and depression.

1076,Psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on LGBT people in Chile,"Introduction COVID-19 pandemic has led many countries around the world, including Chile, to take various measures, including physical and, social isolation. The effects of these measures, necessary to prevent the virus from spreading, must be studied. In particular, quarantines are known to have an impact on quality of life and well-being (for example, associated symptoms such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and other psychosocial consequences). Furthermore, these effects are expected to be more pronounced in previously disadvantaged populations, such as LGBT people. This paper describes the main measures taken by LGBT population during quarantine to avoid COVID-19 and its psychosocial consequences on an individual and social basis. Method Non-probability sampling was used. An online self-administered survey including 1181 participants was used. These were lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender residents over 18 years old from Chile. Results Almost eight out of ten participants were in a total quarantine situation. From them, 18.2% were in partial isolation and only 4.6% were not in quarantine. COVID-19 has affected almost all the LGBT participants to a certain extent. COVID-19 has emotionally affected the vast majority of the LGBT participants to a certain extent. In other words, the pandemic has affected their lives. This psychosocial impact of COVID has been greater for people who define themselves as *sexual (include queer, asexual, pansexual, demisexual). Discussion The measures taken to prevent the virus transmission significantly affect LGBT people's life.

Our research aimed to investigate the relationship between perceived stress and emotional distress during the initial outbreak. Furthermore, potential risks and protective factors, i.e., coping and boredom proneness, of stress-related emotional distress were also explored. Data from 3233 participants in China were collected through an online survey platform during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 from January 31 to February 9 in 2020. Results showed that higher perceived stress was associated with more emotional distress including depression, fear, compulsion-anxiety, neurasthenia, and hypochondria. Boredom proneness significantly and positively mediated the relationship between perceived stress and emotional distress. Moreover, coping style moderated the stress-emotional distress relationship, i.e., individuals who mainly adopted positive coping strategies suffered fewer symptoms of depression, compulsion-anxiety, and neurasthenia under stress, while negative coping strategies aggravated emotional distress.

The overarching lesson seems that when government policy is well coordinated and underpinned by a science-driven and fundamentally pragmatic approach, morbidity and mortality can be reduced. Within this, the importance of strategic clarity and delivery, housing, lowered thresholds to methadone provision, Benzodiazepine (BZD) provision and Naloxone availability were key determinants of policy success. Further, this paper argues that the rapid collapse in policy barriers to these interventions that COVID-19 produced should be secured and protected while further research is conducted.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102966,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102966,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102966,2021-01-01,,,

1087,Impact of outbreak COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatry emergencies in Spain,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused an unprecedented clinical situation. A retrospective cross-sectional study was designed with the aim to evaluate psychiatric emergencies from March 14 to May 1, 2020, coinciding with the start of the emergency state and the lockdown until the attenuation of the confinement. Data obtained during this period were compared with the emergencies attended in the same period of 2019. A total of 213 psychiatric emergencies were attended in 2020 compared with 367 in 2019. The mean number of emergencies per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (M=4.35, SD= 2.04) vs. the same period in 2019 (M=7.50, SD= 3.18). A higher percentage of patients with schizo/psychotic disorders (34.3% in 2020, vs. 24.3% in 2019), as well as a lower percentage of patients with anxiety/adaptive disorders (25.4% in 2020 vs. 35.4% in 2019) was observed during the outbreak. A significant lower mean discharge/emergency ratio (M=42.17, SD= 26.94 in 2020 vs. M=63.43, SD= 17.64 in 2019) and a higher referral to Internal Medicine/emergency ratio (M=20.55, SD= 22.16 in 2020 vs. M=3.32, SD= 6.63 in 2019) was observed.

1089,Threat perceptions and the intention to acquire firearms,"Firearm sales have surged during COVID-19, raising concerns about a coming wave of suicide deaths. Little is known, however, about the individuals considering acquiring firearms during the pandemic. Recent research has highlighted that individuals considering acquiring firearms may be motivated by exaggerated threat expectancies. In a sample of 3,500 Americans matched to 2010 United States Census data, we compared individuals intending to buy firearms in the coming 12 months (assessed in late June and early July 2020) to those undecided or not planning to acquire firearms on a range of demographic, anxiety, and firearm ownership variables. Our results indicated that those intending to acquire a firearm in the next twelve months are less tolerant of uncertainty, endorse exaggerated threat expectancies, and are experiencing more severe COVID-19 specific fears. Individuals intending to purchase firearms were also more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation in the past year, to have worked in law enforcement, and to have been considered essential workers during COVID-19. Furthermore, such individuals were more likely to already own firearms and to have purchased firearms during the opening months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those intending to purchase firearms did not endorse lower perceived neighborhood safety, however, indicating that their intent to purchase firearms is unlikely to be driven by tangible threats in their immediate environment. These findings highlight that exaggerated fears may be motivating individuals to purchase firearms to diminish anxiety and that this trend may be particularly common among individuals who already own firearms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.033,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.033,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.033,2021-01-01,,,
1090,"Risk factors for depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms in perinatal women during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background Pregnant women and women who recently gave birth are vulnerable to COVID-19-related psychosocial stresses. Methods We assessed COVID-19-related health worries and grief, and current mental health symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD) in 1,123 U.S. women during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 21 to August 17, 2020) through a cross-sectional study design. Results Among our respondents, 36.4% reported clinically significant levels of depression, 22.7% for generalized anxiety, and 10.3% for PTSD. Women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses based on their self-reported history were 1.6-to-3.7 more likely to score at clinically significant levels of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. Approximately 18% reported high levels of COVID-19-related health worries and were 2.6-to-4.2 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. Approximately 9% reported high levels of grief and were 4.8-to-5.5 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for mental health symptoms. Conclusions Perinatal women with pre-existing mental health diagnoses show elevated symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although causation cannot be inferred, COVID-19-related health worries and grief experiences may increase the likelihood of mental health symptoms among those without pre-existing mental health concerns.

We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological status, self-management behaviors, and diabetes care maintenance among Saudi adults with T1DM using insulin pump therapy. Methods This cross-sectional study used a web survey to collect data on Saudi adults with T1DM who were treated in the specialized insulin pump clinic at King Abdulaziz Medical City-Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7 scales to measure depression and anxiety. Results Of the 70 patients who received the survey, 65 completed it. Overall, 23.1% and 29.2% of the patients reported moderate to severe and mild depression, respectively; 18.5% and 24.6% reported moderate to severe and mild anxiety, respectively. Compared with pre-lockdown, adherence to a healthy diet and regular physical activity decreased in 67.7% and 41.5% of the patients, respectively. Most patients maintained their adherence to insulin pump behaviors; frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose increased in 47% of glucometer users. Most patients benefited from phone visits or virtual education sessions, but 66.2% of the patients reported difficulty obtaining at least one type of insulin pump supply. Conclusions Promoting self-management behaviors and psychological wellbeing of patients with T1DM using insulin pump therapy is crucial during a lockdown. Telemedicine is a useful alternative to in-person appointments, but strategies to ensure that patients have access to adequate resources during lockdown must be developed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.12.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.12.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.12.013,2021-01-01,,,

1101,Psychological distress assessment among patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19: A cohort study,"Background Global pandemic resulted from the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) demands mental health concerns on the affected population. We examine the time-course shift of psychological burden among suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods Participants with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included in the cohort. Consecutive surveys were conducted upon hospital admission, discharge, and during outpatient follow-up by adapting the 5-item brief symptom rating scale (BSRS-5) assessing psychological symptoms including anxiety, depression, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, and insomnia. The sixth measure to observe suicidal ideation was also included. Results A total of 109 eligible patients participated in the study, in which 83.49% reported no distress upon hospital admission, while 2.75%, 3.66%, and 10.1% patients were assessed as being with severe, moderate and mild psychological distress, respectively. Overall, age, sex, and history of contact did not significantly differ between patients with and without psychological distress. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that patients admitted during April–May (OR: 7.66, 95% CI: 1.46–40.28) and presented with symptoms including sore throat (OR: 4.24, 95% CI: 1.17–15.29) and malaise (OR: 5.24, 95% CI: 1.21–22.77) showed significantly higher risk of psychological distress. Cough symptom interestingly showed lower risk of emotional distress (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.08–0.81). Subsequent surveys upon hospital discharge and during outpatient follow-up revealed steadily declining distress among all cohort. Conclusion At least 16.5% of our cohort reported psychological distress upon hospital admission, with distinct time-dependent decline.

1104,The influence of 2020 coronavirus lockdown on presentation of oral and maxillofacial trauma to a central London hospital,"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 was first identified in China in December 2019. Its spread resulted in a pandemic, with the United Kingdom entering a period of national lockdown on 23 March 2020 to reduce disease burden on the National Health Service (NHS). King’s College Hospital is a Major Trauma Centre serving an inner-city population of 700,000 with 120,000 patients attending the emergency department (ED) annually. We aimed to determine the effect of lockdown on OMFS trauma presentations and lessons learned from emergency service provision during a pandemic. All referrals to the oral and maxillofacial surgical (OMFS) team from ED during the first six weeks of the lockdown period – 23 March 2020 - 3 May 2020 – were compared with the same six-week period in 2019. A total of 111 referrals were made to OMFS during the first six weeks of the lockdown period in 2020 compared with 380 referrals in 2019. Of these, 50.5%, (n=192) were related to facial trauma in 2019 vs (63.1%, n=70) in 2020. Fewer patients were admitted under OMFS: 17.4% (n=35) in 2019 vs 2.9% (n=2) in 2020, and a greater number of patients were discharged from OMFS care directly from the ED: 63.2% (n=127) in 2019 vs 82.9% (n=58) in 2020. There was profound effect of the lockdown on referrals to OMFS from the ED, in number and type of diagnosis. This is potentially reflective of the increased availability of acute/emergency dental services in South-East London during the lockdown period. This gives us valuable insight for service planning in the event of further restrictions.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.08.065,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.08.065,Scopus,10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.08.065,2021-01-01,,,

1106,Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.,"South Korea was able to successfully control the spread of COVID-19 without nationwide lockdowns or drastic social distancing efforts, but pandemic-related psychological outcome of the general population remains unknown. Between March and June 2020, 400 South Korean residents participated in an online study of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis-risk and loneliness, as well as indices of social network, physical health and demographics. Clinical levels of depression, anxiety or stress were reported by 45% of the respondents, and psychosis-risk was present in 12.8%; a drastic increase above the base rate reported by previous studies conducted in South Korea prior to the pandemic. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea.

1110,The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown on Caregivers of People With Dementia,"Background Caregivers of people with dementia (pwD) are at risk of depression, anxiety, and burden. COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed lockdown as a preventive measure might increase psychological symptoms in caregivers. The authors performed a study to measure the change of psychological symptoms during quarantine or self-isolation for COVID-19 in a sample of Italian caregivers of pwD, and to investigate if the resilience is associated with psychological changes in the sample. Methods Eighty-four caregivers of pwD completed an online survey including questionnaires assessing depressive symptomatology and anxiety before and during the lockdown, caregiver burden and levels of resilience. Results The multivariate analysis of variance revealed an effect of time (before and during the lockdown) in the whole group on depression scores; a significant interaction between time and resilience was found on anxiety scores, revealing that caregivers with high resilience showed a more significant increase of anxiety levels during lockdown than caregivers with low resilience. Moreover, the regression analysis revealed that caregiver burden was associated negatively with resilience scores, and positively with higher functional dependence. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown produced psychological consequences in caregivers of pwD, with an increase of levels of depression. Moreover, high resilience had a negative effect on anxiety levels and no effect on depressive symptomatology during the lockdown; moreover, it was associated with lower levels of caregiver burden. All caregivers, even those with high resilience levels, should be addressed to psychological interventions to reduce levels of depression, anxiety and caregiver burden.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.009,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.009,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.009,2021-01-01,,,

The impact it has had has overwhelmed the entire healthcare system, from the unknown carrier status, poor testing capabilities to hospitals running out of ventilators for severely ill patients. There has been a variety of potential treatment modalities for the various forms of illness ranging from asymptomatic carriers to the ventilated ICU patients. These include anti-inflammatory medications, antibiotics, immune-modulators, convalescent plasma, and others. The cytokine storm that inflicts some patients can be devastating to the vital organs of the human body in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, coagulopathy, and death. Cytosorbents® cytokine filter is a potential treatment methodology aimed at reducing the cytokine storm, thus serving as a bridge for therapy in the acutely ill patients infected with COVID-19.

1121,Providing addiction services during a pandemic: Lessons learned from COVID-19,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures have made in-person mutual help groups inaccessible to many individuals struggling with substance use disorders (SUDs). Prior to the pandemic, stakeholders in our community had sponsored a program to train volunteers to facilitate local Self-Management and Recovery Training (SMART Recovery) groups. As a result, the community established seven weekly SMART Recovery groups, which more than 200 community members attended. In March 2020, the community discontinued these groups due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To provide SMART Recovery during social distancing, we developed a one-on-one phone-in service for people with SUDs and addictions: the SMART Recovery Line (SMARTline). In this paper, we share our experience training volunteers to facilitate SMART Recovery groups and SMARTline. As a result of our experience, we have learned to: (1) establish plans in advance to migrate services from face-to-face settings to remote platforms; (2) consider remote platforms that are easily accessible to the greatest number of individuals; (3) include as many stakeholders in the planning process as possible; (4) consider recruiting volunteers to help in the provision of services, especially since many people want to help fellow community members during crises; and (5) anticipate and prepare for crises well before they occur.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108156,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108156,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108156,2021-01-01,,,
1122,The provision of counseling to patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder: Telehealth innovations and challenges in the age of COVID-19,"Historically, federal and state policies have narrowly defined treatment models that have resulted in limited access to and engagement in counseling for individuals receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD; e.g., methadone and buprenorphine). In response to the coronavirus pandemic, outpatient MOUD treatment providers rapidly transitioned from traditional, in-person care delivery models to revised COVID-19 protocols that prioritized telehealth counseling to protect the health of patients and staff and ensure continuity in MOUD care. These telehealth innovations appear to mitigate many of the longstanding barriers to counseling in the traditional system and have the potential to forever alter MOUD care delivery. Drawing on data from a Rhode Island–based clinic, we argue that MOUD counseling is achievable via telehealth and outline the need for, and anticipated benefits of, hybrid telehealth/in-person MOUD treatment models moving forward.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108163,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108163,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108163,2021-01-01,,,

1126,Factors Associated With Psychiatric Adverse Effects in Healthcare Personnel During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ecuador,"Introducción Desde la aparición de la enfermedad por el nuevo coronavirus de 2019 (COVID-19), el mundo se enfrentó a una pandemia con consecuencias a todo nivel. En muchos países los sistemas de salud se han visto colapsados y el personal de salud ha tenido que enfrentarse a esta crisis en primera línea. Los efectos adversos sobre la salud mental del personal sanitario han sido ampliamente reportados. La presente investigación se enfoca en identificar los principales factores asociados con efectos adversos psicológicos. Métodos Estudio descriptivo, transversal, basado en encuestas, aplicando los test PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI y EIE-R a personal de salud de Ecuador durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Resultados Participaron 1.028 personas, distribuidas en: 557 médicos (54,18%), 349 enfermeras (33,94%), 29 laboratoristas (2,82%), 27 paramédicos (2,62%), 52 psicólogos (5,05%) y 14 terapeutas respiratorios (1,36%), de 16 de las 24 provincias de Ecuador. El 27,3% tenía síntomas de depresión; el 39,2%, síntomas de ansiedad; el 16,3%, insomnio y el 43,8%, síntomas de TEPT; los 4 tipos de síntomas iban de moderados a graves. Los factores asociados más relevantes fueron: trabajar en Guayas (la provincia más afectada) (OR = 2,18 para síntomas depresivos y OR = 2,59 para síntomas de TEPT); ser médico posgradista (OR = 1,52 para síntomas depresivos y OR = 1,57 para insomnio), percepción de no contar con el equipo de protección adecuado (OR = 1,71 para síntomas de depresión y OR = 1,57 para síntomas de ansiedad) y ser mujer (OR = 1,39 para ansiedad). Conclusiones El personal de salud puede tener una afección mental importante que puede requerir intervención médica psiquiátrica y psicológica. Los principales factores asociados se relacionan sobre todo con vivir y trabajar en ciudades con mayor número de casos y las características del trabajo, como ser médico posgradista, así como la percepción propia de seguridad. Se requiere realizar más estudios según evolucione la pandemia. Introduction Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the world has faced a pandemic with consequences at all levels. In many countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Methods Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results 1,028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression, 39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4 types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety). Conclusions Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are required as the pandemic evolves.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.12.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.12.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.rcp.2020.12.007,2021-01-01,,,
1127,"Real-time suicide mortality data from police reports in Queensland, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic: an interrupted time-series analysis","Background Deaths by suicide can increase during infectious disease outbreaks. This study analysed suspected suicide rates in 2020 relative to 2015–19 to assess any early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland, Australia. Methods We analysed data from the interim Queensland Suicide Register (iQSR), a state-wide real-time suicide surveillance system, using an interrupted time-series design. The data source for the iQSR is the Form 1 police report of a death to a coroner. Two QSR staff independently classed the probability of a death by suicide as possible, probable, or beyond reasonable doubt. The analysis included the probable or beyond reasonable doubt categories as suspected suicides. The primary outcome was the monthly suspected suicide rate. We applied Poisson and negative binomial regressions to assess whether Queensland's Public Health Emergency Declaration on Jan 29, 2020, affected suspected suicides from Feb 1 to Aug 31, 2020. Secondary outcomes included absolute or relative changes in police-reported motives of recent unemployment, financial problems, domestic violence, and relationship breakdown. Findings 3793 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14·85 deaths per 100 000 people (from Jan 1, 2015, to Jan 31, 2020) before the declaration, and 443 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14·07 deaths per 100 000 people (Feb 1, 2020, onwards) after the declaration. An interrupted time-series Poisson regression model unadjusted (rate ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% CI 0·82–1·06) and adjusted for overdispersion, seasonality, and pre-exposure trends (RR 1·02, 95% CI 0·83–1·25) indicated no evidence of a change in suspected suicide rates. We found no absolute or relative increases in the motives for suspected suicides, including recent unemployment, financial problems, relationship breakdown, or domestic violence from February to August, 2020, compared with the pre-exposure period. Interpretation There does not yet appear to be an overall change in the suspected suicide rate in the 7 months since Queensland declared a public health emergency. Despite this, COVID-19 has contributed to some suspected suicides in Queensland. Ongoing community spread and increasing death rates of COVID-19, and its impact on national economies and mental health, reinforces the need for governments to maintain the monitoring and reporting of suicide mortality in real time.

1136,"Prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during COVID-19 pandemic","Background The COVID-19 pandemic is putting healthcare workers across the world in an unprecedented situation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the potential factors associated with them. Materials and methods A self-designed online questionnaire survey, which consisted of the demographic and selected features, the occupational protection knowledge, attitudes, and practices of COVID-19, and the Chinese version of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, were used to assess the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during COVID-19 pandemic. The logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the potential factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results A total of 617 pediatric nurses were included in the survey. A considerable proportion of pediatric nurses reported symptoms of depression (95 [15.4%]), anxiety (201 [32.6%]), and stress (111 [18.0%]). Results of multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that the good occupational protection practices (for depression: OR = 0.455, 95%CI: 0.281 to 0.739; for anxiety: OR = 0.597, 95%CI: 0.419 to 0.851; for stress: OR = 0.269, 95%CI: 0.166 to 0.438) and the personal protective equipment (PPE) meeting work requirements (for depression: OR = 0.438, 95%CI: 0.246 to 0.778; for anxiety: OR = 0.581, 95%CI: 0.352 to 0.959; for stress: OR = 0.504, 95%CI: 0.283 to 0.898) were independent protective factors against depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Yet, working in an isolation ward or fever clinic was an independent risk factor associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively (for depression: OR = 1.809, 95%CI: 1.103 to 2.966; for anxiety: OR = 1.864, 95%CI: 1.221 to 2.846; for stress: OR = 2.974, 95%CI: 1.866 to 4.741). Having suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the departments (OR = 1.554, 95%CI: 1.053 to 2.294) and coming in contact with the patient's bodily fluids or blood (OR = 1.469, 95%CI: 1.031 to 2.095) were independent risk factors for anxiety, while >3 times of training for COVID-19 related information was an independent protective factor for depression (OR = 0.592, 95%CI: 0.360 to 0.974). Moreover, >10 years of working was an independent risk factor for stress (OR = 1.678, 95%CI: 1.075 to 2.618). Conclusion During the COVID-19 outbreak, a considerable proportion of Hubei pediatric nurses had psychological problems. The pediatric nurses endorsing the higher number of risk factors should be given special attention and necessary psychological intervention. Improving the levels of PPE so as to meet the work requirements and intensifying occupational protection practices might help safeguard pediatric nurses from depression, anxiety, and stress.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152217,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152217,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152217,2021-01-01,,,
1137,Management of Chronic Pain in Nursing Homes: Navigating Challenges to Improve Person-Centered Care,"Despite the dynamic demands in the nursing home (NH), a definitive approach to managing chronic pain in older adults has yet to be established. Due to concerns for potential adverse pharmacologic effects, balancing appropriate pain management is a challenge among NH residents. The challenges encompass but are not limited to medical complexities, functional disabilities, and physical frailty. Barriers to the successful implementation of a comprehensive chronic pain management at the NH may include ambiguous directions on specific therapeutic interventions, insufficient guidance on treatment duration, and limited available treatment options. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ reporting requirement of adequate pain control among NH residents coupled with widely variable clinician-prescribing habits highlights the difficulties in overcoming the preceding challenges and barriers. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further complicated pain management due to its negative consequences on well-being of residents of NHs. Associated symptoms of psychosocial stress, anxiety and depression, and chronic pain symptoms can exacerbate during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased requirement for pain medications including but not limited to opioids. Pain is a multidimensional symptom and requires a strategic multimodal approach for its management. Nonpharmacologic modalities are underutilized in the NH setting and are the preferred first steps for mild pain, and nonopioid pharmacological agents can be added as a second step for a synergistic effect for moderate to severe pain. Opioids should be used as a last resort. Short-acting opioids are preferred over extended-release/long-acting opioids for chronic pain. Clinicians are encouraged to engage residents in proactive strategies in managing their pain, and to set realistic expectations toward improving their quality of life, as complete elimination of pain is not feasible in most cases. This review article provides the interdisciplinary team with a contemporary perspective of the multitude of changes and challenges influencing the prescribing as well as deprescribing of various pain medications.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.12.029,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.12.029,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamda.2020.12.029,2021-01-01,,,

1140,Anxiety and depression symptoms of medical staff under COVID-19 epidemic in China,"Background It is well known that unexpected pandemic has led to an increase in mental health problems among a variety of populations. Methods In this study, an online non-probability sample survey was used to anonymously investigate the anxiety and depression symptoms among medical staff under the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaire included Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms were estimated by logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 1090 medical staff were investigated in this study. The estimated self-reported rates of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms and both of the two were 13.3%, 18.4% and 23.9% respectively. Factors associated with self-reported anxiety symptoms include married status (OR=2.3, 95%CI: 1.2, 4.4), not living alone (OR=0.4, 95%CI: 0.2, 0.7), never confiding their troubles to others (OR=2.2, 95%CI: 1.4, 3.5) and higher stress (OR=14.4, 95%CI: 7.8, 26.4). Factors associated with self-reported depression symptoms include not living alone (OR=0.4, 95%CI: 0.3, 0.7), sometimes/often getting care from neighbours (OR=0.6, 95%CI: 0.4, 0.9), never confiding their troubles to others (OR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.0) and higher stress (OR=9.7, 95%CI: 6.2, 15.2). Limitations The study was a non-probability sample survey. Besides, scales used in this study can only identify mental health states. Conclusions Under outbreak of COVID-19, self-reported rates of anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms were high in investigated medical staff.

1141,The immediate impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on subjective sleep status,"Background An outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been ongoing in China since January 2020. The threat of infection affects the work and life of most of the population and may also damage sleep. This study aims to examine the subjective sleep status and mental health of the population during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. Method The data were collected through an online questionnaire with a sample of 5461 individuals in China from February 5, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Participants were divided into four groups based on their degree of threat from COVID-19: Group 1 was most closely associated with COVID-19, including inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, first-line hospital workers and first-line management staff; Group 2 included outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients who developed a fever and visited the hospital; Group 3 included people related to Group 1 or 2, such as their colleagues, relatives, friends and rescuers; and Group 4 was the farthest removed from contact with COVID-19, covering the general public affected by COVID-19 prevention strategies. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were used. Results Threat degree of COVID-19 (groups) had significant correlations with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Age, gender, and area (Hubei province or other provinces) had significant correlations with insomnia (p < 0.01). A total of 1380 (24.46%) participants were suspected of having major depression based on the PHQ-9. Additionally, 1042 (18.47%) participants were suspected of having generalized anxiety disorder based on the GAD-7. A total of 892 (15.8%) of the participants had Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) according to the ASDS. The prevalence of clinical insomnia during the outbreak was 20.05% (1131) according to the ISI. The factors of satisfaction with the current sleep pattern and how perceptible the symptoms of the current sleep pattern are to other people (p < 0.05) and the middle (difficulty staying asleep) and terminal (waking up too early) (p < 0.01) factors of the ISI were significantly different across groups. A total of 1129 (20.01%) participants spent more than one hour awake in bed. Conclusion The results indicated that insomnia is more severe in people who are female, young, living in the epicenter and experiencing a high degree of threat from COVID-19.

The purpose of our article is to demonstrate how the interRAI LTC facility (LTCF) assessment can inform clinical care and evaluate the effect of strategies to mitigate worsening mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a supporting analysis of the effects of lockdown in homes without COVID-19 outbreaks on depression, delirium, and behavior problems in a network of 7 LTC homes in New Brunswick, Canada, where mitigative strategies were deployed to minimize poor mental health outcomes (eg, virtual visits and increased student volunteers). This network meets regularly to review performance on risk-adjusted quality of care indicators from the interRAI LTCF and share learning through a community of practice model. We included 4209 assessments from 765 LTC residents between January 2017 to June 2020 and modeled the change within and between residents for depression, delirium, and behavioral problems over time with longitudinal generalized estimating equations. Though the number of residents who had in-person visits with family decreased from 73.2% before to 17.9% during lockdown (chi square, P < .001), the number of residents experiencing delirium (4.5%-3.5%, P = .51) and behavioral problems (35.5%-30.2%, P = .19) did not change. The proportion of residents with indications of depression decreased from 19.9% before to 11.5% during lockdown (P < .002). The final multivariate models indicate that the effect of lockdown was not statistically significant on depression, delirium, or behavioral problems. Our analyses demonstrate that poor mental health outcomes associated with lockdown can be mitigated with thoughtful intervention and ongoing evaluation with clinical information systems. Policy makers can use outputs to guide resource deployment, and researchers can examine the data to identify better management strategies for when pandemic strikes again.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.10.028,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.10.028,Scopus,10.1016/j.jamda.2020.10.028,2021-01-01,,,
1145,Mental health and sleep disturbances in physically active adults during the COVID-19 lockdown in Norway: does change in physical activity level matter?,"Study objective To assess mental health and sleep disturbances among physically active adults during the Norwegian lockdown caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to investigate if change in physical activity (PA) level during the lockdown moderates the association between mental health and sleep disturbances. Methods Members of a Norwegian fitness association were invited to fill out an online questionnaire including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), sleep disturbances and change in PA habits (decreased, unchanged, increased) during the COVID-19 lockdown from 12 March to 15 June 2020. Results A sample of 1281 members aged 19–81 years were included (31% females; mean ± SD age 49 ± 11.5). Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was 9.0% and 4.4%, respectively. During the lockdown period, 13.8% reduced, 21.9% increased and 64.3% did not change PA level. In total 21.9% reported sleeping disturbances. Anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were statistically significantly associated with sleep disturbances. Change in PA did not influence the association between mental health and sleep. Conclusion Compared to studies from the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were substantial lower in this Norwegian sample of relatively physically active adults. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with sleep disturbances, but change in PA level during the COVID-19 lockdown did not influence the association between mental health and sleep disturbances.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.030,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.030,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.030,2021-01-01,,,

1147,Health-related factors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among non-health workers in Spain,"Background Non-health workers engaged in essential activities during the pandemic are less researched on the effects of COVID-19 than health workers. Objective to study the differences between those who work away from home and those who do so from home, when the effects of fear of contagion cross with those of confinement, about the psychological distress during the COVID-19 in Spain. Design Observational descriptive cross-sectional study. Data sources The study was carried out receiving 1089 questionnaires from non-health workers that were working away from home and doing so from their homes. The questionnaire included sociodemographic and occupational data, physical symptoms, self-perceived health, use of preventive measures and possible contacts, and the Goldberg GHQ-12. Results 71.6% of non-health female workers and 52.4% of non-health male workers had psychological distress, with differences among those working away from home and those working from home. The level of psychological distress among non-health workers is predicted by 66.5% through the variables: being a woman, 43 years old or younger, having a home with no outdoor spaces, poor perception of health, number of symptoms, and having been in contact with contaminated people or material. Among workers who work away from home, being self-employed is another predictive variable of distress. Conclusion More than the half of the sample showed inadequate management of the psychological distress. There are modifiable factors which provide necessary elements to support a positive attitude of the workers, such as: knowledge of hygiene, transmission of the virus, protective measures, and social distancing measures.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104996,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104996,Scopus,10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104996,2021-01-01,,,

1150,"Depressed, anxious, and stressed: What have healthcare workers on the frontlines in Egypt and Saudi Arabia experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Introduction As the Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) was declared by the world health organization a pandemic in March 2020, thousands of healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide were on the frontlines fighting against the pandemic. Herein, we selected two Middle East countries; Egypt and Saudi Arabia to investigate the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their HCWs. Methods In this cross-sectional study, a Google survey was used to access HCWs in many hospitals in Egypt and Saudi Arabia between the 14th and 24th of April 2020. The survey assessed HCWs regarding their sociodemographic and occupational features, sleeping hours, and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results This study included 426 HCWs (48.4% physicians, 24.2% nurses, and 27.4% other HCWs). Of them, 69% had depression, 58.9% had anxiety, 55.9% had stress, and 37.3% had inadequate sleeping (<6 h/day). Female sex, age ≤30 years, working in Egypt, attending emergency and night shifts, watching/reading COVID-19 news ≥2 h/day, and not getting emotional support from family, society, and hospital were associated with a high likelihood of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping. Limitations the cross-sectional design restricted our ability to distinguish between preexisting and emerging psychological symptoms. Conclusion HCWs on the frontlines in Egypt and Saudi Arabia experienced depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.080,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.080,Scopus,10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.080,2021-01-01,,,

1156,Correlates of insomnia among the adults during COVID19 pandemic: evidence from an online survey in India,"Background Psychosocial distresses are often associated with sleep disorders. This is found as a common population level observation during natural calamities or emergency situations like a pandemic. The current study was conducted to determine the magnitude of self-reported insomnia, and to identify its associated factors among the apparently healthy Indian adult population having access to social media during the lockdown period of COVID 19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional, region-stratified survey was conducted from April 20 – May 19, 2020 in India using online questionnaire comprising Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, variables related to concern, fear and apprehension about COVID19 pandemic, and different socio-clinical variables. The questionnaire was disseminated via different social media platforms and responses from 1081 respondents were included in the analysis. Results Moderate clinical insomnia was present in 13.32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.23%–14.50%), and severe clinical insomnia was present in 1.85% (95% CI: 1.08%–3.14%). For higher levels of insomnia mild anxiety was associated with a proportional odds ratio (OR) of 1.83 (95% CI: 1.24–2.71), and moderate and severe anxiety had an OR of 4.01 (95% CI: 2.57–6.25). Factors associated with higher severity of insomnia were middle age group (36–50 years), being a professional, living alone, perceiving COVID as serious disease, urban residence and those having comorbidity. The OR for being concerned for staying indoors was 5.09 (95% CI: 4.09–5.33), whereas the OR for fear of scarcity in availability of masks and sanitizers was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.26–1.75); and the OR for fear of unavailability of essential goods was 3.20 (95% CI: 2.06–4.98). Conclusions Psychosocial factors like generalized anxiety, higher age, higher perceived severity, and various concerns related to COVID19 pandemic were identified to be associated with higher degrees of insomnia. Necessary psychosocial interventions, may be required to address the burden of insomnia in a timely and long-term mode.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.11.020,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.11.020,Scopus,10.1016/j.sleep.2020.11.020,2021-01-01,,,
1157,The impact of SARS-CoV2 on the anxiety levels of subjects and on the anxiety and depression levels of their parents,"Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV2 outbreak was announced a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th, 2020. Both the pandemic itself and the restrictions were thought to create some psychological problems especially in patients with chronic illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic on daily lives of children with MS, and the anxiety status of these patients and anxiety - depression status of their parents. Methods This study was performed on a group of pediatric MS patients aged 8–18 years in Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, and Child Neurology Department. Thirty patients with MS and their 30 parents were enrolled to the study. The control group consisted of 49 healthy, age- and sex-matched children and their 49 parents. The patients (and their parents) were asked to complete a web-based survey evaluating access to health care and other changes in daily life between March 11th, 2020 and June 1st, 2020. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [which is composed of two parts; S-anxiety (STAI-S) and T-anxiety (STAI-T)] was administrated to the patients and healthy controls and the results were compared between the two groups to assess their anxiety levels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) [which is composed of two parts; HAD-anxiety (HAD-A) and HAD-depression (HAD-D)] was also given to all parents. The results of the HAD tests were compared between the two groups statistically. Results The results of the web-based survey showed that 4 of 9 (44.4%) patients, who had a regular workout program, left the program and 13 (43.3%) patients put on weight during the pandemic. Twenty-two patients (73.3%) could not get direct exposure to sunlight because of the curfew. Therefore, approximately half of the patients started to take vitamin D supplement. Most of the patients (80%) thought that they had higher risk and believed that they would have severe symptoms compared to healthy people. Twenty one (70%) patients disrupted their regular health checks and the most frequent causes were identified as closure of policlinics to routine patient care (33%) and concerns of getting SARS-CoV2 infection (26,6%). Two of 3 patients who had an MS attack did not go to the doctor during this period. The mean STAI-S scores in MS patients were significantly higher compared to the healthy controls (p=<0.001). The level of S-anxiety in all patients was higher compared to the cut off value.The mean HAD A score was found to be significantly higher in them compared to the parents of healthy individuals (p = 0.001). Conclusion Our results showed that children with MS had negative changes in daily life and high anxiety levels during the pandemic. Since MS patients have also psychiatric comorbidities, they may need psychosocial support especially in this period. Besides, establishment of separate health centers to be used during pandemics for children with chronic illnesses such as MS may be recommended to facilitate access to health care.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102595,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102595,Scopus,10.1016/j.msard.2020.102595,2021-01-01,,,

1166,Clinically distinct COVID-19 cases share notably similar immune response progression: A follow-up analysis,"Inflammatory responses to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, range from asymptomatic to severe. Here we present a follow-up analysis of a longitudinal study characterizing COVID-19 immune responses from a father and son with distinctly different clinical courses. The father required a lengthy hospital stay for severe symptoms, whereas his son had mild symptoms and no fever yet tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 29 days. Father and son, as well as another unrelated COVID-19 patient, displayed a robust increase of SERPING1, the transcript encoding C1 esterase inhibitor (C1–INH). We further bolstered this finding by incorporating a serum proteomics dataset and found that serum C1–INH was consistently increased in COVID-19 patients. C1–INH is a central regulator of the contact and complement systems, potentially linking COVID-19 to complement hyperactivation, fibrin clot formation, and immune depression. Furthermore, despite distinct clinical cases, significant parallels were observed in transcripts involved in interferon and B cell signaling. As symptoms were resolving, widespread decreases were seen in immune-related transcripts to levels below those of healthy controls. Our study provides insight into the immune responses of likely millions of people with extremely mild symptoms who may not be aware of their infection with SARS-CoV-2 and implies a potential for long-lasting consequences that could contribute to reinfection risk.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05877,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05877,Scopus,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05877,2021-01-01,,,

To answer them, natural variability in policy implementation across US states and over time was analyzed to determine if mitigation policies correlated with Google searches for terms associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Findings indicated that restaurant/bar limits and stay-at-home orders correlated with immediate increases in searches for isolation and worry but the effects tapered off two to four weeks after their respective peaks. Moreover, the policies correlated with a reduction in searches for antidepressants and suicide, thus revealing no evidence of increases in severe symptomatology. The policy implications of these findings are discussed.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2020.100963,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2020.100963,Scopus,10.1016/j.ehb.2020.100963,2021-01-01,,,

1208,"Benefits of Sexual Activity on Psychological, Relational, and Sexual Health During the COVID-19 Breakout","Background The COVID-19–related lockdown has profoundly changed human behaviors and habits, impairing general and psychological well-being. Along with psychosocial consequences, it is possible that sexual behavior was also affected. Aims With the present study, we evaluated the impact of the community-wide containment and consequent social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health through standardized psychometric tools. Methods A case-control study was performed through a web-based survey and comparing subjects of both genders with (group A, N = 2,608) and without (group B, N = 4,213) sexual activity during lockdown. The Welch and chi-square tests were used to assess differences between groups. Univariate analysis of covariance, logistic regression models, and structural equation modeling were performed to measure influence and mediation effects of sexual activity on psychological, relational, and sexual outcomes. Outcomes Main outcome measures were General Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Dyadic Adjustment Scale for quality of relationship and a set of well-validated sexological inventories (International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, and male-female versions of the Orgasmometer). Results Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in subjects sexually active during lockdown. Analysis of covariance identified gender, sexual activity, and living without partner during lockdown as significantly affecting anxiety and depression scores (P < .0001). Logistic regression models showed that lack of sexual activity during lockdown was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing anxiety and depression (OR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.12 - 1.57, P < .001] and 1.34 [95% CI: 1.15 - 1.57, P < .0001], respectively). Structural equation modeling evidenced the protective role of sexual activity toward psychological distress (βmales = -0.18 and βfemales = -0.14), relational health (βmales = 0.26 and βfemales = 0.29) and sexual health, both directly (βmales = 0.43 and βfemales = 0.31), and indirectly (βmales = 0.13 and βfemales = 0.13). Clinical translation The demonstrated mutual influence of sexual health on psychological and relational health could direct the clinical community toward a reinterpretation of the relationship among these factors. Strengths and limitations Based on a large number of subjects and well-validated psychometric tools, this study elucidated the protective role of sexual activity for psychological distress, as well for relational and sexual health. Main limitations were the web-based characteristics of the protocol and the retrospective nature of prelockdown data on psychorelational and sexual health of subjects recruited. Conclusions COVID-19 lockdown dramatically impacted on psychological, relational, and sexual health of the population. In this scenario, sexual activity played a protective effect, in both genders, on the quarantine-related plague of anxiety and mood disorders. Mollaioli D, Sansone A, Ciocca G, et al.

1210,Understanding the genetic contribution of the human leukocyte antigen system to common major psychiatric disorders in a world pandemic context,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a complex genetic system that encodes proteins which predominantly regulate immune/inflammatory processes. It can be involved in a variety of immuno-inflammatory disorders ranging from infections to autoimmunity and cancers. The HLA system is also suggested to be involved in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity, especially through microglia regulation and synaptic pruning. Consequently, this highly polymorphic gene region has recently emerged as a major player in the etiology of several major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder and with less evidence for major depressive disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We thus review here the role of HLA genes in particular subgroups of psychiatric disorders and foresee their potential implication in future research. In particular, given the prominent role that the HLA system plays in the regulation of viral infection, this review is particularly timely in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.033,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.033,Scopus,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.033,2021-01-01,,,

1212,The Protective Roles of Exercise and Maintenance of Daily Living Routines for Chinese Adolescents During the COVID-19 Quarantine Period,"Purpose Adolescents are particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 quarantine periods and may be at risk for developing psychological distress symptoms that extend beyond a crisis, including depression. This study examined adolescents’ postquarantine depressive symptoms associated with pandemic stressors. The primary aim was to identify potential protective factors that may buffer the association between the presence of COVID-19 cases in adolescents’ communities and their postquarantine depressive symptoms. Methods Adolescents from public schools were recruited from Zhengzhou city, Henan, China (N = 1,487, M age=13.14 years, 50% girls). Adolescents reported the presence of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in their communities, their daily activities and routines during the 2-month quarantine period, and depressive symptoms after the quarantine period. Results The presence of cases in adolescents’ communities during the quarantine contributed to more depressive symptoms in adolescents after the quarantine. This association was buffered by adolescents’ spending more time on physical activities and better maintenance of daily living routines during the quarantine period. The presence of community infection was also more strongly associated with depressive symptoms in older adolescents. Conclusions The presence of COVID-19 cases in communities contributed to adolescents’ poorer mental health, and the association was stronger for older adolescents. Spending time on physical activities and maintaining daily living routines during the quarantine appear to be practical strategies that can be used by adolescents to mitigate the association between pandemic stressors and their diminishing mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.026,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.026,Scopus,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.026,2021-01-01,,,

1220,Changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement due to COVID-19 and depressive symptomatology: A cross-sectional a population-based study,"Background The measures adopted to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries included mobility and social restrictions that produced an immediate impact on the lifestyle of their inhabitants. Methods We assessed the association between the consequences of these measures and depressive symptomatology using a population-based sample of 692 individuals aged 18 or over from an ongoing study in the province of Girona (Catalonia, Spain). Participants responded to a telephone-based survey that included questions related to the consequences of confinement and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to identify which changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement were independently associated with a possible depression episode and depressive symptomatology. Results The prevalence of a possible depressive episode during the confinement was 12.7% (95% CI = 10.3–15.4). An adverse work situation, expected economic distress, self-reported worsening of the mental health and of the dietary pattern, and worries about a relative's potential infection were variables related to an increased risk of having a possible depressive episode. The changes in lifestyle accounted for 32% of the variance of the PHQ-9 score. Conclusion The findings indicate an association of the job situation, the expected negative economic consequences, the perceived worsening of health and habits, and the worries about COVID-19 infection with depressive symptomatology during the confinement.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152214,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152214,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152214,2021-01-01,,,

1227,Traditional Chinese herbal medicine at the forefront battle against COVID-19: Clinical experience and scientific basis,"Background Throughout the 5000-year history of China, more than 300 epidemics were recorded. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCM) has been used effectively to combat each of these epidemics’ infections, and saved many lives. To date, there are hundreds of herbal TCM formulae developed for the purpose of prevention and treatment during epidemic infections. When COVID-19 ravaged the Wuhan district in China in early January 2020, without a deep understanding about the nature of COVID-19, patients admitted to the TCM Hospital in Wuhan were immediately treated with TCM and reported later with >90% efficacy. Approach We conducted conduct a systematic survey of various TCM herbal preparations used in Wuhan and to review their efficacy, according to the published clinical data; and, secondly, to find the most popular herbs used in these preparations and look into the opportunity of future research in the isolation and identification of bioactive natural products for fighting COVID-19. Results Although bioactive natural products in these herbal preparations may have direct antiviral activities, TCM employed for fighting epidemic infections was primarily based on the TCM theory of restoring the balance of the human immune system, thereby defeating the viral infection indirectly. In addition, certain TCM teachings relevant to the meridian system deserve better attention. For instance, many TCM herbal preparations target the lung meridian, which connects the lung and large intestine. This interconnection between the lung, including the upper respiratory system, and the intestine, may explain why certain TCM formulae showed excellent relief of lung congestion and diarrhea, two characteristics of COVID-19 infection. Conclusion There is good reason for us to learn from ancient wisdom and accumulated clinical experience, in combination with cutting edge science and technologies, to fight with the devastating COVID-19 pandemic now and emerging new coronaviruses in the future.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153337,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153337,Scopus,10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153337,2021-01-01,,,
1228,"Phenotyping mental health: Age, community size, and depression differently modulate COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety","Introduction When the first COVID-19 infections were reported in Germany, fear and anxiety spread faster than the pandemic itself. While moderate amounts of fear of a COVID-19 infection may be functional, generalized anxiety and the potentially resulting distress and psychopathology may possibly be detrimental to people's health. Authorities need to avoid a countrywide panic, on the one hand, but foster a realistic awareness of the actual threat, on the other hand. Objectives The current cross-sectional study aimed to investigate psychological reactions in response to the real or perceived infection threats. In particular, the analysis should reveal whether COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety in times of COVID-19 have distinct correlates. Methods A nationwide study was conducted from March 10th to May 4th 2020 in Germany (n = 15,308; 10,824 women, 4433 men, 51 other). Generalized anxiety was assessed using the GAD-7, while COVID-19-related fear was measured using a self-generated item. Both outcome variables were entered into linear regression models. Demographic information, depressive symptoms, trust in governmental interventions, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 and media use were used to predict generalized anxiety and COVID-19-related fear. Results The data revealed distinct correlates of COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety. Although COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety had overlapping predictors, such as neuroticism, they most prominently differed in age distribution and direction of an urban-rural disparity: generalized anxiety decreases with age, but COVID-19-related fear is most pronounced in elderly participants. Generalized anxiety is also more prevalent in rural communities, but COVID-19-related fear is elevated in metropoles. Furthermore, the presence of a risk disease increases COVID-19-related fear, but not generalized anxiety. Conclusion These results suggest that COVID-19-related fear is often justified considering the individual risk of infection or complication due to infection. Some of the characteristics that predict COVID-19-related fear leave generalized anxiety unaffected or show divergent predictive directions. The present findings hint toward two related, but discriminant constructs.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152218,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152218,Scopus,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152218,2021-01-01,,,

1234,Sharp increase in depression and anxiety among Brazilian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the PAMPA cohort,"Objectives We aimed to compare the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms before and during the pandemic and identify factors associated with aggravated mental health symptoms. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods We identified the proportion of normal, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety before and during the social distancing restrictions in adults from southern Brazil. An online, self-administered questionnaire was delivered for residents within the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were examined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results Most of the participants (n = 2314) aged between 31 and 59 years (54.2%), were women (76.6%), White (90.6%) with a university degree (66.6%). Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were reported in 3.9% and 4.5% of participants, respectively, before COVID-19. During the pandemic (June–July, 2020), these proportions increased to 29.1% (6.6-fold increase) and 37.8% (7.4-fold increase), respectively. Higher rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms were observed among women, those aged 18–30 years, diagnosed with chronic disease and participants who had their income negatively affected by social restrictions. Remaining active or becoming physically active during social distancing restrictions reduced the probability of aggravated mental health disorders. Conclusions Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a 6.6- and 7.4-fold increase since the COVID-19 pandemic. Public policies such as physical activity promotion and strategies to reduce the economic strain caused by this pandemic are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on mental health.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.013,2021-01-01,,,

The standard theory of its anthelmintic and insecticidal mode of action is that it is a selective positive allosteric modulator of glutamate-gated chloride channels found in nematodes and insects. At higher concentrations, ivermectin also acts as an allosteric modulator of ion channels found in host central nervous systems. In addition, in tissue culture, at concentrations higher than anthelmintic concentrations, ivermectin shows antiviral, antimalarial, antimetabolic, and anticancer effects. Caution is required before extrapolating from these preliminary repositioning experiments to clinical use, particularly for Covid-19 treatment, because of the high concentrations of ivermectin used in tissue-culture experiments.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2020.10.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2020.10.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.pt.2020.10.005,2021-01-01,,,

1246,Telemedicine and the rural dementia population: A systematic review,"Background Telemedicine is a timely solution for the restrictions that COVID-19 social distancing places upon conventional modalities of healthcare provision. Geriatric populations affected by dementia require greater access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. As such, the aim of this systematic review is to examine the impact of telemedicine on health outcomes in elderly individuals with dementia living in rural areas. Methods A systematic review was completed using Ovid Medline, Web of Science and ACM Digital Libraries. The keywords for the selection of articles were: (telemedicine OR Telehealth) AND (Rural) AND (Age* OR Eld*) AND (Dementia) and (Telemedicine) AND (Rural Health OR Rural Population OR Hospitals, Rural OR Rural Health Services) AND (Aged OR Aging) AND (Dementia OR Multi-Infarct Dementia OR Vascular Dementia OR Frontotemporal Dementia). Among the 94 articles identified, 79 (84.0 %) were screened, 58 (61.7 %) were assessed and 12 (12.8 %) were included. Results The studies had diverse populations. Two were conducted in Australia, five in Canada, one in Korea, and four in the United States of America. The studies used a variety of cognitive tests and reported mixed results regarding the differences in patient performance when assessed in-person as compared to telemedicine consultation. Overall, both patients and physicians reported satisfaction with telemedicine; however, there were mixed results regarding the reliability of cognitive tests and the infrastructure required. Convenience, satisfaction, comfort and recommending telemedicine were reported to be high in the telemedicine group and physicians reported they would use telemedicine again. Conclusion The testing conditions and the accessibility of telemedicine yield inconclusive results as to whether telemedicine can improve the management of dementia in geriatric individuals.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.09.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.09.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.09.001,2021-01-01,,,

1255,Children and COVID19: Understanding impact on the growth trajectory of an evolving generation,"The COVID19 pandemic has forced the world to be closed in a shell. It has affected large population worldwide, but studies regarding its effect on children very limited. The majority of the children, who may not be able to grasp the entire emergency, are at a bigger risk with other problems lurking behind the attack of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The risk of infection in children was 1.3%, 1.5%, and 1.7% of total confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, Italy and United States respectively which is less compared to 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), when 5–7% of the positive cases were children, with no deaths reported while another recent multinational multicentric study from Europe which included 582 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) confirmed children of 0–18 year of age, provide deeper and generalize incite about clinical effects of COVID19 infection in children. According to this study 25% children have some pre-existing illness and 8% required ICU (intensive care unit) admission with 0.69% case fatality among all infected children. Common risk factor for serious illness as per this study are younger age, male sex and pre-existing underlying chronic medical condition. However, we need to be more concerned about possible implications of indirect and parallel psychosocial and mental health damage due to closure of schools, being in confinement and lack of peer interaction due to COVID19 related lockdown and other containment measures. The effects can range from mood swings, depression, anxiety symptoms to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, while no meaningful impact on COVID19 related mortality reduction is evident with school closure measures. The objective of this paper is to look at both the positive & negative effects in children due to COVID19 related indirect effects following lockdown and other containment measures. There is a need to gear up in advance with psychological strategies to deal with it post the pandemic by involving all stakeholders (parents, teachers, paediatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, psychiatric social workers, counsellors), proposing an integrated approach to help the children to overcome the pandemic aftermath.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105754,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105754,Scopus,10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105754,2021-01-01,,,

While lockdowns can help to contain the spread of the virus, they may result in substantial damage to population well-being. We use Google Trends data to test whether COVID-19 and the associated lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search-terms. Using difference-in-differences and a regression discontinuity design, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US.

1280,What motivates Chinese consumers to avoid information about the COVID-19 pandemic?: The perspective of the stimulus-organism-response model,"This study investigated consumers’ information-avoidance behavior in the context of a public health emergency—the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, it proposes a model for exploring the effects of external stimuli (perceived threat and perceived information overload) related to COVID-19 on consumers’ internal states (sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance) and their subsequent behavioral intentions to avoid health information and engage in preventive behaviors. With a survey sample (N = 721), we empirically examined the proposed model and tested the hypotheses. The results indicate that sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance, which were a result of perceived threat and perceived information overload, had heterogeneous effects on information avoidance. Anxiety and cognitive dissonance increased information avoidance intention, while sadness decreased information avoidance intention. Moreover, information avoidance predicted a reluctance on the part of consumers to engage in preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings not only contribute to the information behavior literature and extend the concept of information avoidance to a public health emergency context, but also yield practical insights for global pandemic control.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102407,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102407,Scopus,10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102407,2021-01-01,,,

One hundred and thirty persons (101 women and 25 men; 4 did not report their gender)participated in the baseline measurement of trait emotional intelligence, positive and negative affect, and affect intensity and in a one-week daily diary. Trait emotional intelligence correlated positively with baseline positive affect and positive intensity, while negatively with baseline negative affect and negative intensity. Trait emotional intelligence marginally significantly predicted a lower frequency of anger, disgust, and sadness during the first week of the pandemic. Trait emotional intelligence predicted a lower intensity of fear, anxiety and sadness. The study showed a complex dynamics of emotional experiences during the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic. Positive states of relaxation and happiness were experienced more frequently and more intensely compared to the negatively-valenced emotions.

Informed by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication Model and Health Belief Model, it proposes a conceptual model to study how people in Wuhan – the first epicenter of the global COVID-19 pandemic – used social media and its effects on users' mental health conditions and health behavior change. The results show that social media usage was related to both depression and secondary trauma, which also predicted health behavior change. But no relation was detected between health behavior change and mental health conditions. As the virus struck, social media usage was rewarding to Wuhan people who gained informational, emotional, and peer support from the health information shared on social media. An excessive use of social media, however, led to mental health issues. The results imply that taking a social media break may promote well-being during the pandemic, which is crucial to mitigating mental health harm inflicted by the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106524,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106524,Scopus,10.1016/j.chb.2020.106524,2021-01-01,,,

1299,Psychological Risk Factors of Functional Impairment After COVID-19 Deaths,"Context People bereaved from COVID-19 report higher levels of grief than people bereaved from natural causes. The full impact of this onslaught of grief will not be known for some time. Ensuring high-quality bereavement care in the context of COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to end-of-life care. Objectives We aimed to determine how psychological symptoms explain functional impairment. Methods A sample of people bereaved through COVID-19 (N = 307) in the United States completed demographic questions and self-report measures of neuroticism; symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress, separation distress, and dysfunctional grief; and functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss. Results Most participants’ scores were in the clinical ranges for generalized anxiety, depression, dysfunctional grief, and functional impairment. Functional impairment scores were not associated with age, gender, and time since loss but were associated with being diagnosed with COVID-19, having received professional help with the loss, and a close relationship to the deceased. A logistic regression model showed that, after controlling for covariates, the odds of functional impairment significantly increased by 27% for higher scores in separation distress, 25% for higher scores in dysfunctional grief, and 13% for higher scores in posttraumatic stress. Conclusion People bereaved because of COVID-19 are at risk of functional impairment, especially if they have symptoms of separation distress, dysfunctional grief, and/or posttraumatic stress. Attention to identifying and treating functional impairment may be important in facilitating grieving persons’ full participation in social and economic life during and after the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.01.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.01.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.01.006,2021-01-01,,,
1300,Assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak and its related factors on Lebanese individuals with physical disabilities,"Background In February 2020, the Lebanese authorities announced the first Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) case. Since then, the cases increased significantly, but information on the public’s psychological status and specifically individuals with physical disabilities is still limited. Purpose The study aims to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Lebanese individuals with physical disabilities and study the associated factors. Materials and methods This is a cross-sectional study involving 118 individuals with physical disabilities. Each filled out an online survey with three sections: a personal questionnaire, the Arabic versions of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 and the Fear of COVID-19 scale. Data regarding participants’ baseline characteristics, fear, anxiety, and depression were collected and analyzed using the Chi-square test and regressions models. Results Individuals with physical disabilities exhibited mild fear of COVID-19, with fear being correlated with age, educational level, and employment status. Furthermore, 22.9% of the population was found to be anxious, and 31.5% were depressed. Anxiety was associated with both marital status and employment status. Finally, depression was proved to be influenced by marital status, employment, and educational level. Conclusion Results extracted showed that individuals with physical disabilities require substantial attention in order to manage their psychological state during pandemics.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101073,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101073,Scopus,10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101073,2021-01-01,,,

Methods Data of 43,995 Brazilian adults from a cross-sectional, nationwide behavior research were used. Participants reported the frequency on loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen or depressed) and anxiety (feel worried, anxious or nervous) feelings during the pandemic period. Frequency and duration of physical activity as well as duration of TV-viewing before and during the pandemic period were also reported. We created four categories of reported changes in physical activity (1-consistently active, 2-become active, 3-become inactive or 4-consistently inactive) and TV-viewing (1-consistently high, 2-become low, 3-become high or 4-consistently high). Participants also reported previous diagnoses of depression [yes (PD) or no (nPD). Logistic regression models separating people with and without depression were created. Results Compared to consistently active participants, to become inactive during the pandemic was associated with a higher odds for loneliness [nPD:OR:1.32 (95%CI,1.02–1.70); PD:2.22 (1.21–4.06)], sadness [nPD:1.34 (1.01–1.77); PD:2.88 (1.54–5.36)], and anxiety [nPD:1.71 (1.30–2.25); PD:2.55 (1.20–5.42)]. Also, people with depression and consistently physically inactive presented higher odds for loneliness and sadness. Compared to consistently low TV-viewing, participants that become with high TV-viewing showed higher odds for loneliness [nPD:1.59 (1.37–1.86)], sadness [nPD:1.68 (1.44–1.96); PD:1.61 (1.21 to 2.15)] and anxiety [nPD:1.73 (1.48–2.02); PD:1.58 (1.12–2.23)]. Conclusions Reported increases in physical inactivity and TV-viewing during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with poorer mental health indicators.

1305,The Psychological Functioning in the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Association With Psychological Flexibility and Broader Functioning in People With Chronic Pain,"Aims: People with chronic pain may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic COVID-19, and psychological flexibility may protect them. This study investigates psychological functioning in the context of COVID-19, including fear and avoidance in the context of COVID-19, specifically its association with daily functioning, and the role of psychological flexibility, among people with chronic pain. Methods: Responses from 555 adults with chronic pain were collected through a cross-sectional online survey and analyzed. Results: Eight out of 10 participants reported significant depression and nearly 9 out of 10 reported significant functional impairment. COVID-19-related fear and avoidance significantly correlated with pain, pain-related disability, depression, and work and social adjustment (r = 18–.32), as well as psychological flexibility processes, including pain acceptance, self-as-context, and committed action, |r|=.13–.30. COVID-19-related fear and avoidance and COVID-19-related interference were significant predictors of some measures of daily functioning beyond demographics and pain, β = .09–.14. However, these associations weakened when psychological flexibility processes were factored into the models, with fear of COVID-19 no longer being a significant predictor of pain-related disability or depression, and COVID-19 avoidance no longer a significant predictor of depression. Conclusions: The psychological functioning in the context of COVID-19 appears to be negatively associated with daily functioning in people with chronic pain, and is statistically significant in this regard. Psychological flexibility may have a role in these associations for people with chronic pain in the pandemic. Perspective This article demonstrates the psychological implication of COVID-19 and its association with broader emotional and daily functioning in people with chronic pain. It also demonstrates that Psychological flexibility may have a role in these associations for people with chronic pain in the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2021.02.011,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2021.02.011,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpain.2021.02.011,2021-01-01,,,
1306,Can we predict who will be more anxious and depressed in the COVID-19 ward?,"Objective Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for anxiety and depression, but most studies about mental health during the pandemic included the general public, healthcare workers, and students. We aimed to explore the anxiety and depression levels, prevalence and predictors in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods In this cross-sectional, exploratory study, sociodemographic and clinical features of 281 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were explored. Patients underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered through a telephonic interview. Results The mean age of the participants was 55.0 ± 14.9 years. One hundred forty-three (50.9%) patients were male, and 138 (49.1%) were female. Ninety-eight (34.9%) patients had significant levels of anxiety and 118 (42.0%) had significant levels of depression. Female gender, staying alone in a hospital room, early days of hospital stay, and any lifetime psychiatric disorder was associated with symptoms of anxiety. Being over 50 years of age, staying alone in a hospital room, and NSAID use before the week of hospital admission were associated with symptoms of depression. Anxiety and depression levels were lower when family members who tested positive for COVID-19 stayed in the same hospital room during treatment. Conclusion Women, patients >50 years, patients who used NSAIDs before hospital admission, and those with lifetime psychiatric disorders may be at risk for anxiety and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 ward. Allowing family members with COVID-19 to stay in the same hospital room may be associated with lower anxiety and depression levels.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110302,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110302,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110302,2021-01-01,,,

1312,Depression and insomnia in COVID-19 survivors: a cross-sectional survey from Chinese rehabilitation centers in Anhui province,"Background Suffering from COVID-19 is a strong psychological stressor to the patients. Even after recovery, patients are prone to a variety of mental health problems. Recently, some studies focus on the psychological situation of patients when they got COVID-19. However, no study focused on the psychological status of recovered COVID-19-infected patients in China. Our study aims to investigate sleep and mood status, and detect the influencing factors of the psychological status of the COVID-19 patients after recovery. Methods One hundred and twenty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled from February to April 2020. The social demographic information of all participants was collected by a self-designed questionnaire. Insomnia and depression symptoms were evaluated through the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D). Results The rates of insomnia and depression were 26.45% and 9.92% in the COVID-19 patients after recovery. There were significant differences in physical, mental impairment, and the need for psychological assistance between the COVID-19 recovered patients with depression and the patients without depression. In addition, age and health status may be the influencing factors for insomnia, and care about the views of others may be the influencing factor of depression (P < 0.05). Conclusions Based on the results, we found that COVID-19 recovered patients had a low rate of depression and a high rate of insomnia.

Several factors influencing risk perception have been identified, including knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states. Prior studies on COVID-19-related risk perception primarily focused on the general public, with little data available on COVID-19 patients. Purpose To investigate COVID-19 patients’ risk perception, knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states in the epicenter, Wuhan, during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods Data were collected online using self-administered electronic questionnaire developed with reference to previous relevant studies and publications by the World Health Organization. Findings A higher level of perceived risk was found in relation to COVID-19 as compared to other potential health threats. Knowledge gaps existed regarding transmission and prevention of COVID-19. Additionally, risk perception was negatively related to knowledge and positively related to depressive states. Moreover, social media was a primary source for COVID-19 information, whereas the most trusted sources were health professionals. Discussion Realistic perception of risk should be encouraged considering both physical and mental health while developing relevant strategies. Furthermore, risk communication needs to be specifically tailored for various target groups, such as the elderly and mentally vulnerable individuals, with the adoption of popular media platforms.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2020.08.005,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2020.08.005,Scopus,10.1016/j.outlook.2020.08.005,2021-01-01,,,

1329,"Suspension of fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic: views, emotional reactions and psychological distress among women undergoing fertility treatment","Research question What are the views and emotional reactions of patients towards the suspension of fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what are the factors affecting their psychological distress? Design A cross-sectional study conducted in an academic fertility centre. Online questionnaires were distributed between 18 April 2020 and 23 April 2020 to patients whose treatment cycle had been postponed or discontinued. The outcome measures included agreement with the reproductive society guidelines to postpone treatments; willingness to resume treatments, given the choice; patients’ emotional reactions; and psychological distress level, measured by the Mental Health Inventory validated scale. A multivariate linear regression was conducted to identify factors associated with psychological distress. Results Because of the small number of male respondents, only women were included in the analysis (n = 181). Forty-three per cent expressed disagreement with the guidelines and 82% were willing to resume treatments, given the choice. Sadness and anxiety were the most common emotional reactions expressed towards the guidelines. In the multivariate analysis, COVID-19-related anxiety (B = 0.145, P = 0.04) and disagreement with treatment suspension (B = –0.44, P = 0.001) were found to be significantly associated with patients' psychological distress. Background characteristics of patients did not contribute significantly to their distress. Conclusions Suspension of fertility treatment during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with patients' negative emotional reactions. Anxiety related to COVID-19 and disagreement with treatment suspension were found to be significantly associated with psychological distress among women undergoing fertility treatment, regardless of their background characteristics. Our findings suggest the need to monitor the mental health of patients and provide psychological support should a shutdown of fertility care re-occur.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2021.01.007,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2021.01.007,Scopus,10.1016/j.rbmo.2021.01.007,2021-01-01,,,

1332,Insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: an examination of biopsychosocial moderators,"Objective/background Healthy sleep is vital for physical and psychological health, and poor sleep can result in a myriad of negative physical and psychological outcomes. Insomnia symptoms often manifest as a result of acute life stressors or changes, and COVID-19 experiences may be one such stressor. Other known predisposing factors to insomnia may moderate the impact of COVID-19 experiences on sleep. The present study aimed to determine current levels of insomnia severity in a US sample, to investigate the relation of COVID-19 experiences to insomnia symptoms, and to determine which individuals are most susceptible to this association. Methods Data were drawn from a larger online survey investigating sleep and health outcomes across the lifespan. COVID-19 experiences were assessed with the exposure and impact subscales of the CAIR Pandemic Impact Questionnaire (C-PIQ). The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) measured insomnia symptoms. Biological, psychological, and social moderators were measured using other brief self-report measures. Results Insomnia symptoms prevalence was as follows: moderate-to-severe symptoms (25.5%), subthreshold symptoms (37.7%), and no symptoms (36.7%). Individuals’ COVID-19 experiences significantly predicted insomnia symptom severity [F(1,997) = 472.92, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.32]. This association was moderated by race, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, physical somatization, and social loneliness, but not age, gender, or education.

1335,Adolescents' Perceived Socio-Emotional Impact of COVID-19 and Implications for Mental Health: Results From a U.S.-Based Mixed-Methods Study,"Purpose COVID-19 has disrupted many aspects of adolescents' lives, yet little data are available that document their subjective experiences of the pandemic. In a mixed-methods study of U.S. adolescents, we examined (1) adolescents' perceptions of how their social and emotional lives had changed during COVID-19; and (2) associations between these perceived changes and indices of their mental health, above and beyond their prepandemic mental health status. Methods Four hundred seven U.S. adolescents (M age = 15.24, standard deviation = 1.69; 50% female; 52%, 20% African American, 17% Hispanic/Latinx) completed surveys before (October 2019) and during (April 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. They provided qualitative and quantitative responses on their experiences with COVID-19 and reports of their mental health. Results Adolescents perceived various changes in their relationships with family and friends (e.g., less perceived friend support) during COVID-19. They also perceived increases in negative affect and decreases in positive affect. These perceived social and emotional changes were associated with elevated depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and loneliness in April 2020, controlling for mental health problems before the pandemic.

1338,Medicaid prescription limits and their implications for naloxone accessibility,"Background Expanding access to and utilization of naloxone is a vitally important harm reduction strategy for preventing opioid overdose deaths, particularly in vulnerable populations like Medicaid beneficiaries. The objective of this study was to characterize the landscape of monthly prescription fill limit policies in Medicaid programs and their potential implications for expanding naloxone use for opioid overdose harm reduction. Methods A cross-sectional, multi-modal online and telephonic data collection strategy was used to identify and describe the presence and characteristics of monthly prescription fill limit policies across state Medicaid programs. Contextual characteristics were described regarding each state’s Medicaid enrollment, opioid prescribing rates, and overdose death rates. Data collection and analysis occurred between February and May 2020. Results Medicaid-covered naloxone fills are currently subject to monthly prescription fill limit policies in 10 state Medicaid programs, which cover 20 % of the Medicaid population nationwide. Seven of these programs are located in states ranking in the top 10 highest per-capita opioid prescribing rates in the country. However, 8 of these programs are located in states with opioid overdose death rates below the national average. Conclusions Medicaid beneficiaries at high risk of opioid overdose living in states with monthly prescription fill limits may experience significant barriers to obtaining naloxone. Exempting naloxone from Medicaid prescription limit restrictions may help spur broader adoption of naloxone for opioid overdose mortality prevention, especially in states with high opioid prescribing rates. Achieving unfettered naloxone coverage in Medicaid is critical as opioid overdoses and Medicaid enrollment increase amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108355,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108355,Scopus,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108355,2021-01-01,,,

1341,"Disease, downturns, and wellbeing: Economic history and the long-run impacts of COVID-19","How might COVID-19 affect human capital and wellbeing in the long run? The COVID-19 pandemic has already imposed a heavy human cost—taken together, this public health crisis and its attendant economic downturn appear poised to dwarf the scope, scale, and disruptiveness of most modern pandemics. What evidence we do have about other modern pandemics is largely limited to short-run impacts. Consequently, recent experience can do little to help us anticipate and respond to COVID-19’s potential long-run impact on individuals over decades and even generations. History, however, offers a solution. Historical crises offer closer analogues to COVID-19 in each of its key dimensions—as a global pandemic, as a global recession—and offer the runway necessary to study the life-course and intergenerational outcomes. In this paper, we review the evidence on the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital of both historical pandemics (with a focus on the 1918 Influenza Pandemic) and historical recessions (with a focus on the Great Depression).

1343,Perceptions and experiences of 7-8 year old schoolchildren in the Basque Country during the COVID-19 health alert,"Objetivo Explorar las experiencias y las vivencias de escolares de 7-8 años en una situación excepcional de alerta sanitaria en la que se han aplicado a la población estrictas medidas de confinamiento. Método Estudio cualitativo exploratorio a través del análisis de ilustraciones realizadas por 71 escolares de 7-8 años de edad. El análisis se llevó a cabo según el marco teórico de Rose. Se realizó análisis descriptivo de los datos sociodemográficos. Resultados Del análisis del contenido emergieron cinco categorías: 1) sentimientos de tristeza y miedo; 2) importancia del núcleo familiar, seguridad y protección; 3) hábitos de vida sedentarios durante el confinamiento; 4) infraestructuras de las viviendas y desigualdades sociales (la vida tras una ventana); y 5) respuesta social, lucha colectiva y de los/las profesionales de la salud. Conclusiones La situación de pandemia de COVID-19 y las medidas estrictas de confinamiento han tenido un importante impacto en la población escolar, que es la que ha vivido las mayores restricciones. La infraestructura del hogar se ha mostrado como un claro diferenciador que ahonda en las desigualdades sociales y el impacto que la situación tiene en los/las escolares. Es necesario ampliar los estudios acerca del impacto psicosocial que esta situación va a tener a largo plazo en su salud física y mental. Objective To explore the experiences of schoolchildren in an exceptional health alert situation in which strict confinement measures have been applied to the population. Method Qualitative exploratory study through the analysis of illustrations carried out by schoolchildren aged 7 to 8. The analysis was carried out according to Rose's theoretical framework. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic data was performed. Results Five categories emerged from the analysis of the content: 1) feelings of sadness and fear; 2) importance of the family nucleus, safety and protection; 3) sedentary living habits during confinement; 4) housing infrastructure and social inequalities (life through a window); and 5) social response, collective struggle and through health professionals. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic situation and the strict confinement measures have had a significant impact on the school population, who had experienced the greatest restrictions. Household infrastructure has been shown to be a clear differentiator that deepens social inequalities and the impact that the situation has on school children.

1346,Changes to the sebum lipidome upon COVID-19 infection observed via rapid sampling from the skin,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented demand for testing - for diagnosis and prognosis - as well as for investigation into the impact of the disease on the host metabolism. Sebum sampling has the potential to support both needs by looking at what the virus does to us, rather than looking for the virus itself. Methods In this pilot study, sebum samples were collected from 67 hospitalised patients (30 COVID-19 positive and 37 COVID-19 negative) by gauze swab. Lipidomics analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, identifying 998 reproducible features. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to the resulting feature set. Findings Lipid levels were depressed in COVID-19 positive participants, indicative of dyslipidemia; p-values of 0·022 and 0·015 were obtained for triglycerides and ceramides respectively, with effect sizes of 0·44 and 0·57. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis showed separation of COVID-19 positive and negative participants with sensitivity of 57% and specificity of 68%, improving to 79% and 83% respectively when controlled for confounding comorbidities. Interpretation COVID-19 dysregulates many areas of metabolism; in this work we show that the skin lipidome can be added to the list. Given that samples can be provided quickly and painlessly, we conclude that sebum is worthy of future consideration for clinical sampling.

1359,Pulmonary function and health-related quality of life after COVID-19 pneumonia,"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many cases of pneumonia with extensive lung abnormalities on CT-scans. The consequences of COVID-19 pneumonia on survivors’ pulmonary function and quality of life are unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 pneumonia on pulmonary function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived dyspnoea. Methods. A prospective longitudinal cohort study regarding patients discharged from our hospital after PCR-proven, non-critical COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. Cases were classified as moderate or severe pneumonia according to WHO definitions. Six weeks post-discharge subjects underwent interviews and pulmonary function tests, and completed questionnaires to assess their HRQoL, perceived dyspnoea (Borgscale and mMRC), and symptoms of depression and anxiety (HADS). Results. 101 patients were included. Twenty-eight (27.7%) pneumonias were classified as moderate cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and 73 (72.3%) were classified as severe cases. Diffusion limitation (DLCOc < 80% of predicted value) was found in 66 (71.7%) of 92 cases, obstruction in 26 (25.7%) of 101, and restriction in 21 (21.2%) of 99. Diffusion capacity was significantly lower in cases after severe pneumonia. In the entire group, HADS scores ≥8 for depression were found in 16.6% and in 12.5% for anxiety. Across all SF-36 domains, except for bodily pain, significant impairment was found. FEV1 and DLCOc showed significant positive correlations with mMRC scores and multiple SF-36 domains, especially physical functioning. Conclusion. COVID-19 non-critical pneumonia survivors have significant impairment in diffusion capacity and HRQOL six weeks after being discharged from hospital.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106272,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106272,Scopus,10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106272,2021-01-01,,,
1360,Infant feeding initiation practices in the context of COVID-19 lockdown,"Objective Limited information is available regarding barriers to breastfeeding during the COVID-19 lockdown. Study design This study was designed as a non-concurrent case-control study on breastfeeding initiation practices, defined according to WHO, in women giving birth during lockdown, between March 8 and May 18, 2020, in the COVID-19 ‘hotspot’ in Northeastern Italy (study group), with an antecedent puerperae-matched group (control group). Exclusive, complementary, and formula feeding practices were collected from maternal charts at hospital discharge, on the second day post-partum, when puerperae filled out the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results The COVID-19 study group presented significantly lower exclusive breastfeeding rates than the control group who members gave birth the previous year (−15%, p = 0.003), as a consequence of the significantly higher prevalence of complementary feeding practices in the former (+20%, p = 0.002). Conversely, the COVID-19 study group showed significantly higher EPDS scores (8.03 ± 4.88 vs. 8.03 ± 4.88, p < 0.005) and higher anhedonia (0.56 ± 0.65 vs. 0.18 ± 0.38, p < 0.001) and depression (0.62 ± 0.60 vs. 0.39 ± 0.44, <0.001) subscale scores. In the general linear model analysis, women practicing exclusive breastfeeding showed significantly lower EPDS scores in comparison with those practicing complementary (p = 0.003) and formula feedings (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the highest EPDS scores were observed in women adopting formula feeding, mainly during the COVID-19 quarantine (p = 0.019). Conclusion This study indicates that hospital containment measures adopted during lockdown in the ‘hotspot’ COVID-19 epidemic area of Northeastern Italy have a detrimental effect on maternal emotions and on breastfeeding exclusivity practices.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105286,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105286,Scopus,10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105286,2021-01-01,,,

1365,Time-resolved systems immunology reveals a late juncture linked to fatal COVID-19,"COVID-19 exhibits extensive patient-to-patient heterogeneity. To link immune response variation to disease severity and outcome over time, we longitudinally assessed circulating proteins as well as 188 surface protein markers, transcriptome, and T cell receptor sequence simultaneously in single peripheral immune cells from COVID-19 patients. Conditional-independence network analysis revealed primary correlates of disease severity, including gene expression signatures of apoptosis in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and attenuated inflammation but increased fatty acid metabolism in CD56dimCD16hi NK cells linked positively to circulating interleukin (IL)-15. CD8+ T cell activation was apparent without signs of exhaustion. Although cellular inflammation was depressed in severe patients early after hospitalization, it became elevated by days 17–23 post symptom onset, suggestive of a late wave of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, circulating protein trajectories at this time were divergent between and predictive of recovery versus fatal outcomes.

1386,Mental Health Multimorbidity among Caregivers of Older Adults During the COVID-19 Epidemic,"Objective To investigate mental health status and associated factors among caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods From March 1 to 31, 2020, 916 caregivers of older adults participated in an online cross-sectional survey on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. The seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was administered to measure anxiety symptoms, the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to assess depressive symptoms, and a self-developed questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality and duration. Six questions about COVID-19-related experiences were used to assess community-level infection contact and the level of exposure to media information. The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression and sleep problems were computed. The Wald χ2 were applied to compare the differences between subgroups. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and multimorbidity. Results The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems were 46.8%, 29.8%, and 10.8%, respectively. Approximately 263 participants (28.7%) presented with two or more mental health problems. Being female (OR, 2.254; 95% CI, 1.510–3.363), having community-level COVID-19 contact (OR, 1.856; 95% CI, 1.189–2.898), and having a mental disorder (OR, 3.610; 95% CI, 1.644–7.930) were associated with increased risk of multimorbidity among caregivers. Caregivers who preferred positive information (OR, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.472–0.899) had reduced risk of multimorbidity. Conclusion Anxiety and depression were common among caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic. Being female and having community-level COVID-19 contact were independent risk factors for experiencing multiple mental health problems. Preexisting mental disorders increased the risk of multimorbidity among caregivers, while enhanced access to positive media information decreased the risk of multimorbidity.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2021.01.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2021.01.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.jagp.2021.01.006,2021-01-01,,,

1391,"The role of psychological flexibility in the context of COVID-19: Associations with depression, anxiety, and insomnia","Evidence for detrimental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and well-being around the world is now accumulating. As it does a next step is to understand how such effects can be mitigated, such as by studying psychological capacities that may afford people immunity against these impacts. In this study, we explore psychological flexibility (PF) and grit as potential resilience factors in the context of COVID-19. Standardized measures of depression, anxiety, and insomnia as well as measures of PF (committed action and inflexibility) and grit (perseverance of effort and consistency of interest) were administered through a large scale national online survey (N = 1102; mean age 36,9 years; 75% women). As predicted, the results show both PF and grit to be negatively associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Further, regression models including relevant background variables and both sets of resilience factors showed that total variance accounted for in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was substantial, 50.5%, 49.5%, and 28.8%, respectively, with the PF components accounting for most of the explained variance in mental health. We conclude that PF and to a lesser extent grit may be important psychological resilience factors against mental health problems in the context of COVID-19. Our findings are practically important as they point to malleable public health targets during the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 and in the event of similar widespread health threats in the future.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.11.003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.11.003,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.11.003,2021-01-01,,,

1394,Prevalence of depression during the COVID-19 outbreak: A meta-analysis of community-based studies,"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic, declared on March 11, 2020, constitute an extraordinary health, social and economic global challenge. The impact on people's mental health is expected to be high. This paper sought to systematically review community-based studies on depression conducted during the COVID-19 and estimate the pooled prevalence of depression. Method: We searched for cross-sectional, community-based studies listed on PubMed or Web of Science from January 1, 2020 to May 8, 2020 that reported prevalence of depression. A random effect model was used to estimate the pooled proportion of depression. Results: A total of 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis, with prevalence rates of depression ranging from 7.45% to 48.30%. The pooled prevalence of depression was 25% (95% CI: 18%−33%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I 2 =99.60%, p <.001). Conclusions: Compared with a global estimated prevalence of depression of 3.44% in 2017, our pooled prevalence of 25% appears to be 7 times higher, thus suggesting an important impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on people's mental health.

1402,Mental health impact of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on Spanish healthcare workers: A large cross-sectional survey,"Introduction Healthcare workers are vulnerable to adverse mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors during the first wave of the pandemic among healthcare professionals in Spain. Methods All workers in 18 healthcare institutions (6 AACC) in Spain were invited to web-based surveys assessing individual characteristics, COVID-19 infection status and exposure, and mental health status (May 5 – September 7, 2020). We report: probable current mental disorders (Major Depressive Disorder-MDD- [PHQ-8≥10], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD- [GAD-7≥10], Panic attacks, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder –PTSD- [PCL-5≥7]; and Substance Use Disorder –SUD-[CAGE-AID≥2]. Severe disability assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale was used to identify probable “disabling” current mental disorders. Results 9,138 healthcare workers participated. Prevalence of screen-positive disorder: 28.1% MDD; 22.5% GAD, 24.0% Panic; 22.2% PTSD; and 6.2% SUD. Overall 45.7% presented any current and 14.5% any disabling current mental disorder. Workers with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders had almost twice the prevalence than those without. Adjusting for all other variables, odds of any disabling mental disorder were: prior lifetime disorders (TUS: OR=5.74; 95%CI 2.53-13.03; Mood: OR=3.23; 95%CI:2.27-4.60; Anxiety: OR=3.03; 95%CI:2.53-3.62); age category 18-29 years (OR=1.36; 95%CI:1.02-1.82), caring “all of the time” for COVID-19 patients (OR=5.19; 95%CI: 3.61-7.46), female gender (OR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.27-1.96) and having being in quarantine or isolated (OR= 1.60; 95CI:1.31-1.95). Conclusions One in seven Spanish healthcare workers screened positive for a disabling mental disorder during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Workers reporting pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders, those frequently exposed to COVID-19 patients, infected or quarantined/isolated, female workers, and auxiliary nurses should be considered groups in need of mental health monitoring and support.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.12.001,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.12.001,Scopus,10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.12.001,2021-01-01,,,

1411,Right Heart Strain on Presenting 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Predicts Critical Illness in COVID-19,"Objectives This study aimed to assess the association of new right heart strain patterns on presenting 12-lead electrocardiogram (RHS-ECG) with outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Background Cardiovascular comorbidities and complications, including right ventricular dysfunction, are common and are associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The data on the clinical usefulness of the 12-lead ECG to aid with prognosis are limited. Methods This study retrospectively evaluated records from 480 patients who were consecutively admitted with COVID-19. ECGs obtained at presentation in the emergency department (ED) were considered index ECGs. RHS-ECG was defined by any new right-axis deviation, S1Q3T3 pattern, or ST depressions with T-wave inversions in leads V1 to V3 or leads II, III, and aVF. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess whether RHS-ECGs were independently associated with primary outcomes. Results ECGs from the ED were available for 314 patients who were included in the analysis. Most patients were in sinus rhythm, with sinus tachycardia being the most frequent dysrhythmia. RHS-ECG findings were present in 40 (11%) patients. RHS-ECGs were significantly associated with the incidence of adverse outcomes and an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR]: 15.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.1 to 45.2; p < 0.001), the need for mechanical ventilation (adjOR: 8.8; 95% CI: 3.4 to 23.2; p < 0.001), and their composite (adjOR: 12.1; 95% CI: 4.3 to 33.9]; p < 0.001).

1414,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health in Spain: Positive and negative outcomes,"Background Previous studies have shown that perinatal distress has a negative influence on pregnancy outcome and the physiological development of the baby. Objective The aim of this study was to describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal perinatal mental health in Spain. Methods Seven hundred and twenty-four women (N=450 pregnancy, N=274 postpartum) were recruited online during the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were administered. Variables related to sociodemographic information, the COVID-19 pandemic, and perinatal care were also assessed. Findings The results showed that 58% of women reported depressive symptoms. Moreover, 51% of women reported anxiety symptoms. On the other hand, a regression analysis for life satisfaction showed that besides the perception about their own health, marital status or being a health practitioner were also significant predictors during pregnancy. However, perception about baby’s health and sleep, perception about their own health, and marital status were significant predictors of life satisfaction during the postpartum stage. Discussion Women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported high rates of psychological distress. Conclusion These results highlight the need of clinical support during this period.

Methods We analyzed data on young adults aged 18–26 years from June 15 to June 30, 2020, from the weekly, cross-sectional Household Pulse Survey (n = 4,852) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Two job insecurity measures and four anxiety and depression measures were analyzed using multivariable Poisson regression models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. Results Fifty-nine percent of participants experienced direct or household employment loss since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 38% were expected to experience direct or household employment loss in the coming 4 weeks.

1437,"An insight into the mental health needs of the common public of Tamil Nadu, India, subjected to COVID-19 lockdown, a rare unprecedented crisis","Purpose COVID-19, a major “Public Health Emergencies of International Concern”, had sought greater attention among researchers to study its pathogenesis, associated complications and management. However, there are only few studies that had studied its potential impact on mental health of general public, who are subjected to social distancing, community lockdown and restrictions in their routine activities. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and mental health needs among general public in Tamil Nadu subjected to lockdown, social distancing amidst COVID-19 crisis. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected states of southern India. Methods A self-administered, web-based application study using “WHO-Self Reported Questionnaire-20”, in bilingual version, both English and Tamil, is used to screen the public for the level of distress. The study is done while the state is under extended lockdown and restricted movement. Key findings A total of 918 respondents participated in the survey and it is found that about more than one third of the respondents (∼35%) are under psychological distress. A significant association between younger age group, female gender, unmarried, people with children are found to be under distress. The lockdown had increased the frequency of smoking and quantity of cigarettes among smokers, also has increased the frequency of drinking among alcohol consumers. Of the SRQ-20 items recorded, stress related neurotic symptoms (>70%) was observed more than the depressive mood. About 33% of those scored>7, had suicidal tendency. The districts declared red zones had significantly reported a greater number of respondents under distress. Conclusion Besides effectively mitigating the COVID-19 crisis, in terms of prevention, control and treatment strategies, it is prerogative to effectively manage fear, distress due to the COVID-19 and associated anxiety and depression among the public.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.013,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.013,Scopus,10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.013,2021-01-01,,,

Adapting to a “new normal” continues to be an unsettling experience for many of us. For individuals with chronic pain, adaptation is familiar. In this study we turn to their experience to better understand what resilience can look like in the setting of major life changes. Participants were recruited from an outpatient pain management clinic from mid-March through June 2020 and completed measures assessing resilience, chronic pain acceptance, and an open-ended question examining the impact of chronic pain on their experience during COVID-19. Qualitative and quantitative analyses identified themes of acceptance and resilience. Furthermore, baseline depression was found to be associated with less cognitive/affective positivity (an aspect of resilience) and less pain willingness (an aspect of acceptance). In this brief snapshot of the chronic pain experience, we are reminded of the invaluable lessons learned from our patients. They offer us a model of resilience from which we can foster our own overall wellbeing in the context of continued stress and disruption.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.10.010,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.10.010,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.10.010,2021-01-01,,,

This proportion of cuts and omissions is three to five times higher than any other quarter since 2015. The 2008 financial crisis was characterized by a high proportion of financial firms cutting dividends without much change in dividends for non-financials. Conversely, we find evidence of increased dividend cuts across all industries. The most common industry grouping, industrials, experienced one out of every six firms cutting dividends. Regression results indicate that net income and debt are determinants of firms cutting dividends in all periods, but the economic significance is much greater during the pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2020.101910,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2020.101910,Scopus,10.1016/j.frl.2020.101910,2021-01-01,,,

1454,Effect of COVID-19 confinement on the mental status of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,"Antecedentes y objetivo Las pacientes con lupus eritematoso sistémico (LES) son más vulnerables a presentar mayores niveles de estrés y síntomas psicopatológicos que la población general sana, por lo que el brote de la COVID-19 podría alterar su estado psicológico. El objetivo fue analizar el impacto psicológico de la pandemia y del confinamiento sobre los niveles de estrés y sintomatología psicopatológica en pacientes con LES. Pacientes y método En este estudio transversal se compararon niveles de estrés mediante la Escala de Estrés Percibido y el Inventario de Vulnerabilidad al Estrés, y síntomas psicopatológicos mediante el Inventario de síntomas SCL-90-R, en pacientes con LES durante el período de confinamiento (grupo 1; n=276) con respecto a pacientes con LES evaluadas en un período anterior a la pandemia (grupo 2; n=152). Resultados La comparación entre ambos grupos mostró que existían diferencias estadísticamente significativas en vulnerabilidad al estrés (p<0,0001), depresión (p≤0,05), ansiedad (p≤0,05), ansiedad fóbica (p<0,0001), sensibilidad interpersonal (p≤0,043), y psicoticismo (p≤0,023). En estas variables el grupo de pacientes con lupus en confinamiento obtuvo puntuaciones superiores. Conclusiones El confinamiento y la amenaza del brote por COVID-19 ha tenido importantes repercusiones en el estado psicológico de las pacientes con LES, mostrando altos niveles de estrés, ansiedad y depresión. Estos hallazgos muestran su vulnerabilidad ante una alerta de salud pública, y señala la necesidad de realizar un abordaje psicológico de estas pacientes mientras dure el estado de emergencia sanitaria, así como ante posibles rebrotes del virus. Background and objective Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are more vulnerable to higher levels of stress and psychopathological symptoms than the general healthy population. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. Patients and method In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n=276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n=152). Results The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (P <.0001), depression (P ≤.05), anxiety (P ≤.05), phobic anxiety (P <.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (P ≤.043), and psychoticism (P ≤.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. Conclusions The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings show their vulnerability to a public health alert and indicate the need to carry out a psychological approach to these patients while the state of health emergency lasts as well as to possible outbreaks of the virus.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004,Scopus,10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004,2021-01-01,,,

1468,Gender as a moderator between Present-Hedonistic time perspective and depressive symptoms or stress during COVID-19 lock-down,"Although numerous studies have addressed the impact of the COVID-19 lock-downs on psychological distress, scarce data is available relating to the role of Present-Hedonistic (PH) time perspective and gender differences in the development of depressive symptoms and stress during the period of strict social distancing. We hypothesized that gender would moderate the relationship between PH and depressiveness or stress levels, such that PH would negatively correlate with psychological distress in women but correlate positively in men. The present study was online and questionnaire-based. N = 230 participants aged 15–73 from the general population took part in the study. The results of moderation analysis allowed for full acceptance of the hypothesis for depression as a factor, but for stress the hypothesis was only partially confirmed, since the relationship between PH time perspective and stress was not significant for men (although it was positive, as expected). The findings are pioneering in terms of including PH time perspective in predicting psychological distress during the COVID-19 lock-down and have potentially significant implications for practicing clinicians, who could include the development of more adaptive time perspectives and balance them in their therapeutic work with people experiencing lock-down-related distress.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110395,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110395,Scopus,10.1016/j.paid.2020.110395,2021-01-01,,,

1474,"Trajectories of eating behavior during COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal analyses of 22,374 adults","Background & aims The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of stay-at-home and lockdown measures. It is currently unknown if the experience of lockdown leads to long term changes in individual's eating behaviors. The objectives of this study were: i) to derive longitudinal trajectories of change in eating during UK lockdown, and ii) to identify risk factors associated with eating behavior trajectories. Method Data from 22,374 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social study (a panel study collecting weekly data during the pandemic) were analyzed from 28th March to 29th May 2020. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to derive trajectories of change in eating. These were then associated with prior socio-economic, health-related and psychological factors using multinomial regression models. Results Analyses suggested five trajectories, with the majority (64%) showing no change in eating. In contrast, one trajectory was marked by persistently eating more, whereas another by persistently eating less. Overall, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report any change in eating. Loneliness was linked to persistently eating more (OR = 1.07), whereas being single or divorced, as well as stressful life events, were associated with consistently eating less (OR = 1.69). Overall, higher education status was linked to lower odds of changing eating behavior (OR = 0.54–0.77). Secondary exploratory analyses suggest that participants self-reported to have overweight were more commonly categorised into the group consistently eating more, whereas participants with underweigh persistently ate less. Conclusion In this study, we found that one third of the sample report changes in quantities eaten throughout the first UK lockdown period. Findings highlight the importance of adjusting public health programs to support eating behaviors in future lockdowns both in this and potential future pandemics. This is particularly important as part of on-going preventive efforts to prevent nutrition-related chronic diseases.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.046,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.046,Scopus,10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.01.046,2021-01-01,,,

1481,Mental health problems among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19: The importance of nutrition and physical activity,"Background/Objective Mental health problems are common among adolescents and greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence and correlates of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19. Method: Cross-sectional study (N = 1,794 adolescents, mean age = 15.26) was conducted in May 2020. An online survey was used to collect socio-demographic data, COVID-related fear (COVID-fear), nutrition, physical activity (PA) level and the symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms was 37.80%, 48.20% and 36.70%, respectively, among Chinese adolescents during the pandemic. Generalized linear models revealed that female, left behind children, and students with greater COVID-fear tended to report symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety concurrently. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and COVID-fear, better nutritional status and moderately active PA were both associated with lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, while highly active PA was associated with lower levels of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19. To promote adolescents’ mental health, educators should help adolescents develop a healthy lifestyle with balanced diet and regular exercise.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.100218,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.100218,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.100218,2021-01-01,,,

The current study examines associations among COVID-related stress, sleep quality, and mental health. Design Cross-sectional data were collected via online surveys in May 2020. Participants were 2541 community adults ages 18-70 from Israel (N = 1969) and the U.S. (N = 572). Measurement Participants completed measures of COVID-related stress, sleep quality, and symptoms of anxiety, depression and adjustment disorder. Results Participants reported high rates of depression and anxiety symptoms, adjustment difficulties, and poor sleep quality. In both countries, COVID-related stressors were associated with both anxiety and depression, and these associations were mediated by sleep disturbances.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of self-reported mental health parameters and the coping mechanisms of employees and students in a Saudi State University. Methods An online survey in both Arabic and English was launched targeting students, staff and faculty of King Saud University from May 11 to June 6, 2020, the peak of Saudi Arabia’s nationwide lockdown. A total of 1542 respondents (726 males and 816 females) aged 20–65 years old participated. Results Majority of the respondents claimed to have suffered from anxiety (58.1%), depression (50.2%) and insomnia (32.2%) during the lockdown. On average, 65.3% respondents agreed that family bond strengthened during lockdown. Those in the highest quartile of family bonding score (Q4) were 41% [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.59 (0.39–0.87), p < 0.001] and 59% [OR 0.41 (CI 0.27–0.64), p < 0.001] were less likely to be anxious and depressed, respectively, even after adjusting for covariates. This independent and significant inverse association was more apparent in females than males. Conclusion Self-reported acute mental health disorders were common within the academic community during the COVID-19 lockdown.

1498,Sleeping when the world locks down: Correlates of sleep health during the COVID-19 pandemic across 59 countries,"Objectives COVID-19 escalated into a global pandemic affecting countries around the world. As communities shut down to reduce disease spread, all aspects of life have been altered, including sleep. This study investigated changes in sleep patterns and correlates of sleep health in a global sample and examined relationships between sleep health and psychological distress. Design Cross-sectional. Settings Online survey distributed between April 19 and May 3, 2020. Participants Total 6882 participants (18-94 years) across 59 countries. Measurements Sleep health (RU-SATED), demographics, pandemic-related factors, mood. Results More than half the sample shifted their sleep toward later bed- and wake-times, and more than a third reported increased sleep disturbances during the pandemic. Older age, being partnered, and living in a higher income country were associated with better sleep health, while a stricter level of quarantine and pandemic-related factors (being laid off from job, financial strain, or difficulties transitioning to working from home) were associated with poorer sleep health. Domestic conflict was the strongest correlate of poorer sleep health. Poorer sleep health was strongly associated with greater depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants from Latin America reported the lowest sleep health scores. Conclusions COVID-19-associated factors have impacted sleep health on a global level. While our data are correlational, sleep health is strongly linked with mental health and could play a protective role against developing mental distress during pandemic-related isolation.

A 2018 law (Chapter 208) made Massachusetts (MA) the first state to mandate that five county jails deliver all FDA-approved MOUDs (naltrexone [NTX], buprenorphine [BUP], and methadone). Chapter 208 established a 4-year pilot program to expand access to all FDA-approved forms of MOUD at five jails, with two more MA jails voluntarily joining this initiative. The law stipulates that MOUD be continued for individuals receiving it prior to detention and be initiated prior to release among sentenced individuals where appropriate. The jails must also facilitate continuation of MOUD in the community on release. The Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN) partnered with these seven diverse jails, the MA Department of Public Health, and community treatment providers to conduct a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of Chapter 208. We will: (1) Perform a longitudinal treatment outcome study among incarcerated individuals with OUD who receive NTX, BUP, methadone, or no MOUD in jail to examine postrelease MOUD initiation, engagement, and retention, as well as fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose and recidivism; (2) Conduct an implementation study to understand systemic and contextual factors that facilitate and impede delivery of MOUDs in jail and community care coordination, and strategies that optimize MOUD delivery in jail and for coordinating care with community partners; (3) Calculate the cost to the correctional system of implementing MOUD in jail, and conduct an economic evaluation from state policy-maker and societal perspectives to compare the value of MOUD prior to release from jail to no MOUD among matched controls. MassJCOIN made significant progress during its first six months until the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. Participating jail sites restricted access for nonessential personnel, established other COVID-19 mitigation policies, and modified MOUD programming. MassJCOIN adapted research activities to this new reality in an effort to document and account for the impacts of COVID-19 in relation to each aim. The goal remains to produce findings with direct implications for policy and practice for OUD in criminal justice settings.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108275,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108275,Scopus,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108275,2021-01-01,,,

Thus, pregnancy may be a risk factor that could deepen the already negative effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze longitudinally the psychopathological consequences of the pandemic in pregnant women, and to explore differences with non-pregnant women. The participants in this study were 102 pregnant women, and a control group of 102 non-pregnant women (most of them reported having university studies and little financial impact from the pandemic). They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, in three different times (2, 14, and 47 days after the start of the lockdown). In a time range of 50 days of quarantine, all women showed a gradual increase in psychopathological indicators and a decrease in positive affect. Pregnant women showed a more pronounced increase in depression, anxiety and negative affect than the non-pregnant women did. In addition, pregnant women showed a more pronounced decrease in positive affect.

1526,Did child-psychiatry patients really experience the dreaded clinical degradation during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown?,"Objectifs La période de confinement qui s’est déroulée en France de la mi-mars à la mi-mai 2020, à l’occasion de la pandémie COVID-19, soulève d’importantes questions sur ses effets psychologiques directs et indirects chez les enfants et adolescents. Considérée intuitivement comme nuisible, voire traumatisante dans le discours médiatique, nous avons tenté de mieux qualifier ses effets à partir de deux démarches complémentaires. D’une part, nous avons réalisé une revue de la littérature sur le sujet, d’autre part, nous y avons associé une objectivation de l’évolution de l’état clinique global des enfants au sein de la file active du service de psychiatrie infanto-juvénile du CHRU de Brest pendant la période de confinement. La revue de la littérature portant sur les effets psychologiques de situations de confinement ou de quarantaine à l’occasion d’épidémies passées ou actuelle de COVID-19, notamment en Chine, rapporte de nombreuses données sur leurs conséquences délétères. Les effets relatés sont de nature variable : symptômes anxieux et dépressifs principalement, mais aussi Stress Post Traumatique, dans des proportions importantes. Cependant, la définition des situations vécues et les contextes dans lesquels se sont déroulées ces études sont en fait peu comparables à la situation française. Par ailleurs, les effets de la peur de la contamination n’y sont pas différenciés de ceux liés au confinement lui-même. Patients et méthodes Parmi les enfants et adolescents suivis dans le service, 354 ont bénéficié d’une mesure de l’impact du confinement sur leur état clinique global évalué à la Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) par leur praticien habituel au cours de la période du 16 mars au 11 mai 2020. Résultats Nos résultats mettent en évidence que 50 % des enfants ont connu un état clinique global inchangé en comparaison à leur état avant le confinement, 25 à 30 % ont connu une amélioration et 20 à 25 % ont montré une légère dégradation pendant la période de confinement. L’état décrit est globalement stable dans le temps au cours des huit semaines de la durée du confinement. L’âge ou la sévérité préalable de la pathologie n’a pas d’influence significative, même si on note une amélioration globale plus fréquente chez les adolescents. Conclusion Ces résultats sont assez discordants avec le discours général. Plusieurs hypothèses sont discutées pour expliquer les raisons de cette absence de dégradation qui pourrait éventuellement être étendue aux enfants et adolescents en général pendant cette période. Background The general lockdown period during the COVID-19 pandemic which covered mid-March to mid-May 2020 in France raised important questions about the direct and indirect psychological effects on children and adolescents. Perceived intuitively as harmful and even traumatic in the media's discourse, we tried to better qualify its effects from two complementary approaches. We carried out a review of the literature on the subject to which we associated a regular assessment of the children's global clinical state in the entire active file of the child-psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest throughout the lockdown period. The findings of the literature review on the psychological effects of lockdowns or quarantines during past or current epidemics, in particular in China, report many deleterious and variable effects such as symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at a significant rate. However, the definition of the situations experienced and the contexts in which those studies took place appear to be not truly comparable to the French situation. Moreover, the effects of the fear of contamination are not differentiated from those linked to confinement itself. Patients and methods Among children and adolescents under the care of the above department, 354 underwent an assessment of the impact of lockdown on their global clinical condition using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) performed by their usual practitioner during the period from March 16 to May 11, 2020. Results Our results highlight that 50% of children remained in stable condition, 25 to 30% improved and 20 to 25% experienced a slight degradation. The evolution of the clinical status appeared stable over time during the eight weeks. The initial age or severity of mental disorder had no significant influence, although there was a slightly more frequent improvement in adolescents. Conclusion These results are quite inconsistent with general discourse and common expectations. Several psychopathological hypotheses are discussed to support this absence of psychological degradation which might even be extended to children and adolescents in the general population.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2021.02.006,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2021.02.006,Scopus,10.1016/j.neurenf.2021.02.006,2021-01-01,,,

1528,Brief Transdiagnostic Intervention for Parents With Emotional Disorder Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Example,"Concerns regarding parent mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic are justifiably on the rise. Although anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress levels have risen precipitously across all demographics during the pandemic, parents residing with their children are under particular and unique strain. Caregivers with children in the home are responsible not only for their own health, financial security, and safety during this time, but often full-time caregiving, household management and, in many cases, their children’s schooling. In this case paper, we describe the development of the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders for Caregivers (UP-Caregiver) and provide a case example of its implementation. This 4-session indicated prevention for caregivers is a modification of existing versions of the Unified Protocols for adults and children, modified to maximize its responsiveness to issues faced by parents and caregivers living with youth (ages 6–13) during the current pandemic. UP-Caregiver was offered as part of a randomized, controlled trial via telehealth in a small group format to any parent with a child in the specified age range with mild or greater anxiety, depression or traumatic stress symptoms during an initial screening. The case example provided is of a White, Hispanic mother with a range of self-reported emotional disorder concerns at an initial assessment. Declines in anxiety, depression and traumatic stress symptoms were all noted, as well as improvements in parenting self-efficacy and distress tolerance 6-weeks after initiating UP-Caregiver. An ongoing randomized, controlled trial of UP-Caregiver will further evaluate the utility and feasibility of this approach to alleviate parental distress during COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.01.002,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.01.002,Scopus,10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.01.002,2021-01-01,,,

1532,How do state policies shape experiences of household income shocks and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The tremendous job loss and wage cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns about the mental health of the population. The impacts of income shocks on mental health may differ across U.S. states during the pandemic, as states have different policy contexts that likely influence mental health. The present study uses survey data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey (April–July 2020) to examine whether mental health outcomes vary across U.S. states and to what extent specific state-level contexts moderate the associations between household income shocks and depression (n = 582,440) and anxiety (n = 582,796). We find that the prevalence of depression and anxiety differs across states by household income shock status. For individuals, living in a state with supportive social policies – primarily those related to Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and suspended utility shut offs during the pandemic – weakens the association between household income shocks and mental health. Findings suggest that the lack of a strong federal response to the pandemic alongside the devolution of federal power to states over the past 40 years contributes to inequalities in mental health across states. We provide insight about how specific existing and emergency-related policies can reduce adverse mental health consequences of household income shocks.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113557,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113557,Scopus,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113557,2021-01-01,,,

The present article meta-analyzed mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, etc.) from a previous coronavirus outbreak in China (2002). Method CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, and Google Scholar were searched up to early June 2020 for articles in English or Chinese reporting mental illness symptoms of SARS patients. Main outcome measures include SCL-90, SAS, SDS, and IES-R scales. 29 papers met the inclusion criteria. The longest follow-up time included in the analysis was 46 months. Findings The systematic meta-analysis indicated that mental health problems were most serious before or at hospital discharge and declined significantly during the first 12 months after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, average symptom levels remained above healthy norms even at 12 months and continued to improve, albeit slowly, thereafter. Interpretation The adverse mental health impact of being hospitalized with coronavirus infection long outlasts the physical illness. Mental health issues were the most serious for coronavirus infected patients before (including) hospital discharge and improved continuously during the first 12 months after hospital discharge. If COVID-19 infected patients follow a similar course of mental health development, most patients should recover to normal after 12 months of hospital discharge.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.015,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.015,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.015,2021-01-01,,,

1557,Perceived social support and prenatal wellbeing; The mediating effects of loneliness and repetitive negative thinking on anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Problem Prenatal depression and anxiety are linked to poor maternal and infant outcomes. We need to understand predictors of poor mental health to identify at-risk women, and targets for support. Background Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between low levels of perceived social support, and depression and anxiety in pregnant women. However, there is a lack of research into the factors that may mediate this relationship. Aim As social distancing measures (e.g., lockdown) are likely to negatively affect women’s perceived support in the prenatal period, we investigated the relationship between perceived social support and both anxiety and depression in UK-based pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we examined two potential mediators that may contribute to psychological symptoms: repetitive negative thinking and loneliness. Methods We administered a battery of online measures to a sample of pregnant women (N =205) between May-June 2020, during the first peak of the pandemic in the UK, when perceived social support was likely to be low. Results Consistent with predictions, perceived social support was significantly negatively related to depression, anxiety, loneliness and repetitive negative thinking. Furthermore, repetitive negative thinking and loneliness mediated the relationship between perceived social support and both depression and anxiety. Moreover, perceived social support and loneliness were associated with specific types of online behaviours. Conclusions Taken together, the findings shed light on the processes through which social support may exert its effects on depression and anxiety and highlight potential therapeutic targets for interventions which aim to prevent and treat mood disorders in perinatal cohorts.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.12.014,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.12.014,Scopus,10.1016/j.wombi.2020.12.014,2021-01-01,,,

1562,"Levels of resilience, anxiety and depression in nurses working in respiratory clinical areas during the COVID pandemic","Background The delivery of healthcare during the COVID pandemic has had a significant impact on front line staff. Nurses who work with respiratory patients have been at the forefront of the pandemic response. Lessons can be learnt from these nurses’ experiences in order to support these nurses during the existing pandemic and retain and mobilise this skilled workforce for future pandemics. Methods This study explores UK nurses’ experiences of working in a respiratory environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. An e-survey was distributed via professional respiratory societies; the survey included a resilience scale, the GAD7 (anxiety) and the PHQ9 (depression) tools. Demographic data was collected on age, gender, ethnicity, nursing experience and background, clinical role in the pandemic, and home-life and work balance. Results Two hundred and fifty-five responses were received for the survey, predominately women (89%, 226/255), aged over 35 (79%, 202/255). Nearly 21% (40/191) experiencing moderate to severe or severe symptoms of anxiety. Similar levels are seen for depression (17.2%, 31/181). 18.9% (34/180) had a low or very low resilience score. Regression analysis showed that for both depression and anxiety variables, age and years of qualification provided the best model fit. Younger nurses with less experience have higher levels of anxiety and depression and had lower resilience. Conclusion This cohort experienced significant levels of anxiety and depression, with moderate to high levels of resilience. Support mechanisms and interventions need to be put in place to support all nurses during pandemic outbreaks, particularly younger or less experienced staff.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106219,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106219,Scopus,10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106219,2021-01-01,,,

1567,Strategic inefficiencies and federal redistribution during uncoordinated response to pandemic waves,"Optimal policy during an epidemic calls for depressed economic activity to slow down the outbreak. Sometimes, these decisions are left to local authorities (e.g. states). This creates an externality, as the outbreak does not respect states’ boundaries. The externality directly exacerbates the outbreak. Indirectly, it creates a free-rider problem, because local policymakers pass the cost of fighting the outbreak on to other states. A standard system of distortionary taxes and lump-sum transfers can implement the optimal allocation, with higher tax rates required if states behave strategically. A strategic system of taxes and transfers, rewarding states which depress their economies more than average, improves the outcomes by creating a race-to-the-bottom type of response. In a symmetric equilibrium, the optimal tax rate is lower if states behave strategically.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102003,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102003,Scopus,10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102003,2021-01-01,,,
1568,Challenges and pitfalls in anesthesia for electroconvulsive therapy,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) refers to the application of electricity to the patients’ scalp to treat psychiatric disorders, most notably, treatment-resistant depression. It is a safe, effective, and evidence-based therapy that is performed with general anesthesia. Muscle relaxation is used to prevent injuries related to the tonic–clonic seizure caused by ECT. Hypnotics are administered to induce amnesia and unconsciousness, so that, patients do not experience the period of muscle relaxation, while the generalized seizure is left unnoticed. For the anesthesiologist, ECT is associated with the challenges and pitfalls that are related to informed consent, social acceptance of ECT, airway management (especially in COVID-19 patients), and the interaction between ventilation and anesthetics from one viewpoint, and seizure induction and maintenance from another. The exact mode of action of the therapy is as unknown as the optimal choice or combination of anesthetics used.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpa.2020.12.012,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpa.2020.12.012,Scopus,10.1016/j.bpa.2020.12.012,2021-01-01,,,

Method: Information was collected from 595 confined participants who reported personal and contextual information, depressive symptoms and PA levels at four time points. Results: The changes in depressive symptoms were analyzed using a linear mixed model with cubic splines. Results showed a significant increase, with a significant rise between T1 and T2 (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.83-3.10). It continued growing until T4 (OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.97-4.38). A negative relationship was observed between the increase in depressive symptoms and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels, with a significant slope up to 4 hours of MVPA per week (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.29-0.90) that tended to increase until 16 hours per week of MVPA (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20-0.87).

1592,Psycho-emotional adjustment in parents of adolescents: A cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the impact of the COVID pandemic,"Purpose: adolescence is a time of change and it generally entails a greater family vulnerability thus; the aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for poor emotional adjustment to COVID among parents of adolescents. Design and methods: 94 parents of adolescents (11–18 years old, M = 13.90, SD = 1.85) participated at different times during the state of alert in Spain. 91.5% were mothers. Their ages ranged from 35 to 63 years (M = 46.54; SD = 5.09). The variables assessed were anxiety, depression and stress (DASS), moods (MOOD), somatization (SCL) and resilience (CD-RISC). Descriptive analyses, t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations, and hierarchical regressions were performed. All this by means of a cross-sectional and longitudinal study design. Results: at the beginning of the confinement parents showed low levels of emotional distress and moderate levels of positive emotionality and resilience. However, those with a prior psychological problem, who had lost their job, or had lost someone to the pandemic, showed worse emotional adjustment. Resilience was relevant in predicting anxiety-depressive symptoms, and a low level of happiness was relevant in predicting stress. Emotional symptoms improved over time, and resilience remained stable. Conclusions: the emotional impact of COVID over time is influenced by mood, mental health, and resilience. In addition, parents who had a previous health problem, had lost their job or a loved one, had a worse adjustment. Practical implications: it is important to carry out intervention programs that increase resilience, treating parents who require it, since their emotional adjustment has repercussions on the emotional adjustment of family system.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.01.028,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.01.028,Scopus,10.1016/j.pedn.2021.01.028,2021-01-01,,,
