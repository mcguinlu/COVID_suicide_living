0,International travel in times of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from German school breaks,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered severe global restrictions on international travel with the intention of limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across countries. This paper studies the effects of the partial relaxation of these travel restrictions in Europe during the summer months of 2020. It exploits the staggered start of the summer school breaks across German states as an exogenous shock to the travel opportunities of the population. While the school breaks also increased mobility within Germany, the event study regressions include disaggregated and time-varying controls for domestic mobility and local COVID-19-related restrictions. The resulting intention-to-treat effects of the relaxed travel restrictions show a significant and sizable increase of the COVID-19 incidence in German counties during the later weeks of the school breaks.",Andreas Backhaus,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252062,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252062,2021-02-23,2021-02-23,,True
1,SARS-CoV-2 infection drives a glycan switch of peripheral T cells at diagnosis,"COVID-19 is a highly selective disease in which SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in different clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe disease that requires hospitalization. Here, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a glycosylation reprogramming of circulating lymphocytes at diagnosis. We identified a specific glycosignature of T cells, defined upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and apparently triggered by a serological factor. This specific glycan switch of T cells is detected at diagnosis being more pronounced in asymptomatic patients. We further demonstrated that asymptomatic patients display an increased expression of a viral-sensing receptor, through the up-regulation of DC-SIGN in monocytes. We showed that higher levels of DC-SIGN in monocytes at diagnosis correlates with better COVID-19 prognosis. These new evidences pave the way to the identification of a novel glycan-based response in T cells that may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients, highlighting a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target.",Ines Alves; Manuel M Vicente; Joana Gaifem; Angela Fernandes; Ana M Dias; Claudia S Rodrigues; Jose Carlos Oliveira; Nair Seixas; Luis Malheiro; Miguel A Abreu; Rui Sarmento e Castro; Salome S Pinho,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251918,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251918,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,True
2,"Factors influencing self-harm thoughts and self-harm behaviours over the first 45 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a longitudinal analysis of 48,446 adults","Background There is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath will result in excess suicides by increasing known risk factors such as self-harm. However, evidence on how pandemic-related risk factors contribute to changes in these outcomes is lacking. Aims We sought to examine how different adverse experiences and worries about adversity brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours over the first 45 weeks of the pandemic. Method Data from 48,446 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed across the first 45 weeks (1 April to 7 February 2021) of the pandemic. Fixed effects regressions explored associations between weekly within-person variation in five categories of adversity experiences and adversity worries with changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours across age groups (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+ years). Results More adverse experiences were more strongly related to outcomes than worries. Specific categories of worries and adversities had stronger associations with outcomes than others. The largest contributing factor to increases in both self-harm thoughts (odds ratio (OR) range = 3.38 to 4.00) and behaviours (OR range = 3.72 to 6.82) was physical or psychological abuse amongst all ages. Having had COVID-19 and financial worries were associated with increased likelihood of both outcomes, the latter being more consistently associated with outcomes than actual financial adversity. Conclusions These findings suggest that a significant portion of UK adults may be at increased risk for self-harm thoughts and behaviours during the pandemic, which is concerning given the link between self-harm and suicide. Policies currently place to protect and reassure citizens may be insufficient in assuaging fears and anxieties. Given the likelihood that as time goes on, the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic will accumulate, policy makers can begin adapting a variety of existing evidence-based suicide prevention strategies and other social policies to help mitigate its consequences.",Elise Paul; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252050,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252050,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,True
3,SARS-CoV-2 serostatus of healthcare worker in the Austrian state Vorarlberg between June 2020 and January 2021,"Background Austria, and particularly its westernmost federal state Vorarlberg, developed the highest COVID-19 incidence rate worldwide in November 2020. Health care workers (HCW) may be at higher risk of contracting the disease within the working environment and therefore the seroprevalence in this population is of particular interest. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response in Vorarlberg HCW in a prospective cohort study. Methods A total of 395 HCW have been tested at three different time points for the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies specific for NP and RBD. Enrollment started in June 2020 (t1), two months after the end of the first wave. Re-testing took place between October to November at the beginning of the second wave (t2), and again at the end of the second wave in January 2021(t3). Results At t1, 3% of HCW showed a strong IgG-specific responses to either NP or RBD. At t2, the rate increased to 4%, and after the second wave in January 2021, 14% had a strong response, which was assessed to be stable for up to ten months. The amount of HCW with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 38% higher than the number of infections found by PCR. Conclusion We found low numbers of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive HCW in a hotspot setting after the first wave but a massive increase during the second wave distinctly surpassing the number of infected HCW identified by PCR. Our findings, therefore, offer support for the routine application of serological testing in management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",Michele Atzl; Axel Muendlein; Thomas Winder; Peter Fraunberger; Eva-Maria Brandtner; Kathrin Geiger; Miriam Klausberger; Mark Duerkop; Lukas Sprenger; Beatrix Mutschlechner; andreas volgger; Magdalena Benda; Luciano Severgnini; Johannes B Jaeger; Heinz Drexel; Alois Lang; Andreas Leiherer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252045,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252045,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,True
4,Structural Basis for Accommodation of Emerging B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 Variants by Two Potent SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies,"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, from the UK and South Africa, respectively show decreased neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and convalescent or vaccinee sera raised against the original wild-type virus, and are thus of clinical concern. However, the neutralization potency of two antibodies, 1-57 and 2-7, which target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike, was unaffected by these emerging strains. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of 1-57 and 2-7 in complex with spike, revealing each of these antibodies to utilize a distinct mechanism to bypass or accommodate RBD mutations. Notably, each antibody represented a response with recognition distinct from those of frequent antibody classes. Moreover, many epitope residues recognized by 1-57 and 2-7 were outside hotspots of evolutionary pressure for both ACE2 binding and neutralizing antibody escape. We suggest the therapeutic use of antibodies like 1-57 and 2-7, which target less prevalent epitopes, could ameliorate issues of monoclonal antibody escape.",Gabriele Cerutti; Micah Rapp; Yicheng Guo; Fabiana Bahna; Jude Bimela; Eswar R Reddem; Jian Yu; Pengfei Wang; Lihong Liu; Yaoxing Huang; David D Ho; Peter D Kwong; Zizhang Sheng; Lawrence Shapiro,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432168,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432168,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
5,Reduced binding and neutralization of infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies to the B.1.351 (South African) SARS-CoV-2 variant,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein is raising concerns about the efficacy of infection- or vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize these variants. We compared antibody binding and live virus neutralization of sera from naturally infected and spike mRNA vaccinated individuals against a circulating SARS-CoV-2 B.1 variant and the emerging B.1.351 variant. In acutely-infected (5-19 days post-symptom onset), convalescent COVID-19 individuals (through 8 months post-symptom onset) and mRNA-1273 vaccinated individuals (day 14 post-second dose), we observed an average 4.3-fold reduction in antibody titers to the B.1.351-derived receptor binding domain of the spike protein and an average 3.5-fold reduction in neutralizing antibody titers to the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant as compared to the B.1 variant (spike D614G). However, most acute and convalescent sera from infected and all vaccinated individuals neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant, suggesting that protective immunity is retained against COVID-19.",Venkata Viswanadh Edara; Carson Norwood; Katharine Floyd; Lilin Lai; Meredith E Davis-Gardner; William H Hudson; Grace Mantus; Lindsay E Nyhoff; Max W Adelman; Rebecca Fineman; Shivan Patel; Rebecca Byram; Dumingu Nipuni Gomes; Garett Michael; Hayatu Abdullahi; Nour Beydoun; Bernadine Panganiban; Nina McNair; Kieffer Hellmeister; Jamila Pitts; Joy Winters; Jennifer Kleinhenz; Jacob Usher; Anne Piantadosi; Jesse J Waggoner; Ahmed Babiker; David S Stephens; Evan J Anderson; Srilatha Edupuganti; Nadine Rouphael; Rafi Ahmed; Jens Wrammert; Mehul S Suthar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.432046,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.432046,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
6,A novel glucocorticoid and androgen receptor modulator reduces viral entry and innate immune inflammatory responses in the Syrian Hamster model of SARS-CoV-2,"Since its initial discovery in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID19, has spread worldwide and despite significant research efforts, treatment options remain limited. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung is associated with marked infiltration of macrophages and activation of innate immune inflammatory responses triggered, in part, by heightened production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that recruits lymphocytes to the site of infection that amplify tissue injury. Antagonists of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors have shown promise in experimental models of COVID19 and in clinical studies, because cell surface proteins required for viral entry, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), are transcriptionally regulated by these receptors. We therefore postulated that the glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, PT150, would reduce infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent inflammatory lung injury in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID19. Animals were infected intranasally with 2.5 x 10e4 TCID50/ml equivalents of SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/ 2020) and PT150 was administered by oral gavage at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day for a total of 7 days. Animals were then examined at days 3, 5 and 7 post-infection (DPI) for lung histopathology, viral load and production of proteins regulating the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results of these studies indicated that oral administration of PT150 decreased replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung, as well as expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein. Hypercellularity and inflammatory cell infiltration driven by macrophage responses were dramatically decreased in PT150-treated animals, as was tissue damage and expression of IL-6. Molecular modeling suggested that PT150 binds to the co-activator interface of the ligand binding domain of both AR and GR and thereby acts as an allosteric modulator and transcriptional repressor of these receptors. Phylogenetic analysis of AR and GR across multiple species permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a high degree of sequence identity maintained across species, including human, suggesting that the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy observed in Syrian hamsters would likely be predictive of positive outcomes in patients. PT150 is therefore a strong candidate for further clinical development for the treatment of COVID19 across variants of SARS-CoV-2.",Savannah M. Rocha; Anna C. Fagre; Amanda S. Latham; Katriana A.

7,Complete map of SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations that escape the monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555 and its cocktail with LY-CoV016,"Monoclonal antibodies and antibody cocktails are a promising therapeutic and prophylaxis for COVID-19. However, ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 can render monoclonal antibodies ineffective. Here we completely map all mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by a leading monoclonal antibody, LY-CoV555, and its cocktail combination with LY-CoV016. Individual mutations that escape binding by each antibody are combined in the circulating B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages (E484K escapes LY-CoV555, K417N/T escape LY-CoV016). Additionally, the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore, we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail. We suggest that future efforts should diversify the epitopes targeted by antibodies and antibody cocktails to make them more resilient to antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.",Tyler N Starr; Allison J Greaney; Adam S Dingens; Jesse D Bloom,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431683,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431683,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
8,Comparative Perturbation-Based Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding with Host Receptor and Neutralizing Antibodies : Structurally Adaptable Allosteric Communication Hotspots Define Spike Sites Targeted by Global Circulating Mutations,"In this study, we used an integrative computational approach focused on comparative perturbation-based modeling to examine molecular mechanisms and determine functional signatures underlying role of functional residues in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are targeted by novel mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations. Atomistic simulations and functional dynamics analysis are combined with alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity profiling for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with the ACE2 host receptor are REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail (REG10987+REG10933). Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity analysis, we have shown that K417, E484 and N501 residues correspond to key interacting centers with a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity that allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity with ACE2. Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with ACE2 we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417 and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major inter-molecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers to fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising activity of the spike protein.",Gennady Verkhivker; Steve Agajanian; Deniz Yazar Oztas; Grace Gupta,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432165,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432165,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False

10,Diagnostic accuracy of RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to a composite reference standard in hospitalized patients,"Background: COVID 19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV 2 has caused the greatest public health emergency of our time. Accurate laboratory detection of the virus is critical in order to contain the spread. Although real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the cornerstone of laboratory diagnosis, there have been conflicting reports on the diagnostic accuracy of this method. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on all hospitalized patients tested for SARS CoV 2 (at St. Pauls Hospital in Vancouver, BC) from March 13 to April 12, 2020. Diagnostic accuracy of initial PCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs was determined against a composite reference standard which included a clinical assessment of the likelihood of COVID 19 by medical experts, initial and repeat PCR, and post-hoc serological testing. Results: A total of 323 patients were included in the study, 33 (10.2%) tested positive and 290 (89.8%) tested negative by initial PCR. Patients testing positive were more likely to exhibit features of cough (66.7% vs 39.3%), shortness of breath (63.6% vs 35.9%), fever (72.7% vs 27.6%), radiographic findings (83.3% vs 39.6%) and severe outcomes including ICU admission (24.2% vs 9.7%) and mortality (21.2% vs 6.2%) compared to patients testing negative. Serology was performed on 90 patients and correlation between serology and PCR was 98.9%. There were 90 patients included in the composite reference standard. Compared to the composite reference standard, initial PCR had sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI 74.0 to 99.9%), specificity of 100% (95% CI 94.9 to 100%), positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI 81.5 to 100%) and a negative predictive value of 98.6% (95% CI 92.5 to 100%). Discussion: Our study showed high sensitivity of PCR on NP swab specimens when compared to composite reference standard in hospitalized patients. High correlation of PCR with serological testing further increased confidence in the diagnostic reliability of properly collected NP swabs.",Aleksandra Stefanovic; Noah Reich; Christopher F Lowe; David Puddicombe; Nancy Matic; Jesse Greiner; Janet Simons; Victor Leung; Terry Chu; Hiten Naik; Nick Myles; Laura Burns; Marc G Romney; Gordon Ritchie; Sylvie Champagne; Kent Dooley; Inna Sekirov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252016,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252016,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,True
11,Targeting the Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein through GSK-3 Inhibition,"The coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus infections express a nucleocapsid protein (N) that is essential for viral replication, transcription, and virion assembly. Phosphorylation of N from SARS-CoV by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is required for its function and inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium impairs N phosphorylation, viral transcription, and replication. Here we report that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains GSK-3 consensus sequences and that this motif is conserved in diverse coronaviruses, despite limited overall sequence conservation, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be sensitive to GSK-3 inhibitors including lithium. We conducted a retrospective analysis of lithium use in patients from three major health systems who were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2. We found that patients taking lithium have a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio = 0.51 [0.34 - 0.76], p = 0.001). We also show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by GSK-3. Knockout of GSK3A and GSK3B demonstrates that GSK-3 is essential for N phosphorylation. Alternative GSK-3 inhibitors block N phosphorylation and impair replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells in a cell-type dependent manner. Targeting GSK-3 may therefore provide a new approach to treat COVID-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks.",Xiaolei Liu; Anurag Verma; Holly Ramage; Gustavo Garcia; Rebecca L Myers; Anastasia Lucas; Jake J Michaelson; William Coryell; Arvind Kumar; Alexander Charney; Marcelo G.

A comprehensive attempt was made in this study to define a methodological approach for conducting WBE studies in the framework of identifying/selection of surveillance sites, standardizing sampling policy, designing sampling protocols to improve sensitivity, adopting safety protocol, and interpreting the data. The methodology was applied to a community and studied its epidemiological status with reference to occurrence, persistence, and variation of SARS-CoV-2 genome load in wastewater system to understand the prevalence of infection. Hourly and daily grab samples were analyzed and compared with the composite samples over a surveillance window of 7 days.

Univariate analysis was employed to compute vaccine hesitancy proportions and compare them across groups and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to compute the adjusted odds ratio. setting: Bangladesh participants: A total of 1134 participants from the general population, aged 18 years and above. outcome measures: Prevalence and predictors of vaccine hesitancy. results: 32.5% of participants showed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Hesitancy was high among respondents who were males, over age 60, unemployed, from low-income families, from central Bangladesh including Dhaka, living in rented houses, tobacco users, politically affiliated, participants who did not believe in the effectiveness of the vaccine for Bangladeshis and those who did not have any physical illnesses in the last year. In the multilevel logistic regression models, respondents who were transgender (AOR= 3.62), married (AOR=1.49), tobacco users (AOR=1.33), those who did not get any physical illnesses in the last year (AOR=1.49), those with political affiliations with opposition parties (AOR= 1.48), those who believed COVID-19 vaccines will not be effective for Bangladeshis (AOR= 3.20), and those who were slightly concerned (AOR = 2.87) or not concerned at all (AOR = 7.45) about themselves or a family member getting infected with COVID-19 in the next one year were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy (p < 0.05). conclusions: Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, it is important to promote evidence-based communication, mass media campaigns, and policy initiatives across Bangladesh to reduce vaccine hesitancy among the Bangladeshi population.",Mohammad Ali; Ahmed Hossain,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251917,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251917,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,True
14,Effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on Child and Staff COVID-19 Cases in US Summer Camps,"Background. Most camps remained closed during Summer 2020, due to concerns regarding child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and limited information about the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) within child congregate settings. Methods. We surveyed US camps about on-site operations, camper and staff demographics, COVID-19 cases amongst campers and staff, and NPI usage as related to pre-camp quarantines, facial coverings, physical distancing, cleaning, and facility modifications. For all NPIs, save quarantines, responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale format. Results. Within 486 on-site camps, a range of NPIs were instituted, most often related to reduced camper interactions, staff face coverings, cleaning, and hand hygiene. Camper facial coverings were less common, with campers always wearing masks at ~34% of the camps. Approximately 15% of camps reported 1+ confirmed COVID-19 case in either campers or staff, with three camps reporting a COVID outbreak. In both single and multi-NPI analyses, the risk of COVID-19 cases was lowest when campers always wore facial coverings. While less effective, constant use of staff facial coverings and targeted physical distancing measures, but not pre-camp quarantine, also reduced COVID-19 risks. Conclusions. We found constant facial coverings, especially for campers, and targeted physical distancing measures to reduce risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within summer camps. Our findings provide valuable guidance for future operations of camp and other child congregate settings with regard to efficient and effective NPI usage to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Helen H Suh; Laura Blaisdell; Julianne Meehan; Laurie Browne,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21250271,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21250271,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,True
15,"Nanoceutical Fabric Prevents COVID-19 Spread through Expelled Respiratory Droplets: A Combined Computational, Spectroscopic and Anti-microbial Study","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns the use of one-way valves or vents in free masks for potential threat of spreading COVID-19 through expelled respiratory droplets. Here, we have developed a nanoceutical cotton fabric duly sensitized with non-toxic zinc oxide nanomaterial for potential use as membrane filter in the one way valve for the ease of breathing without the threat of COVID-19 spreading. A detailed computational study revealed that zinc oxide nanoflowers (ZnO NF) with almost two-dimensional petals trap SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, responsible to attach to ACE-2 receptors in human lung epithelial cells. The study also confirm significant denaturation of the spike proteins on the ZnO surface, revealing removal of virus upon efficient trapping. Following the computational study, we have synthesized ZnO NF on cotton matrix using hydrothermal assisted strategy. Electron microscopic, steady-state and picosecond resolved spectroscopic studies confirm attachment of ZnO NF to the cotton (i.e., cellulose) matrix at atomic level to develop the nanoceutical fabric. A detailed antimicrobial assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria (model SARS-CoV-2 mimic) reveals excellent anti-microbial efficiency of the developed nanoceutical fabric. To our understanding the novel nanoceutical fabric used in one-way valve of a face mask would be the choice to assure breathing comfort along with source control of COVID-19 infection.

16,SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Spike variants bind human ACE2 with increased affinity,"SARS-CoV2 being highly infectious has been particularly effective in causing widespread infection globally and more variants of SARS-CoV2 are constantly being reported with increased genomic surveillance. In particular, the focus is on mutations of Spike protein, which binds human ACE2 protein enabling SARS-CoV2 entry and infection. Here we present a rapid experimental method leveraging the speed and flexibility of Mircoscale Thermophoresis (MST) to characterize the interaction between Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and human ACE2 protein. The B.1.351 variant harboring three mutations, (E484K, N501Y, and K417N) binds the ACE2 at nearly five-fold greater affinity than the original SARS-COV-2 RBD. We also find that the B.1.1.7 variant, binds two-fold more tightly to ACE2 than the SARS-COV-2 RBD.",Paul Khavari; Muthukumar Ramanathan; Ian D Ferguson; Weili Miao,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432359,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432359,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
17,Laser-facilitated epicutaneous immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces ACE2 blocking antibodies in mice,"The skin represents an attractive target tissue for vaccination against respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Laser-facilitated epicutaneous immunization (EPI) has been established as a novel technology to overcome the skin barrier, which combines efficient delivery via micropores with an inherent adjuvant effect due to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns. Here we delivered the S1 subunit of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to the skin of BALB/c mice via laser-generated micropores with or without CpG-ODN1826 or the B subunit of heat-labile enterotoxin of E.coli (LT-B). EPI induced serum IgG titers of 1:3200 that could be boosted 5 to 10-fold by co-administration of LT-B and CpG, respectively. Sera were able to inhibit binding of the spike protein to its receptor ACE2.

18,An Autoantigen Profile of Human A549 Lung Cells Reveals Viral and Host Etiologic Molecular Attributes of Autoimmunity in COVID-19,"We aim to establish a comprehensive COVID-19 autoantigen atlas in order to understand autoimmune diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination alterations by viral infection define major molecular changes in autoantigen origination. This study provides a large list of autoantigens as well as new targets for future investigation, e.g., UBA1, UCHL1, USP7, CDK11A, PRKDC, PLD3, PSAT1, RAB1A, SLC2A1, platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. This study illustrates how viral infection can modify host cellular proteins extensively, yield diverse autoantigens, and trigger a myriad of autoimmune sequelae.",Julia Y.

19,The interspecific fungal hybrid Verticillium longisporum displays sub-genome-specific gene expression,"Hybridization is an important evolutionary mechanism that can enable organisms to adapt to environmental challenges. It has previously been shown that the fungal allodiploid species Verticillium longisporum, causal agent of Verticillium stem striping in rape seed, has originated from at least three independent hybridization events between two haploid Verticillium species. To reveal the impact of genome duplication as a consequence of the hybridization, we studied the genome and transcriptome dynamics upon two independent V. longisporum hybridization events, represented by the hybrid lineages A1/D1 and A1/D3. We show that the V. longisporum genomes are characterized by extensive chromosomal rearrangements, including between parental chromosomal sets. V. longisporum hybrids display signs of evolutionary dynamics that are typically associated with the aftermath of allodiploidization, such as haploidization and a more relaxed gene evolution. Expression patterns of the two sub-genomes within the two hybrid lineages are more similar than those of the shared A1 parent between the two lineages, showing that expression patterns of the parental genomes homogenized within a lineage. However, as genes that display differential parental expression in planta do not typically display the same pattern in vitro, we conclude that sub-genome-specific responses occur in both lineages. Overall, our study uncovers the genomic and transcriptomic plasticity during evolution of the filamentous fungal hybrid V. longisporum and illustrate its adaptive potential.",Edurne Rujas; Iga Kucharska; Yong Zi Tan; Samir Benlekbir; Hong Cui; Tiantian Zhao; Gregory A Wasney; Patrick Budylowski; Furkan Guvenc; Jocelyn C Newton; Taylor Sicard; Anthony Semesi; Krithika Muthuraman; Amy Nouanesengsy; Katherine Prieto; Stephanie A Bueler; Sawsan Youssef; Sindy Liao-Chan; Jacob Glanville; Natasha Christie-Holmes; Samira Mubareka; Scott D Gray-Owen; John L Rubinstein; Bebhinn Treanor; Jean-Philippe Julien,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/341636,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/341636,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
20,"High-Throughput, Single-Copy Sequencing Reveals SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variants Coincident with Mounting Humoral Immunity during Acute COVID-19","Tracking evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within infected individuals will help elucidate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and inform use of antiviral interventions. In this study, we developed an approach for sequencing the region encoding the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface proteins from large numbers of individual virus RNA genomes per sample. We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged in vitro and to upper respiratory samples from 7 study participants with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cell culture were diverse, including 18 haplotypes with non-synonymous mutations clustered in the spike NH2-terminal domain (NTD) and furin cleavage site regions. By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of mutations. However, longitudinal analysis in one individual revealed 4 virus haplotypes bearing 3 independent mutations in a spike NTD epitope targeted by autologous antibodies. These mutations arose coincident with a 6.2-fold rise in serum binding to spike and a transient increase in virus burden. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a capacity for rapid genetic adaptation that becomes detectable in vivo with the onset of humoral immunity, with the potential to contribute to delayed virologic clearance in the acute setting.",Sung Hee Ko; Elham Bayat Mokhtari; Prakriti Mudvari; Sydney Stein; Christopher D Stringham; Danielle Wagner; Sabrina Ramelli; Marcos J Ramirez-Benitez; Jeffrey R Strich; Richard T Davey Jr.; Tongqing Zhou; John Misasi; Peter D Kwong; Daniel S Chertow; Nancy J Sullivan; Eli A Boritz,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432184,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.432184,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
21,Acquisition of the L452R mutation in the ACE2-binding interface of Spike protein triggers recent massive expansion of SARS-Cov-2 variants,"The recent rise in mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially with changes in the Spike protein, is of significant concern due to the potential ability for these mutations to increase viral infectivity, virulence and/or ability to escape protective antibodies. Here, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently. The newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 -February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies. If true, this in turn might lead to significantly increased infectivity of the L452R variants, warranting their close surveillance and in-depth functional studies.",Veronika Tchesnokova; Hemantha Kulakesara; Lydia Larson; Victoria Bowers; Elena Rechkina; Dagmara Kisiela; Yulia Sledneva; Debarati Choudhury; Iryna Maslova; Kai Deng; Kirthi Kutumbaka; Hao Geng; Curtis Fowler; James D.

22,Reanalysis of deep-sequencing data from Austria points towards a small SARS-COV-2 transmission bottleneck on the order of one to three virions,"An early analysis of SARS-CoV-2 deep-sequencing data that combined epidemiological and genetic data to characterize the transmission dynamics of the virus in and beyond Austria concluded that the size of the virus's transmission bottleneck was large, on the order of 1000 virions. We performed new computational analyses using these deep-sequenced samples from Austria. Our analyses included characterization of transmission bottleneck sizes across a range of variant calling thresholds and examination of patterns of shared low-frequency variants between transmission pairs in cases where de novo genetic variation was present in the recipient. From these analyses, among others, we found that SARS-CoV-2 transmission bottlenecks are instead likely to be very tight, on the order of 1 to 3 virions. These findings have important consequences for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 evolves between hosts and the processes shaping genetic variation observed at the population level.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432096,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432096,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
23,Experimental evidence for enhanced receptor binding by rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Rapidly spreading new variants of SARS-CoV-2 carry multiple mutations in the viral spike protein which attaches to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells. Among these mutations are amino acid changes N501Y (lineage B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK), and the combination N501Y, E484K, K417N (B.1.351, first identified in South Africa), all located at the interface on the receptor binding domain (RBD). We experimentally establish that RBD containing the N501Y mutation results in 9-fold stronger binding to the hACE2 receptor than wild type RBD. The E484K mutation does not significantly influence the affinity for the receptor, while K417N attenuates affinity. As a result, RBD from B.1.351 containing all three mutations binds 3-fold stronger to hACE2 than wild type RBD but 3-fold weaker than N501Y. The recently emerging double mutant E484K/N501Y binds as tight as N501Y. The independent evolution of lineages containing mutations with different effects on receptor binding affinity, viral transmission and immune evasion underscores the importance of global viral genome surveillance and functional characterization.",Charlie Laffeber; Kelly de Koning; Roland Kanaar; Joyce Lebbink,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432357,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432357,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False
24,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and its individual differences with ACE2-expressing human iPS cells,"Genetic differences are a primary reason for differences in the susceptibility and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells maintain the genetic information of the donor, they can be used to model individual differences in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in vitro. Notably, undifferentiated human iPS cells themselves cannot be infected bySARS-CoV-2. Using adenovirus vectors, here we found that human iPS cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (ACE2-iPS cells) can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In infected ACE2-iPS cells, the expression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, the budding of viral particles, the production of progeny virus, double membrane spherules, and double-membrane vesicles were confirmed. We also evaluated COVID-19 therapeutic drugs in ACE2-iPS cells and confirmed the strong antiviral effects of Remdesivir, EIDD-2801, and interferon-beta. In addition, we performed SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments on ACE2-iPS/ES cells from 8 individuals. Male iPS/ES cells were more capable of producing the virus as compared with female iPS/ES cells. These findings suggest that ACE2-iPS cells can not only reproduce individual differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, but they are also a useful resource to clarify the causes of individual differences in COVID-19 due to genetic differences.",Emi Sano; Ayaka Sakamoto; Natsumi Mimura; Ai Hirabayashi; Yukiko Muramoto; Takeshi Noda; Takuya Yamamoto; Kazuo Takayama,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432218,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.432218,2021-02-22,2021-02-22,,False

In addition, pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of these eight polyphenols were calculated according to the SwissADME tool. Binding energy constant of pinocembrin was found the highest for both receptors, followed by chrysin, CAPE and hesperetin. In silico ADME behavior of the eight polyphenol was found potential ability to work effectively as novel drugs.

26,A cannabinoid receptor agonist shows anti-inflammatory and survival properties in human SARS-CoV-2-infected iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can infect several organs and lead to loss of vital organ function, especially impacting respiratory capacity. Among the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 is myocardial injury, caused both directly and indirectly by SARS-CoV-2, and which is associated with a high risk of mortality. One of the hallmarks of severe COVID-19 is the ""cytokine storm"", at which point the immune system malfunctions, leading to possible organ failure and death. Cannabinoids are known to have anti-inflammatory properties by negatively modulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Herein, we investigated the effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) on SARS-CoV-2-infected human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Although WIN did not modulate angiotensin-converting enzyme II, nor reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in hiPSC-CMs at the conditions tested, it had anti-inflammatory and protective effects by reducing the levels of interleukins 6, 8,18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in these cells without causing hypertrophic cardiac damage. These findings suggest that cannabinoids should be further investigated as an alternative therapeutic tool for the treatment of COVID-19.

27,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cardiomyocytes by targeting the Sigma-1 receptor disrupts cytoskeleton architecture and contractility,"Heart dysfunction, represented by conditions such as myocarditis and arrhythmia, has been reported in COVID-19 patients. Therapeutic strategies focused on the cardiovascular system, however, remain scarce. The Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) has been recently proposed as a therapeutic target because its inhibition reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication. To investigate the role of S1R in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, we used human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CM) as an experimental model. Here we show that the S1R antagonist NE-100 decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication in hiPSC-CMs. Also, NE-100 reduces cytokine release and cell death associated with infection. Because S1R is involved in cardiac physiology, we investigated the effects of NE-100 in cardiomyocyte morphology and function. We show that NE-100 compromises cytoskeleton integrity and reduces beating frequency, causing contractile impairment. These results show that targeting S1R to challenge SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a useful therapeutic strategy but its detrimental effects in vivo on cardiac function should not be ignored.",José Alexandre Salerno; Thayana Torquato; Jairo R Temerozo; Livia Goto-Silva; Mayara A.

29,"Predicting mortality, duration of treatment, pulmonary embolism and required ceiling of ventilatory support for COVID-19 inpatients: A Machine-Learning Approach","IntroductionWithin the UK, COVID-19 has contributed towards over 103,000 deaths. Multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified including various demographics, co-morbidities, biochemical parameters, and physical assessment findings. However, using this vast data to improve clinical care has proven challenging.

Aimsto develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, to aid risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making.

MethodsAnonymized data regarding 44 independent predictor variables of 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case-controlled analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, level of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy required, and duration of inpatient treatment. Secondary pulmonary embolism was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were created using Bayesian Networks, and cross-validated.

ResultsOur multivariable models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of inpatient mortality (F1 score 83.7%, PPV 82%, NPV 67.9%); level of ventilatory support required (F1 score varies from 55.8% ""High-flow Oxygen level"" to 71.5% ""ITU-Admission level""); duration of inpatient treatment (varies from 46.7% for ""[&ge;] 2 days but < 3 days"" to 69.8% ""[&le;] 1 day""); and risk of pulmonary embolism sequelae (F1 score 85.8%, PPV of 83.7%, and NPV of 80.9%).

ConclusionOverall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable predictive models for 4 outcomes, that utilize readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as clinical decision-making tools.

30,Evaluation of rapid antibody test and chest computed tomography results of COVID-19 patients: A retrospective study,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread around the world. Therefore, rapid, simpler, and more accurate diagnostic tests are urgently needed to diagnose the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 IgM/ IgG rapid antibody test results in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and their chest computed tomography (CT) data.

MethodsA total of 320 patients admitted to our hospital for different durations due to COVID-19 were included in the study. Serum samples were obtained within 0 to 7 days from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR and chest CT scan. According to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, the patients included in the study were divided into two groups: PCR positive group (n=46), and PCR negative group (n=274).

ResultsOf the 320 COVID-19 serum samples, IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG were detected in 9.4%, 3.1%, and 17.8% within one week respectively. IgG/IgM antibodies were not detected in 69.7% of the patients. In the study, it was determined that 249 (77.8%) of 320 patients had positive chest CT scans. Four (5.6%) of 100 patients with negative chest CT scan had IgM positive and 2 (2.8%) had both IgM/ IgG positive. IgM was detected in 23 (9.2%), IgG in 1 (0.4%) and IgM/IgG in 35 (14%) of chest CT scan positive patients. The rate of CT findings in patients with antibody positivity (n=97) was found to be significantly higher than those with antibody negativity.

ConclusionsThe results of the present study show the accurate and equivalent performance of serological antibody assays and chest CT in detecting SARS-CoV-2 0 to 7 days from the onset of COVID19 symptoms. When the RT-PCR is not available, we believe that the combination of immunochromatographic test and chest CT scan can increase diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.",Ali Ozturk; Taylan Bozok; Tugce Simsek Bozok,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251772,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251772,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
31,Impaired local intrinsic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe COVID-19,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can lead to severe lower respiratory illness including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can result in profound morbidity and mortality. However, many infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have isolated upper respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the upper airways represent the initial site of viral infection, and that some individuals are able to largely constrain viral pathology to the nasal and oropharyngeal tissues. Which cell types in the human nasopharynx are the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how infection influences the cellular organization of the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. Here, we present nasopharyngeal samples from a cohort of 35 individuals with COVID-19, representing a wide spectrum of disease states from ambulatory to critically ill, as well as 23 healthy and intubated patients without COVID-19. Using standard nasopharyngeal swabs, we collected viable cells and performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), simultaneously profiling both host and viral RNA. We find that following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the upper respiratory epithelium undergoes massive reorganization: secretory cells diversify and expand, and mature epithelial cells are preferentially lost. Further, we observe evidence for deuterosomal cell and immature ciliated cell expansion, potentially representing active repopulation of lost ciliated cells through coupled secretory cell differentiation. Epithelial cells from participants with mild/moderate COVID-19 show extensive induction of genes associated with anti-viral and type I interferon responses. In contrast, cells from participants with severe lower respiratory symptoms appear globally muted in their anti-viral capacity, despite substantially higher local inflammatory myeloid populations and equivalent nasal viral loads. This suggests an essential role for intrinsic, local epithelial immunity in curbing and constraining viral-induced pathology. Using a custom computational pipeline, we characterized cell-associated SARS-CoV-2 RNA and identified rare cells with RNA intermediates strongly suggestive of active replication. Both within and across individuals, we find remarkable diversity and heterogeneity among SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ host cells, including developing/immature and interferon-responsive ciliated cells, KRT13+ ""hillock""-like cells, and unique subsets of secretory, goblet, and squamous cells. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, as compared to uninfected bystanders, are enriched for genes involved in susceptibility (e.g., CTSL, TMPRSS2) or response (e.g., MX1, IFITM3, EIF2AK2) to infection. Together, this work defines both protective and detrimental host responses to SARS-CoV-2, determines the direct viral targets of infection, and suggests that failed anti-viral epithelial immunity in the nasal mucosa may underlie the progression to severe COVID-19.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.431155,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.431155,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,False
32,Association between Psychotropic Medications Functionally Inhibiting Acid Sphingomyelinase and reduced risk of Intubation or Death among Individuals with Mental Disorder and Severe COVID-19: an Observational Study,"Prior preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)/ceramide system may provide a useful framework for better understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and the repurposing of psychotropic medications with functional inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase, called FIASMA psychotropic medications, against COVID-19. We examined the potential usefulness of FIASMA psychotropic medication use among patients with mental disorder hospitalized for severe COVID-19, in an observational multicenter retrospective study conducted at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 545 adult patients with mental disorder hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 164 (30.1%) received a psychotropic FIASMA medication at study baseline, which was defined as the date of hospital admission for COVID-19. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received a psychotropic FIASMA medication at baseline and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric and other medical comorbidity, and psychotropic and other medications. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW). There was a significant association between FIASMA psychotropic medication use at baseline and reduced risk of intubation or death both in the crude analysis (HR=0.42; 95%CI=0.31-0.57; p<0.01) and in the primary IPW analysis (HR=0.50; 95%CI=0.37-0.67; p<0.01). This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses. Exploratory analyses suggested that this association was not specific to one FIASMA psychotropic class or medication. These results suggest the usefulness of the ASM/ceramide system framework in COVID-19.

33,Statewide Impact of COVID-19 on Social Determinants of Health - A First Look: Findings from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin,"There is an urgent need to track the early and ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health from local to global scales. At the same time, there is an overall lack of U.S. state-specific surveillance data tracking social determinants of health (SDOH) and associations with population well-being, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic in populations. Statewide data can offer important insights into how SDOH shape the long-term effects of COVID-19 in the population since implementation of many policies and programs varied widely early on in the pandemic. In May of 2020, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) program launched a statewide online/phone survey of early and ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on health and well-being across diverse communities and families. The goal of this study is to provide descriptive data including perceived COVID-19 risks, access to and results of COVID-19 antigen testing, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic on health and mental health in populations. Key findings include higher rates of testing and perceived past infection from COVID-19 among non-white respondents. Higher economic shifts and job changes in female vs male respondents. Families with children reported overall higher levels of stress, and stress from the pandemic. There were urban and rural differences in changes to access to care. Rural regions, which had a lower prevalence of infections early in the pandemic as compared to urban areas, also reported fewer delays or missed appointments due to COVID-19. Key findings show that SDOH are shaping impacts of health and well-being early on in the pandemic and future longitudinal follow-up will be important to shape policies and programs well into the future.",Kristen MC Malecki; Amy A Schultz; Maria Nikodemova; Matthew C Walsh; Andrew J.

34,KLF2 is a therapeutic target for COVID-19 induced endothelial dysfunction,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is regarded as an endothelial disease (endothelialitis) with its mechanism being incompletely understood. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that the endothelium represents the Achilles heel in COVID-19 patients and that endothelial dysfunction precipitates COVID-19 and accompanying multi-organ injuries. Thus, pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential to ameliorate COVID-19 and its cardiovascular complications. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were treated with serum from control subjects or COVID-19 patients. Downstream monocyte adhesion and associated gene/protein expression was evaluated in endothelial cells exposed to COVID-19 patient serum in the presence of KLF2 activator (Atorvastatin) or KLF2 overexpression by an adenoviral vector. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of KLF2 was significantly reduced and monocyte adhesion was increased in endothelial cells treated with COVID-19 patient serum due to elevated levels of pro-adhesive molecules, ICAM1 and VCAM1. IL-1{beta} and TNF-, two cytokines observed in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients, decreased KLF2 gene expression. Next-generation RNA-sequencing data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to a cardiovascular protective transcriptome associated with improved endothelial function (vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant status, anti-thrombosis/-coagulation, anti-fibrosis and reduced angiogenesis). Treatment of HPMECs with atorvastatin or KLF2 adenovirus ameliorate COVID-19 serum-induced increase in endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion by increasing KLF2 expression. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that genetic and pharmacological activation of KLF2 represses COVID-19 associated endothelial dysfunction, heralding a potentially new direction to treat endothelialitis accompanying COVID-19.

35,Persisting adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in Lower Austria,"The prevalence and persistence of adaptive immunity responses following a SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into potential population immunity. Adaptive immune responses comprise of antibody-based responses as well as T cell responses mainly addressing viruses and virus-infected human cells, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of both types of adaptive immunity is essential to follow population-based SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. In this study, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell activities in patients who recovered from a COVID-19 infection in spring and autumn 2020. Here we observed a robust and stable SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune response in both groups with persisting IgA and IgG levels as well as stable T cell activity. Moreover, there was a positive correlation of a lasting immune response with the severity of disease. Our data give evidence for a persisting adaptive immune memory, which suggest a continuing immunity for more than six months post infection.",Dennis Ladage; Oliver Harzer; Peter Engel; Hannes Winkler; Ralf Braun,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251551,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251551,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
36,Profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell response: Relationship with disease severity and impact of HIV-1 and active Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-infection,"T cells are involved in control of COVID-19, but limited knowledge is available on the relationship between antigen-specific T cell response and disease severity. Here, we assessed the magnitude, function and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells in 95 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (38 of them being HIV-1 and/or tuberculosis (TB) co-infected) and 38 non-COVID-19 patients, using flow cytometry. We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, associates with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB co-infection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response. HIV-1 mediated CD4 T cell depletion associated with suboptimal T cell and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2; and a decrease in the polyfunctional capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells was observed in COVID-19 patients with active TB. Our results also revealed that COVID-19 patients displayed reduced frequency of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, with possible implications for TB disease progression. There results corroborate the important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis and support the concept of altered T cell functions in patients with severe disease.",Catherine Riou; Elsa du Bruyn; Cari Stek; Remy Daroowala; Rene T Goliath; Fatima Abrahams; Qonita Said-Hartley; Brian W Allowed; Marvin Hsiao; Katalin A Wilkinson; Cecilia S Lindestam Arlehamn; Alessandro Sette; Sean Wasserman; Robert J Wilkinson; - the HIATUS consortium,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251838,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251838,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
37,Applicability of Neighborhood and Building Scale Wastewater-Based Genomic Epidemiology to Track the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and other Pathogens.,"The benefits of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for tracking the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, have become apparent since the start of the pandemic. However, most sampling occurs at the wastewater treatment plant influent and therefore can only monitor SARS-CoV-2 concentration and spread within the entire catchment, which can encompass multiple municipalities. Furthermore, most WBE only quantifies the virus, and therefore miss crucial information that can be gained by sequencing SARS-CoV-2. Here we demonstrate feasibility of sampling at the neighborhood or building complex level using a mix of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and targeted sequencing to provide a more refined understanding of the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strains. When coupled with the higher-level treatment plant samples, this creates an opportunity for health officials to monitor the spread of the virus at different spatial and temporal scales to inform policy decisions.

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the neighborhood, hospital, and nursing home level with the ability to detect one COVID-19 positive out of 60 nursing home residents. The viral load obtained was correlative with the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in the hospital. Sequencing of the samples over time demonstrated that nonsynonymous mutations fluctuate in the viral population, and wastewater-based sequencing could be an efficient approach to monitor for vaccine or convalescent plasma escape mutants, as well as mutations that could reduce the efficacy of diagnostics. Furthermore, while SARS-CoV-2 was detected by untargeted RNA sequencing, qPCR and targeted whole genome amplicon sequencing were more reliable methods for tracking the pandemic. From our sequencing data, clades and shifts in mutation profiles within the community were traceable and could be used to determine if vaccine or diagnostics need to be adapted to ensure continued efficacy.

38,Estimates of the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Ukraine based on two data sets,"BackgroundTo simulate how the number of COVID-19 cases increases versus time, various data sets for the number of new cases and different mathematical models can be used. Since there are some differences in statistical data, the results of simulations can be different. Complex mathematical models contain many unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations of the disease over time. Even long-term monitoring of the epidemic may not provide reliable estimates of its parameters due to the constant change of testing conditions, isolation of infected and quarantine. Therefore, simpler approaches are necessary. In particular, previous simulations of the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Ukraine were based on smoothing of the dependence of the number of cases on time and the generalized SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. These approaches allowed to detect the waves of pandemic and to make adequate predictions of the their duration and final sizes. In particular, eight waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine were investigated.

ObjectiveWe will compare the results simulation of a new epidemic wave in Ukraine based on national statistics and data reported by Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

MethodsIn this study we use the smoothing method for the dependences of the number of cases on time, the generalized SIR model for the dynamics of any epidemic wave, the exact solution of the linear differential equations, and statistical approach developed before.

ResultsNinth epidemic wave in Ukraine was simulated. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were calculated and compared with the use of two data sets. Both predictions are not very optimistic: new cases will not stop appearing until June-July 2021.

ConclusionsNew waves of COVID-19 pandemic can be detected, calculated and predicted with the use of rather simple mathematical models. The results of calculations depend on the data sets for the number of confirmed cases. The expected long duration of the pandemic forces us to be careful and in solidarity. The government and all Ukrainians must strictly adhere to quarantine measures in order to avoid fatal consequences. Probably the presented results could be useful in order to estimate the efficiency of future vaccinations.",Igor Nesteruk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252000,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252000,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True

40,Early Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Emergence in the DoD via Retrospective Analysis of 2019-2020 Upper Respiratory Illness Samples,"The first case of non-travel related SARS-COV-2 was detected late February 2020 in California, however the delay of diagnostic testing and initial stringent testing criteria made it difficult to identify those who could have acquired it through community spread. There was speculation by many that the virus may have been circulating at least a month earlier [1], and environmental sampling has suggested that versions of this virus were found many months before the first human samples were identified [2]. Here we performed a retrospective study from residual samples collected from a global DoD Respiratory Surveillance Program to establish a tentative timeline by which this virus was circulating in our DoD population. We performed RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2 and compared to the dates of these cases to the first cases identified in respective states and counties using the Johns Hopkins COVID tracker website. Twenty-four positive samples were identified out of approximately 7,000 tested. Although we found some early cases in certain regions, we did not see circulation before late February in samples collected both in the US and outside the USA.

SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this topic?C_ST_ABSWe know that the first reported case of SARS-COV-2 was mid-January; however, there has been conjecture that the virus was found in the community before this date.

What is added by this report?Here we took samples collection from a global respiratory surveillance program and evaluated for the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA. The first case we found in the surveillance program was approximately 30-60 days before the first case was identified on military installations via diagnostic testing, however was not earlier than the mid-January reported case in California.

42,Reported COVID-19 Incidence in Wisconsin High School Athletes During Fall 2020,"IntroductionThe purpose of this study was to describe the reported incidence of COVID-19 in Wisconsin high school athletes in September 2020, and to investigate the relationship of COVID-19 incidence with sport and face mask use.

MethodsSurveys were sent to athletic directors of all Wisconsin high schools regarding sports during September 2020. The association between reported case rates in athletes in each county and the county general population were evaluated with a weighted linear model. Multivariable negative binomial regression models evaluated the associations between COVID-19 incidence and sport type and face mask use by players, adjusting for the county COVID-19 incidence for each school.

Results207 schools that had reinitiated sport reported 270 COVID-19 cases among 30,074 players, for case and incidence rates of 809 cases per 100,000 players and 32.6 cases per 100,000 player-days, respectively. The case rates for athletes in each county were positively correlated with the case rates for the countys general population ({beta} =1.14{+/-}0.20, r=0.60, p<0.001). One hundred fifteen (55%) of cases were attributed to household contact, 85 (41%) to contact outside sport or school, 5 (2.4%) to school contact, and 1 (0.5%) to sport contact. No difference was identified between team and individual sports (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.03 [95% CI=0.49-2.2], p=0.93) or between non-contact and contact sports (IRR=0.53 [0.23-1.3], p=0.14), although the difference between outdoor and indoor sports approached statistical significance (IRR=0.52 [0.26-1.1], p=0.07). 84% of schools required face masks while playing. For those sports with >50 participating schools, there were no significant associations between COVID-19 incidence and face mask use in cross country (IRR=0.71 [0.2-2.2], p=0.52), football (IRR=1.6 [0.6-5.1], p=0.404), boys soccer (IRR=2.3 [0.5-17], p=0.31), or girls volleyball (IRR=1.4 [0.3-6.6], p=0.64).

ConclusionsIncidence of reported COVID-19 among athletes was related to background county incidence and most cases were attributed to household and community contact. Although not statistically significant, reported COVID-19 incidence may be lower in outdoor sports. Face mask use did not have a significant benefit, which may be due to relatively low rates of COVID-19 and the small number of schools that did not report using face masks.",Phillip Sasser; Timothy McGuine; Kristin Haraldsdottir; Kevin Biese; Leslie Goodavish; Bethany Stevens; Andrew Watson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251986,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251986,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
43,Mortality after surgery with SARS-CoV-2 infection in England: A population-wide epidemiological study,"ObjectivesTo confirm the incidence of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated mortality after surgery.

Design and settingAnalysis of routine electronic health record data from National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England.

MethodsWe extracted data from Hospital Episode Statistics in England describing adult patients undergoing surgery between 1st January 2020 and 31st October 2020. The exposure was SARS-CoV-2 infection defined by ICD-10 codes. The primary outcome measure was 90-day in-hospital mortality. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, Charlson co-morbidity index, index of multiple deprivation, presence of cancer, surgical procedure type and admission acuity. Results are presented as n (%) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.

ResultsWe identified 1,972,153 patients undergoing surgery of whom 11,940 (0.6%) had SARS-CoV-2. In total, 19,100 (1.0%) patients died in hospital. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a much greater risk of death (SARS-CoV-2: 2,618/11,940 [21.9%] vs No SARS-CoV-2: 16,482/1,960,213 [0.8%]; OR: 5.8 [5.5 - 6.1]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing elective surgery 1,030/1,374,985 (0.1%) had SARS-CoV-2 of whom 83/1,030 (8.1%) died, compared with 1,092/1,373,955 (0.1%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 29.0 [22.5 -37.3]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing emergency surgery 9,742/437,891 (2.2%) patients had SARS-CoV-2, of whom 2,466/9,742 (25.3%) died compared with 14,817/428,149 (3.5%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 5.7 [5.4 - 6.0]; p<0.001).

ConclusionsThe low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHS surgical pathways suggests current infection prevention and control policies are highly effective. However, the high mortality amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2 suggests these precautions cannot be safely relaxed.

However, transfusion-transmitted disease is a risk, particularly in regions with high endemic prevalence of transfusion-transmissible diseases. Pathogen reduction can mitigate this risk; thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R+UV) pathogen reduction technology on the functional properties of CCP.

Materials and MethodsCCP units (n = 6) from recovered COVID-19 research donors were treated with R+UV. Pre- and post-treatment samples were tested for coagulation factor and immunoglobulin retention. Antibody binding to spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), S1, and S2 epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by ELISA.

Neutralizing antibody (nAb) function was assessed by pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).

ResultsMean retention of coagulation factors was [&ge;] 70% while retention of immunoglobulins was 100%. Starting nAb titers were low, but PRNT50 titers did not differ between pre- and post-treatment samples. No statistically significant differences were detected in levels of IgG (P [&ge;] 0.3665) and IgM (P [&ge;] 0.1208) antibodies to RBD, S1, and S2 proteins before and after treatment.

45,"Rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during the 2020 pandemic year in the population of the city of Tirana, Albania","IntroductionWhile the identification of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been used to measure the hidden circulation of the COVID-19 in communities, there are few publications on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during both waves of 2020. This study provides original data about the change in proportion of individuals showing immune response to COVID-19 between beginning of July and end of December 2020.

MethodsThe study was conducted in two rounds, 27 June -3 July, and 21-28 December 2020, using two independently selected samples of individuals 20-70 years old. Study participants were randomly selected from lists of the inhabitants of the catchment communities of four primary health care centers in Tirana City. Serological testing was performed by an ELISA method which determines IgG class antibodies anti S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The validity of the method was tested in a sample of blood donors sera of 2018.

ResultsThe proportion of individuals classified as seropositive during the first round, in early July was 7.5% (95% CI: 4.3% -10.7%). The proportion rose sharply in the second round, by late December 2020, reaching 48.2% (95% CI: 44.8% -51.7%). The same increasing pattern was observed in all studied categories. No statistical significance was found between men and women and between age categories. The prevalence of seropositive individuals was always significantly higher among those who reported symptoms and those who had done the molecular test.

ConclusionThe ratio of total infected cases over confirmed cases was estimated to be higher than 10 to 1 in Albania. The rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence observed in Tirana City may have been facilitated by a number of factors, including the very low infection exposure during the period March -May 2020, and the consecutive high susceptibility in population. Despite the observed high seroprevalence, one month after the study, COVID-19 incidence continued to increase in Tirana.",Genc Sulcebe; Alban Ylli; Fabian Cenko; Margarita Kurti-Prifti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251776,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251776,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
46,Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test (ALERT) for detecting SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted bottlenecks in large-scale, frequent testing of populations for infections. PCR-based diagnostic tests are expensive, reliant on expensive centralized labs, can take days to deliver results, and are prone to backlogs and supply shortages. Antigen tests, that bind and detect the surface proteins of a virus, are rapid and inexpensive but suffer from high false negative rates. To address this problem, we have created an inexpensive, simple, and robust 60-minute Do-It-Yourself (DIY) workflow to detect viral RNA from nasal swabs or saliva with high sensitivity (0.1 to 2 viral particles/{micro}l) and specificity (>97% True Negative Rate) utilizing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP).

Our workflow, ALERT (Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test), incorporates the following features: 1) Increased shelf-life and ambient temperature storage by using wax layers to isolate enzymes from reaction, 2) Improved specificity by using sequence-specific QUASR reporters, 3) Increased sensitivity through use of a magnetic wand to enable pipette-free concentration of sample RNA and cell debris removal, 4) Quality control with a nasopharyngeal-specific mRNA target, and 5) Co-detection of other respiratory viruses, such as Influenza B, by duplexing QUASR-modified RT-LAMP primer sets.

The flexible nature of the ALERT workflow allows easy, at-home and point-of-care testing for individuals and higher-throughput processing for centralized labs and hospitals. With minimal effort, SARS-CoV-2-specific primer sets can be swapped out for other targets to repurpose ALERT to detect other viruses, microorganisms or nucleic acid-based markers.",Ali Bektaş; Mike F.

47,A Multivariate Forecasting Model for the COVID-19 Hospital Census Based on Local Infection Incidence,"COVID-19 has been one of the most serious global health crises in world history. During the pandemic, healthcare systems require accurate forecasts for key resources to guide preparation for patient surges. Fore-casting the COVID-19 hospital census is among the most important planning decisions to ensure adequate staffing, number of beds, intensive care units, and vital equipment. In the literature, only a few papers have approached this problem from a multivariate time-series approach incorporating leading indicators for the hospital census. In this paper, we propose to use a leading indicator, the local COVID-19 infection incidence, together with the COVID-19 hospital census in a multivariate framework using a Vector Error Correction model (VECM) and aim to forecast the COVID-19 hospital census for the next 7 days. The model is also applied to produce scenario-based 60-day forecasts based on different trajectories of the pandemic. With several hypothesis tests and model diagnostics, we confirm that the two time-series have a cointegration relationship, which serves as an important predictor. Other diagnostics demonstrate the goodness-of-fit of the model. Using time-series cross-validation, we can estimate the out-of-sample Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The model has a median MAPE of 5.9%, which is lower than the 6.6% median MAPE from a univariate Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. In the application of scenario-based long-term forecasting, future census exhibits concave trajectories with peaks lagging 2-3 weeks later than the peak infection incidence. Our findings show that the local COVID-19 infection incidence can be successfully in-corporated into a VECM with the COVID-19 hospital census to improve upon existing forecast models, and to deliver accurate short-term forecasts and realistic scenario-based long-term trajectories to help healthcare systems leaders in their decision making.

Author summaryDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems need to have adequate resources to accommodate demand from COVID-19 cases. One of the most important metrics for planning is the COVID-19 hospital census. Only a few papers make use of leading indicators within multivariate time-series models for this problem. We incorporated a leading indicator, the local COVID-19 infection incidence, together with the COVID-19 hospital census in a multivariate framework called the Vector Error Correction model to make 7-day-ahead forecasts. This model is also applied to produce 60-day scenario forecasts based on different trajectories of the pandemic. We find that the two time-series have a stable long-run relationship. The model has a good fit to the data and good forecast performance in comparison with a more traditional model using the census data alone. When applied to different 60-day scenarios of the pandemic, the census forecasts show concave trajectories that peak 2-3 weeks later than the infection incidence. Our paper presents this new model for accurate short-term forecasts and realistic scenario-based long-term forecasts of the COVID-19 hospital census to help healthcare systems in their decision making. Our findings suggest using the local COVID-19 infection incidence data can improve and extend more traditional forecasting models.",Hieu Minh Nguyen; Philip Turk; Andrew McWilliams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251243,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251243,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
48,Association between benzodiazepine receptor agonist use and increased mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19: results from an observational study,"ObjectiveTo examine the association between benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BZRA) use and mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted an observational multicenter retrospective cohort study at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. The sample involved 14,381 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19. 686 (4.8%) inpatients received a BZRA within at the time of hospital admission at a mean daily diazepam-equivalent dose of 19.7 mg (SD=25.4). The study baseline was the date of hospital admission and the primary endpoint was death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received BZRAs and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, obesity and comorbidity) and other medications. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW).

ResultsOver a mean follow-up of 14.5 days (SD=18.1), the primary endpoint occurred in 186 patients (27.1%) who received a BZRA and in 1,134 patients (8.3%) who did not. There was a significant association between BZRA use and increased mortality both in the crude analysis (HR=3.20; 95% CI=2.74-3.74; p<0.01) and in the primary IPW analysis (HR=1.61; 95% CI=1.31-1.98, p<0.01), with a significant dose-dependent relationship (HR=1.55; 95% CI=1.08-2.22; p=0.02). This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses.

ConclusionsBZRA use was associated with increased mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with a dose-dependent relationship, suggesting a potential benefit of decreasing dose or tapering off these medications when possible in these patients.",Nicolas Hoertel; Marina Sánchez-Rico; Erich Gulbins; Johannes Kornhuber; Raphaël Vernet; Nathanaël Beeker; Antoine Neuraz; Carlos Blanco; Mark Olfson; Guillaume Airagnes; Cédric Lemogne; Jesús M Alvarado; Michel Arnaout; Pierre Meneton; Frédéric Limosin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252004,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21252004,2021-02-20,2021-02-20,,True
49,Delivery of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein into human cells,"SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (S2-E) is a conserved membrane protein that is essential to coronavirus assembly and budding. Here, we describe the recombinant expression and purification of S2-E into amphipol-class amphipathic polymer solutions. The physical properties of amphipols underpin their ability to solubilize and stabilize membrane proteins without disrupting membranes. Amphipol delivery of S2-E to pre-formed planar bilayers results in spontaneous membrane integration and formation of viroporin ion channels. Amphipol delivery of the S2-E protein to human cells results in membrane integration followed by retrograde trafficking to a location adjacent to the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi, which are the sites of coronavirus replication. Delivery of S2-E to cells enables both chemical biological approaches for future studies of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and development of ""Trojan Horse"" anti-viral therapies.

50,Probing the SAM Binding Site of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 in vitro Using SAM Competitive Inhibitors Guides Developing Selective bi-substrate Inhibitors,"The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly brought the healthcare systems world-wide to a breaking point along with devastating socioeconomic consequences. The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the disease uses RNA capping to evade the human immune system. Non-structural protein (nsp) 14 is one of the 16 nsps in SARS-CoV-2 and catalyzes the methylation of the viral RNA at N7-guanosine in the cap formation process. To discover small molecule inhibitors of nsp14 methyltransferase (MT) activity, we developed and employed a radiometric MT assay to screen a library of 161 in house synthesized S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) competitive methyltransferase inhibitors and SAM analogs. Among seven identified screening hits, SS148 inhibited nsp14 MT activity with an IC50 value of 70 {+/-} 6 nM and was selective against 20 human protein lysine methyltransferases indicating significant differences in SAM binding sites. Interestingly, DS0464 with IC50 value of 1.1 {+/-} 0.2 M showed a bi-substrate competitive inhibitor mechanism of action. Modeling the binding of this compound to nsp14 suggests that the terminal phenyl group extends into the RNA binding site. DS0464 was also selective against 28 out of 33 RNA, DNA, and protein methyltransferases. The structure-activity relationship provided by these compounds should guide the optimization of selective bi-substrate nsp14 inhibitors and may provide a path towards a novel class of antivirals against COVID-19, and possibly other coronaviruses.",Kanchan Devkota; Matthieu Schapira; Sumera Perveen; Aliakbar Khalili Yazdi; Fengling Li; Irene Chau; Pegah Ghiabi; Taraneh Hajian; Peter Loppnau; Albina Bolotokova; Karla J Satchell; Ke Wang; Deyao Li; Jing Liu; David Smil; Minkui Luo; Jian Jin; Paul V.

51,Adequate knowledge of COVID-19 impacts good practices amongst health profession students in the Philippines,"BackgroundThe spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Philippines started with its first suspected case on January 22, 2020. The government reacted by imposing several measures including community quarantine, class suspensions, drug therapy and vaccine development, and travel restrictions. This online survey was done amongst Filipino health professions undergraduate students to uncover the relationship between their knowledge, attitude, and practice during this pandemic.

MethodsCross-sectional data were obtained from an online survey done on students of medicine, dentistry, optometry, rehabilitative sciences, and pharmacy.

ResultsAt a response rate of 100% (n=1257), the results show that healthcare profession students in the Philippines have good knowledge (87.6%) and practices (63.6%) regarding COVID-19, yet attitude (63.6%) was just passable. This study also shows that a strong correlation exists between knowledge and practice concerning the current pandemic, r(2) = 0.08, P = 0.004.

53,Sexual dimorphism and plasticity in wing shape in three Diptera,"The ability of powered flight in insects facilitated their great evolutionary success allowing them to occupy various ecological niches. Beyond this primary task, wings are often involved in various premating behaviors, such as the generation of courtship songs and the initiation of mating in flight. These specific functions imply special adaptations of wing morphology, as well as sex-specific wing morphologies. Although wing morphology has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster, a comprehensive understa nding of sexual wing shape dimorphisms and developmental plasticity is missing for other Diptera. Therefore, we raised flies of the three Diptera species Drosophila melanogaster, Ceratitis capitata and Musca domestica at different environmental conditions and applied geometric morphometrics to analyze wing shape. Our data showed extensive interspecific differences in wing shape, as well as a clear sexual wing shape dimorphism in all three species. We revealed an impact of different rearing temperatures wing shape in all three species, which was mostly explained by plasticity in wing size in D. melanogaster. Rearing densities had significant effects on allometric wing shape in D. melanogaster, while no obvious effects were observed for the other two species. Additionally, we do not find evidence for sex-specific response to different rearing conditions in all three species. We determined species-specific and common trends in shape alterations, and we hypothesize developmental and functional implications of our data.

Contribution to the Field StatementThe size and shape of organisms and organs must be tightly controlled during development to ensure proper functionality. However, morphological traits vary considerably in nature contributing to phenotypic diversity. Such variation can be the result of evolutionary adaptations as well as plasticity for example as reaction to changing environmental conditions during development. It is therefore a major aim in Biology to unravel the processes that control differences in adult morphology. Insect wings are excellent models to study how organ size and shape evolves because they facilitate basic tasks such as mating and feeding. Accordingly, a tremendous variety of wings sizes and shapes evolved in nature. Additionally, plasticity in wing morphology in response to different rearing conditions has been observed in many insects contributing to phenotypic diversity. In this work we applied Geometric Morphometrics to study wing shape in the three Diptera species: the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, the Vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster and the housefly Musca domestica. Flies were raised in different temperature and density regimes that allowed us to study the effects of these environmental factors on wing shape. Additionally, in accordance with different mating behaviors of these flies, we observed a clear sexual shape dimorphism in all three species. Since the three studied species represent serious pests and disease vectors, our findings may contribute to existing and future monitoring efforts.",Rongxin Zhang; Ke Xiao; Yu Gu; Hongde Liu; Xiao Sun,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135749,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/135749,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,False
54,"Investigation and public health response to a COVID-19 outbreak in a rural resort community--Blaine County, Idaho, 2020","Blaine County, Idaho, a rural area with a renowned resort, experienced an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We undertook an epidemiologic investigation to describe the outbreak and guide public health action. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District.

Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13-April 10, 2020, a total of 451 COVID-19 cases occurred among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000 population). An additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Among the 451 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 51 years (Interquartile range [IQR]: 37-63), 52 (11.5%) were hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4-10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel. Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Of 562 close contacts monitored by public health authorities, 22 (3.9%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and an additional 29 (5.2%) experienced compatible symptoms. Sequencing results from 34 Idaho specimens supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks in rural communities can disrupt health services. Lack of local laboratory capacity led to long turnaround times for COVID-19 test results.

56,Host-virus chimeric events in SARS-CoV2 infected cells are infrequent and artifactual,"Pathogenic mechanisms underlying severe SARS-CoV2 infection remain largely unelucidated. High throughput sequencing technologies that capture genome and transcriptome information are key approaches to gain detailed mechanistic insights from infected cells. These techniques readily detect both pathogen and host-derived sequences, providing a means of studying host-pathogen interactions. Recent studies have reported the presence of host-virus chimeric (HVC) RNA in RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV2 infected cells and interpreted these findings as evidence of viral integration in the human genome as a potential pathogenic mechanism. Since SARS-CoV2 is a positive sense RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm it does not have a nuclear phase in its life cycle, it is biologically unlikely to be in a location where splicing events could result in genome integration. Here, we investigated the biological authenticity of HVC events. In contrast to true biological events such as mRNA splicing and genome rearrangement events, which generate reproducible chimeric sequencing fragments across different biological isolates, we found that HVC events across >100 RNA-seq libraries from patients with COVID-19 and infected cell lines, were highly irreproducible. RNA-seq library preparation is inherently error-prone due to random template switching during reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA. By counting chimeric events observed when constructing an RNA-seq library from human RNA and spike-in RNA from an unrelated species, such as fruit-fly, we estimated that ~1% of RNA-seq reads are artifactually chimeric. In SARS-CoV2 RNA-seq we found that the frequency of HVC events was, in fact, not greater than this background ""noise"". Finally, we developed a novel experimental approach to enrich SARS-CoV2 sequences from bulk RNA of infected cells. This method enriched viral sequences but did not enrich for HVC events, suggesting that the majority of HVC events are, in all likelihood, artifacts of library construction. In conclusion, our findings indicate that HVC events observed in RNA-sequencing libraries from SARS-CoV2 infected cells are extremely rare and are likely artifacts arising from either random template switching of reverse-transcriptase and/or sequence alignment errors. Therefore, the observed HVC events do not support SARS-CoV2 fusion to cellular genes and/or integration into human genomes.",Bingyu Yan; Srishti Chakravorty; Carmen Mirabelli; Luopin Wang; Jorge L.

57,Increased hazard of mortality in cases compatible with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1 - a matched cohort study,"ObjectivesTo establish whether there is any change in mortality associated with infection of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 (VOC-202012/1), first detected in UK in December 2020, compared to that associated with infection with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

DesignMatched cohort study. Cases are matched by age, gender, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimen, and differing only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay - a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection.

SettingUnited Kingdom, Pillar 2 COVID-19 testing centres using the taqPath assay.

Participants54,773 pairs of participants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Pillar 2 between 1st October 2020 and 29th January 2021.

Main outcome measures - Death within 28 days of first positive SARS-CoV-2 test.

ResultsThere is a high probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 (p <0.001). The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared to infection with previously circulating variants is 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 - 2.2) in patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase of deaths from 1.8 in 1000 to 3.1 in 1000 detected cases.

ConclusionsIf this finding is generalisable to other populations, VOC-202012/1 infections have the potential to cause substantial additional mortality over and previously circulating variants.

ParticipantsAll recorded deaths in Norway during March to May from 2010 to 2020.

Main outcome measuresRate (per 100 000) of all-cause mortality and causes of death in the EU Shortlist for Causes of Death March to May 2020. The rates were age-standardised and adjusted to a 100% register coverage and compared with a 95% prediction interval (PI) based on corresponding rates for 2010-2019.

Results113 710 deaths were included, of which 10 226 from 2020. We did not observe any deviation from predicted total mortality. There were fewer than predicted deaths from chronic lower respiratory diseases excluding asthma (11.4, 95% PI 11.8 to 15.2) and from other non-ischemic, non-rheumatic heart diseases (13.9, 95% PI 14.5 to 20.2). The death rates were higher than predicted for Alzheimers disease (7.3, 95% PI 5.5 to 7.3) and diabetes mellitus (4.1, 95% PI 2.1 to 3.4).

ConclusionsThere was no significant difference in the frequency of the major causes of death in the first wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. An increase in diabetes mellitus deaths and reduced mortality due to some heart and lung conditions may be linked to infection control measures.",Guttorm Raknes; Marianne Sorlie Strom; Gerhard Sulo; Simon Nygaard Overland; Mathieu Roelants; Petur Benedikt Juliusson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251326,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251326,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
59,A comparison of performance metrics for cloth face masks as source control devices for simulated cough and exhalation aerosols,"Universal mask wearing is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help control the spread of COVID-19. Masks reduce the expulsion of respiratory aerosols (called source control) and offer some protection to the wearer. However, masks vary greatly in their designs and construction materials, and it is not clear which are most effective. Our study tested 15 reusable cloth masks (which included face masks, neck gaiters, and bandanas), two medical masks, and two N95 filtering facepiece respirators as source control devices for aerosols [&le;] 7 {micro}m produced during simulated coughing and exhalation. These measurements were compared with the mask filtration efficiencies, airflow resistances, and fit factors. The source control collection efficiencies for the cloth masks ranged from 17% to 71% for coughing and 35% to 66% for exhalation. The filtration efficiencies of the cloth masks ranged from 1.4% to 98%, while the fit factors were 1.3 to 7.4 on an elastomeric manikin headform and 1.0 to 4.0 on human test subjects. The correlation coefficients between the source control efficacies and the other performance metrics ranged from 0.31 to 0.66 and were significant in all but one case. However, none of the alternative metrics were strong predictors of the source control performance of cloth masks. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the relationships between source control performance and metrics like filtration efficiency, airflow resistance, and fit factor are needed to develop simple methods to estimate the effectiveness of masks as source control devices for respiratory aerosols.",William G Lindsley; Francoise M Blachere; Donald H Beezhold; Brandon F Law; Raymond C Derk; Justin M Hettick; Karen Woodfork; William T Goldsmith; James R Harris; Matthew G Duling; Brenda Boutin; Timothy Nurkiewicz; John D Noti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251850,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251850,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
60,"Evaluating social and spatial inequalities of large scale rapid lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing in COVID-19 management: An observational study of Liverpool, UK (November 2020 to January 2021)","ObjectiveTo explore social and spatial inequalities in uptake and case-detection of rapid lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests (LFTs) offered to people without symptoms of COVID-19.

DesignObservational study.

SettingLiverpool, UK.

Participants496 784 residents.

InterventionFree LFTs to all people living and working in Liverpool (6th November 2020 to 31st January 2021).

Main outcome measuresResidents who received a LFT, residents who had multiple LFTs, and positive test results.

Results214 525 residents (43%) received a LFT identifying 5557 individuals as positive cases of COVID-19 (1.3%) between 6th November 2020 and 31st January 2021. 89 047 residents had more than one test (18%). Uptake was highest in November when there was military assistance. High uptake was observed again in the week preceding Christmas and was sustained into a national lockdown. Overall uptake and repeat testing were lower among males (e.g. 40% uptake over the whole period), Black Asian and other Minority Ethnic groups (e.g. 27% uptake for  Mixed ethnicity) and in the most deprived areas (e.g. 32% uptake in most deprived areas). These population groups were also more likely to have received positive tests for COVID-19. Spatial regression models demonstrated that uptake and repeat testing were lower in areas of higher deprivation, areas located further from test sites and areas containing populations less confident in the using Internet technologies. Positive tests were spatially clustered in deprived areas.

ConclusionsLarge-scale voluntary asymptomatic community testing saw social, ethnic, and spatial inequalities in an  inverse care pattern, but with an added digital exclusion factor. COVID-19 testing and support to isolate need to be more accessible to the vulnerable communities most impacted by the pandemic, including non-digital means of access.

61,Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Case Growth Highlights Evolving Demographic Risk Factors in Tennessee and Georgia,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the need to understand the unique risk drivers that contribute to uneven morbidity and mortality in US communities. Addressing the community-specific social determinants of health that correlate with spread of SARS-CoV-2 provides an opportunity for targeted public health intervention to promote greater resilience to viral respiratory infections in the future.

Our work combined publicly available COVID-19 statistics with county-level social determinants of health information. Machine learning models were trained to predict COVID-19 case growth and understand the unique social, physical and environmental risk factors associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Tennessee and Georgia counties. Model accuracy was assessed comparing predicted case counts to actual positive case counts in each county. The predictive models achieved a mean r-squared (R2) of 0.998 in both states with accuracy above 90% for all time points examined. Using these models, we tracked the social determinants of health, with a specific focus on demographics, that were strongly associated with COVID-19 case growth in Tennessee and Georgia counties. The demographic results point to dynamic racial trends in both states over time and varying, localized patterns of risk among counties within the same state.

63,Healthcare-associated COVID-19 in England: a national data linkage study,"ObjectivesNosocomial transmission was an important aspect of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks. Healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in single and multi-site hospital-based studies in England, but not nationally.

MethodsAdmission records for all hospitals in England were linked to SARS-CoV-2 national test data for the period 01/03/2020 to 31/08/2020. Case definitions were: community-onset community-acquired (CO.CA), first positive test (FPT) <14 days pre-admission, up to day 2 of admission; hospital-onset indeterminate healthcare-associated (HO.iHA), FPT on day 3-7; hospital-onset probable healthcare-associated (HO.pHA), FPT on day 8-14; hospital-onset definite healthcare-associated (HO.HA), FPT from day 15 of admission until discharge; community-onset possible healthcare-associated (CO.pHA), FPT [&le;]14 days post-discharge.

ResultsOne-third (34.4%, 100,859/293,204) of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were linked to a hospital record. HO.pHA and HO.HA cases represented 5.3% (15,564/293,204) of all laboratory-confirmed cases and 15.4% (15,564/100,859) of laboratory-confirmed cases among hospital patients. CO.CA and CO.pHA cases represented 86.5% (253,582/293,204) and 5.1% (14,913/293,204) of all laboratory-confirmed cases, respectively.

ConclusionsUp to 1 in 6 SARS-CoV-2 infections among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in England during the first 6 months of the pandemic could be attributed to nosocomial transmission, but these represent less than 1% of the estimated 3 million COVID-19 cases in this period.",Alex Bhattacharya; Simon M Collin; James Stimson; Simon Thelwall; Olisaeloka Nsonwu; Sarah Gerver; Julie Robotham; Mark Wilcox; Susan Hopkins; Russell Hope,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251625,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251625,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
64,An exploratory study on the correlation of population SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values to local disease dynamics,"IntroductionDespite limitations on the use of cycle threshold (CT) values for individual patient care, population distributions of CT values may be useful indicators of local outbreaks.

MethodsSpecimens from the greater El Paso area were processed in the Dascena COVID-19 Laboratory. Daily median CT value, daily transmission rate R(t), daily count of COVID-19 hospitalizations, daily change in percent positivity, and rolling averages of these features were plotted over time. Two-way scatterplots and linear regression evaluated possible associations between daily median CT and outbreak measures. Cross-correlation plots determined whether a time delay existed between changes in the daily median CT value and measure of community disease dynamics.

ResultsDaily median CT was negatively correlated with the daily R(t), the daily COVID-19 hospitalization count (with a time delay), and the daily change in percent positivity among testing samples. Despite visual trends suggesting time delays in the plots for median CT and outbreak measures, a statistically significant delay was only detected between changes in median CT and COVID-19 hospitalization count.

Self-collected specimens might decrease patient discomfort, conserve healthcare resources, and be preferred by patients. During August - November 2020, 1,806 adults undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing in Denver, Colorado and Atlanta, Georgia, provided self-collected anterior nares swabs (ANS) and saliva specimens before NPS collection. Compared to NPS, sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR appeared higher for saliva than for ANS (85% versus 80% in Denver; 67% versus 58% in Atlanta) and higher among participants reporting current symptoms (94% and 87% in Denver; 72% and 62% in Atlanta, for saliva and ANS, respectively) than among those reporting no symptoms (29% and 50% in Denver; 50% and 44% in Atlanta, for saliva and ANS, respectively).

66,The rise of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Israel intensifies the role of surveillance and vaccination in elderly,"Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic various generic variants have been described. Of specific interest is a new variant, which was observed in England during December 2020 and is now termed B.1.1.7. This variant is now associated with increased infectivity and therefore its spread within the community is of great importance. The Israeli government established three noteworthy programs namely, mass PCR testing, focused protection of the elderly and more recently an unparalleled prioritized vaccination program. In this study we analyzed primary data of >300,000 RT-PCR samples collected throughout December 6th 2020 until February 10th 2021 in the general community and nursing homes. We identified that within a period of six weeks, the B.1.1.7 variant was capable of out competing the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 strain to become the main strain. Furthermore, we show that the transmission of B.1.1.7 in the 60+ population reached a near complete halt, due to an ongoing surveillance testing program in nursing homes and the vaccination program of Israel. Thus, proactive protection programs such as routine surveillance and monitoring of populations at risk combined with prioritized vaccination, is achievable and will result in a reduction of severe illness and subsequent death.",Ariel Munitz; Matan Yechezkel; Yoav Dickstein; Dan Yamin; Motti Gerlic,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251819,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251819,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
67,"Size and duration of COVID-19 clusters go along with a high SARS-CoV-2 viral load : a spatio-temporal investigation in Vaud state, Switzerland","To understand the geographical and temporal spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of infection documented in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland, we analysed clusters of positive cases using the precise place of residence of 33651 individuals tested (RT-PCR) between January 10 and June 30, 2020. We identified both space-time (SaTScan) and transmission (MST-DBSCAN) clusters; we estimated their duration, their transmission behavior (emergence, growth, reduction, etc.) and relative risk. For each cluster, we computed the within number of individuals, their median age and viral load.

Among 1684 space-time clusters identified, 457 (27.1%) were significant (p [&le;] 0.05), i.e. harboring a higher relative risk of infection, as compared to other regions. They lasted a median of 11 days (IQR 7-13) and included a median of 12 individuals per cluster (IQR 5-20). The majority of significant clusters (n=260; 56.9 %) had at least one person with an extremely high viral load (above 1 billion copies/ml). Those clusters were considerably larger (median of 17 infected individuals, p < 0.001) than clusters with subjects showing a viral load lower than 1 million copies/ml (median of 3 infected individuals). The highest viral loads were found in clusters with the lowest average age, while clusters with the highest average age had low to middle viral load. Interestingly, in 20 significant clusters the viral load of three first cases were all below 100000 copies/ml suggesting that subjects with less than 100000 copies/ml may still have been contagious. Noteworthy, the dynamics of transmission clusters made it possible to identify three diffusion zones, which mainly differentiated rural from urban areas, the latter being more prone to last and spread in a new nearby clusters.

The use of geographic information is key for public health decision makers to mitigate the spread of the virus.

68,Circulatory Cytokines and Chemokines Profile in Human Coronaviruses: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundSARS, MERS, and COVID-19 share similar characteristics as the genetic homology of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is 80% and 50% respectively and cause similar clinical features. Uncontrolled release of proinflammatory mediators (cytokine storm) by activated immune cells in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 leads to severe phenotype development.

AimThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the inflammatory cytokines profile associated with severe human coronavirus diseases, including three stains: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2, in severe patients.

MethodPubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 2020. Randomized and Observational studies reporting the inflammatory cytokines associated with severe and non-severe human coronavirus diseases, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the pooled mean of inflammatory biomarkers.

ResultsA high level of circulating IL-6 could be associated with the severity of the three strains of coronaviruses infection. TNF, IL-10, and IL-8 is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Increased circulating levels of CXCL10/IP10 and CCL2/MCP-1 might also be related to the severity of MERS.

ConclusionThis study suggests that the immune response and immunopathology in the three severe human coronavirus strains are similar to some extent.

69,Densely sampled viral trajectories suggest longer duration of acute infection with B.1.1.7 variant relative to non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2,"To test whether acute infection with B.1.1.7 is associated with higher or more sustained nasopharyngeal viral concentrations, we assessed longitudinal PCR tests performed in a cohort of 65 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing daily surveillance testing, including seven infected with B.1.1.7. For individuals infected with B.1.1.7, the mean duration of the proliferation phase was 5.3 days (90% credible interval [2.7, 7.8]), the mean duration of the clearance phase was 8.0 days [6.1, 9.9], and the mean overall duration of infection (proliferation plus clearance) was 13.3 days [10.1, 16.5]. These compare to a mean proliferation phase of 2.0 days [0.7, 3.3], a mean clearance phase of 6.2 days [5.1, 7.1], and a mean duration of infection of 8.2 days [6.5, 9.7] for non-B.1.1.7 virus. The peak viral concentration for B.1.1.7 was 19.0 Ct [15.8, 22.0] compared to 20.2 Ct [19.0, 21.4] for non-B.1.1.7. This converts to 8.5 log10 RNA copies/ml [7.6, 9.4] for B.1.1.7 and 8.2 log10 RNA copies/ml [7.8, 8.5] for non-B.1.1.7. These data offer evidence that SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 may cause longer infections with similar peak viral concentration compared to non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2.

DesignA cohort study

Setting465 general practices in England within the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care database.

Population1,863,478 women aged over 18 years

MethodsWe identified a cohort of women with COVID-19 from the computerised medical records of the RCGP RSC database. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to quantify the association between HRT or COCP use, and all-cause mortality among women with COVID-19 in unadjusted and adjusted models.

ResultsThere were 5451 COVID-19 cases within the cohort. HRT was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of all-cause mortality in COVID-19 (adjusted OR 0.22, 95%{square}CI 0.05 to 0.94). There were no reported events for all-cause mortality in women prescribed COCPs. This prevented further examination of the impact of COCP.

ConclusionsWomen on HRT with COVID-19 had a lower likelihood of death. Further work is needed in larger cohorts to examine the association of COCP in COVID-19. Our findings support the current hypothesis that oestrogens may contribute a protective effect against COVID-19 severity.

71,SEIR Filter: A Stochastic Model of Epidemic,"There are many epidemiological models at hand to cope with the present pandemic; it is, however, difficult to calibrate these models when data are noisy, partial or observed only indirectly. It is also difficult to distinguish relevant data from noise, and to distinguish the impact of individual determinants of the epidemic.

In mathematical statistics, the tools to handle all of these phenomena exist; however, they are seldom used for epidemiological models. The goal of this paper is to start filling this gap by proposing a general stochastic epidemiological model, which we call SEIR Filter.

Technically our model is a heterogeneous partially observable vector autoregression model, in which we are able to express closed form formulas for the distribution of compartments and observations, so both maximum likelihood and least square estimators are analytically tractable. We give conditions for vanishing, explosion and stationary behaviour of the epidemic and we are able to express a closed form formula for reproduction number.

Finally, we present several examples of the models application. We construct an estimate age-cohort model of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic.

72,When efficacy and adherence conflict: preferences and patterns of response to public health advice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"With recurring waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, a dilemma facing public health leadership is whether to provide public advice that is medically optimal (e.g., most protective against infection if followed), but unlikely to be adhered to, or advice that is less protective but is more likely to be followed. To provide insight about this dilemma, we examined and quantified public perceptions about the tradeoff between (a) the stand-alone value of health behavior advice, and (b) the advices adherence likelihood. In a series of studies about preference for public health leadership advice, we asked 1,061 participants to choose between (1) strict advice that is medically optimal if adhered to but which is less likely to be broadly followed, and (2) relaxed advice, which is less medically effective but more likely to gain adherence - given varying infection expectancies. Participants preference was consistent with risk aversion. Offering an informed choice alternative that shifts volition to advice recipients only strengthened risk aversion, but also demonstrated that informed choice was preferred as much or more than the risk-averse strict advice.",Oded Nov; Graham Dove; Martina Balestra; Katharine Lawrence; Devin Mann; Batia Wiesenfeld,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251765,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251765,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True

This study aims to assess the incidence of pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, risk factors and the impact on survival.

MethodA retrospective case-control study was conducted at Al-Noor Specialist Hospital in, Saudi Arabia between March 15, 2020, and June 15, 2020. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism by Computed Tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) formed the case group. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and without confirmed diagnose of pulmonary embolism formed the control group. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of pulmonary embolism and its survival.

ResultsA total of 159 patients participated were included in the study, of which 51 were the cases (patients with pulmonary embolism) and 108 patients formed the control group (patients without pulmonary embolism). The incidence of PE among hospitalized was around 32%. Smoking history, low level of oxygen saturation and higher D-dimer values were important risk factors that were associated with a higher risk of developing PE (p< 0.05).

74,Worries about COVID-19 infection and psychological distress at work and while commuting,"ObjectiveThis study examined the relationship between worry about COVID-19 infection in general, in the workplace and while commuting to work and psychological distress in the midst of a rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in Japan.

MethodsThis cross-sectional, internet monitor study was conducted on December 22- 26, 2020. Subjects were collected from throughout Japan. Out of a total of 33,302 participants, 26,841 people were included in the study after removing those providing fraudulent responses. The subjects were asked single-item questions about whether they were worried about COVID-19 infection in general, at work and while commuting to work. Kessler 6 (K6) was used to assess psychological distress. The odds ratios (ORs) of psychological distress associated with worry about infection were estimated using a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustment for sex, age, education, equivalent household income, occupation, number of business establishments, smoking status, alcohol consumption, frequency of telecommuting, use of public transportation, perceived assessment of workplace infection control efforts, presence of infection among acquaintances, and experience of being a close contact. Psychological distress was defined as a K6 score of 5 or higher and 13 or higher.

ResultsMultivariate analysis showed that the OR of severe psychological distress associated with general worry about COVID-19 infection was 1.10 (95% CI 1.00-1.22). The OR was significantly higher in association with worry about infection in the workplace at 1.71 (95%CI 1.53-1.92) and worry about infection while commuting at 1.49 (95%CI 1.32-1.67).

76,Evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on dispensing patterns: a national cohort analysis,"BackgroundMedication prescribing and dispensing often regarded as one of the most effective ways to manage and improve population health. Prescribed and dispensed medications can be monitored through data linkage for each patient. We hypothesised that changes in patient care resulting from COVID-19, changed the way patients access their prescribed medication.

ObjectiveTo develop an efficient approach for evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on drug dispensing patterns.

MethodsRetrospective observational study using national patient-level dispensing records in Wales-UK. Total dispensed drug items between 01-Jan-2016 and 31-Dec-2019 (counterfactual pre-COVID-19) were compared to 2020 (COVID-19 year). We compared trends of dispensed items in three main British National Formulary (BNF) sections(Cardiovascular system, Central Nervous System, Immunological & Vaccine) using European Age-Standardized rates. We developed an online tool to enable monitoring of changes in dispensing as the pandemic evolves.

ResultAmongst all BNF chapters, 52,357,639 items were dispensed in 2020 compared to 49,747,141 items in 2019 demonstrating a relative increase of 5.25% in 2020(95%CI[5.21,5.29]). Comparison of monthly patterns of 2020 and 2019 dispensed items showed a notable difference between the total number of dispensed drug items each month, with an average difference (D) of +290,055 and average Relative Change (RC) of +5.52%. The greatest RC was observed in a substantial March-2020 increase (D=+1,501,242 and RC=+28%), followed by second peak in June (D=+565,004, RC=+10.97%). May was characterised by lower dispensing (D=-399,244, RC=-5.9%). Cardiovascular categories were characterised, across all age groups, by dramatic March-2020 increases, at the epidemic peak, followed by months of lower than expected dispensing, and gradual recovery by September. The Central Nervous System category was similar, but with only a short decline in May, and quicker recovery. A stand-out grouping was Immunological and Vaccine, which dropped to very low levels across all age groups, and all months (including the March dispensing peak).

ConclusionsAberration in clinical service delivery during COVID-19 led to substantial changes in community pharmacy drug dispensing. This change may contribute to a long-term burden of COVID-19, raising the importance of a comprehensive and timely monitoring of changes for evaluation of the potential impact on clinical care and outcomes",Fatemeh Torabi; Ashley Akbari; Laura North; Daniel Harris; Gareth Davies; Mike Gravenor; Rowena Griffiths; Jane Lyons; Neil Jenkins; Andrew Morris; Julian Halcox; Ronan A.

77,'Trained immunity' from Mycobacterium spp. (environmental or BCG) exposure predicts protection from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Endeavors to identify protective variables that could be potentially responsible for reduced COVID-19 impact on certain populations have remained a priority. Multiple attempts have been made to attribute the reduced COVID-19 impact on populations to their bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination coverage ignoring the fact that the effect of childhood BCG vaccination wanes within the first 5 years of life while most of the COVID-19 cases as well as deaths have been observed in adults especially the aged with comorbidities. Since the supposed desired protection being investigated could come from heterologous  trained immunity conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. (i.e., environmental and BCG), it is argued that the estimates of the prevalence of  trained immunity of populations currently available as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) of populations would be a better variable to evaluate such assertions. Indeed, when we analyze the European populations (twenty-four) as well as erstwhile East and West Germany populations completely disregarding their BCG vaccination coverage, the populations with higher trained immunity prevalence consistently display reduced COVID-19 impact as compared to their lower trained immunity prevalence neighbors. The incidences, mortality, and interim case fatality rates (i-CFR) of COVID-19 are found negatively correlated with the trained immunity of populations that have comparable underlying confounders not the BCG coverage per se. It is submitted that to decisively arrive at dependable conclusions about the potential protective benefit that can be gained from BCG vaccination in COVID-19, the ongoing/planned randomized controlled trials should consciously consider including measures of trained immunity as - a) all individuals immunized do not respond equally, b) small study groups of higher background trained immunity could fail to indicate any protective effect.",Samer Singh; Rakesh K Singh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.20233593,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.20233593,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
78,"The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in autolysed samples from an exhumed decomposed body: Implications to virus survival, genome stability, and spatial distribution in tissues","Here we report for the first time the SARS-CoV-2 detection in autolysed samples from an exhumed decomposed body post-thirty six days after death. Both naso-oropharyngeal swabs and visceral samples from the lung, intestine, liver, and kidney were collected from the body exhumed post-fifteen days after burial, stored in viral transport medium and in saturated salt solution respectively. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs showed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome as identified by the amplification of viral E, N, RdRP, or ORF1ab genes by RT-PCR. Subsequent examination of tissues reveal the detection of the virus genome in the intestine and liver, while no detection in the kidney and lung. These results signify the genome stability and implicate the virus survival in decomposed swab samples and in tissues and thereafter in storage solution. Further results also indicate spatial distribution of the virus in tissues during the early stage of infection in the subject with no respiratory distress. Considering the presence of cool, humid, and moist location of the exhumation, the presence of virus genome might also indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can persist for more than seven days on the surface of dead bodies similar to the Ebola virus, confirming that transmission from deceased subjects is possible for an extended period after death. These results further reaffirm the robustness of the RT-PCR aiding in the detection of viruses or their genome in decomposed samples when other methods of detection could not be useful.",Mahadeshwara Prasad; Somanna Ajjamada Nachappa; Niveditha Anand; Deepika Udayawara Rudresh; Yashika Singh; Surabhi P.

79,IMMUNO-COV™ v2.0: Development and Validation of a High-Throughput Clinical Assay for Measuring SARS-CoV-2-Neutralizing Antibody Titers,"Neutralizing antibodies are key determinants of protection from future infection, yet well-validated high-throughput assays for measuring titers of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are not generally available. Here we describe the development and validation of IMMUNO-COV v2.0 a scalable surrogate virus assay, which titrates antibodies that block infection of Vero-ACE2 cells by a luciferase-encoding vesicular stomatitis virus displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (VSV-SARS2-Fluc). Antibody titers, calculated using a standard curve consisting of stepped concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody, correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with titers obtained from a gold-standard PRNT50% assay performed using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. IMMUNO-COV v2.0 was comprehensively validated using data acquired from 242 assay runs performed over seven days by five analysts, utilizing two separate virus lots, and 176 blood samples. Assay performance was acceptable for clinical use in human serum and plasma based on parameters including linearity, dynamic range, limit of blank and limit of detection, dilutional linearity and parallelism, precision, clinical agreement, matrix equivalence, clinical specificity and sensitivity, and robustness. Sufficient VSV-SARS2-Fluc virus reagent has been banked to test 5 million clinical samples. Notably, a significant drop in IMMUNO-COV v2.0 neutralizing antibody titers was observed over a six-month period in people recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of IMMUNO-COV v2.0 for measuring SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals and those recovering from natural infections. Such monitoring can be used to better understand what levels of neutralizing antibodies are required for protection from SARS-CoV-2, and what booster dosing schedules are needed to sustain vaccine-induced immunity.",Rianna Vandergaast; Timothy Carey; Samantha Reiter; Chase Lathrum; Patrycja Lech; Clement Gnanadurai; Michelle Haselton; Jason Buehler; Riya Narjari; Luke Schnebeck; Anne Roesler; Kara Sevola; Lukkana Suksanpaisan; Alice Bexon; Shruthi Naik; Bethany Brunton; Scott C.

80,Use of convalescent plasma in patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19): Systematic review and meta-analysis,"ObjetivesTo assess the effects of convalescent plasma treatment in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Study designSystematic review and Meta-analysis

Data sourcesA systematic search was carried out on the L {middle dot} OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19 until October 31, 2020

Study selectionRandomized clinical trials in which people with probable or confirmed COVID-19 were randomized to drug treatment, standard care, or placebo. Pairs of reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles.

MethodsThe PRISMA guidelines were followed for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2.0, and the certainty of the evidence using the recommendation assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach. For each outcome, the interventions were classified into groups, from most to least beneficial or harmful.

ResultsWe identified 10 RCTs (randomized controlled trials) involving 11854 patients in which convalescent plasma was compared with standard of care or other treatments. The results of five RCTs that evaluated the use of convalescent plasma in patients with COVID-19 did not show significant differences in the effect on mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.

ConclusionsCurrent evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of moderate or severe COVID-19.

81,covid19.Explorer: A web application and R package to explore United States COVID-19 data,"Beginning at the end of 2019, a novel virus (later identified as SARS-CoV-2) was characterized in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. As of the time of writing, the disease caused by this virus (known as COVID-19) has already resulted in over 2 million deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths, however, have been highly unevenly distributed among age groups, sexes, countries, and jurisdictions over the course of the pandemic. Herein, I present a tool (the covid19.Explorer R package and web application) that has been designed to explore and analyze publicly available United States COVID-19 infection and death data from the 2020/21 U.S. SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The analyses and visualizations that this R package and web application facilitate can help users better comprehend the geographic progress of the pandemic, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (such as lockdowns and other measures, which have varied widely among U.S. states), and the relative risks posed by COVID-19 to different age groups within the U.S. population.

82,The impact of COVID-19 on children with oesophageal atresia and/or tracheo-oesophageal fistula (OA/TOF),"PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global health crisis of unparalleled magnitude. The direct risk to the health of children is low. However, disease containment measures have society-wide impacts. This study explored the pandemic experiences of parents of children with oesophageal atresia/tracheo-oesophageal fistula in the UK.

DesignAn online forum was conducted using a private group on Facebook, in collaboration with a patient support group. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes.

ResultsThe online forum ran between 7th November-18th December 2020 with 109 participants. Themes related to healthcare and non-healthcare impacts. Parents experienced changes and limitations to healthcare access, anxiety regarding health risks, ""collateral"" damage to well-being because of isolation and an impact on finances and employment. Parents described a transition from worry about direct health risks to concern about the impact of isolation on socialisation and development. A process of risk-benefit analysis led some to transition to a more ""normal life"", while others continued to isolate. Benefits to their childs health from isolation, positive experiences with remote healthcare and a gradual easing of anxiety were also identified.

Implications and relevanceThis study highlights the wide-ranging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and their families. Although focussed on oesophageal atresia/tracheo-oesophageal fistula, the emerging themes will be relevant to many children with complex, chronic health conditions. There are implications for healthcare delivery, including telehealth, during and after the pandemic period. Accurate and consistent messaging is required.

83,Antimicrobial use in COVID-19 patients in the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Rapid review and evidence synthesis,"BackgroundAs the numbers of people with COVID-19 continue to increase globally, concerns have been raised regarding the widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 patients and its consequences for antimicrobial resistance during the pandemic and beyond. The scale and determinants of antibiotic use in the early phase of the pandemic, and whether antibiotic prescribing is beneficial to treatment effectiveness in COVID-19 patients, are still unknown. Unwarranted treatment of this viral infection with antibiotics may exacerbate the problem of antibiotic resistance, while antibiotic resistance may render presumptive treatment of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients ineffective.

MethodsThis rapid review was undertaken to identify studies reporting antimicrobial use in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The review was conducted to comply with PRISMA guidelines for Scoping Reviews (http://www.prisma-statement.org/Extensions/ScopingReviews) and the protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF): http://osf.io/vp6t5. The following databases: Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed, CNKI & VIP were searched to identify the relevant studies from 1 Dec 2019 up to 15 June 2020; no limits were set on the language or the country where studies were conducted. The search terms used were: ((""Covid-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" or ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2"") and ((""antibiotic prescribing"" or ""antibiotic use"" or ""antibiotic*"") or ""antimicrobial *"" or ""antimicrobial therapy"" or ""antimicrobial resistance"" or ""antimicrobial stewardship"")). A total of 1216 records were identified through database searching and 118 clinical studies met the inclusion criteria and were taken into data extraction. A bespoke data extraction form was developed and validated through two independent, duplicate extraction of data from five Records. As all the included studies were descriptive in nature, we conducted descriptive synthesis of data and reported pooled estimates such as mean, percentage and frequency. We created a series of scenarios to capture the range of rationales for antibiotic prescribing presented in the included studies.

ResultsOur results show that during the early phase of the pandemic, 8501 out of 10 329 COVID-19 patients (82{middle dot}3%) were prescribed antibiotics; antibiotics were prescribed for COVID-19 patients regardless of reported severity, with a similar mean antibiotic prescribing rate between patients with severe or critical illness (75{middle dot}4%) and patients with mild or moderate illness (75{middle dot}1%). The top five frequently prescribed antibiotics for hospitalised COVID-19 patients were azithromycin (28{middle dot}0 % of studies), ceftriaxone (17{middle dot}8%), moxifloxacin (14{middle dot}4%), meropenem (14{middle dot}4%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12{middle dot}7%). The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics without clinical justification was 51{middle dot}5% vs 41{middle dot}9 % for patients with mild or moderate illness and those with severe or critical illness respectively. Comparison of patients who were provided antibiotics with a clinical justification with those who were given antibiotics without clinical justification showed lower mortality rates (9{middle dot}5% vs 13{middle dot}1%), higher discharge rates (80{middle dot}9% vs 69{middle dot}3%) and shorter length of hospital of stay (9{middle dot}3 days vs 12{middle dot}2 days). Only 9{middle dot}7% of patients in our included studies were reported to have secondary infections.

ConclusionsAntibiotics were prescribed indiscriminately for hospitalised COVID-19 patients regardless of severity of illness during the early phase of the pandemic. COVID-19 related concerns and lack of knowledge drove a large proportion of antibiotic use without specific clinical justification.

84,"Knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations: a cross-sectional community survey in Bangladesh","BackgroundSeveral vaccines have been approved against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and distributed globally in different regions. However, general community knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations are poorly understood. Thus, the study aimed to investigate community knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations in Bangladesh.

MethodsAn exploratory and anonymous population-based e-survey was conducted among 1658 general individuals (55.6% male; mean age=23.17{+/-}6.05 years; age range=18-65 years). The survey was conducted using a semi-structured and self-reported questionnaire containing informed consent along with four sections (i.e., socio-demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions). Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the variables predicting knowledge, and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinations.

ResultsThe mean scores of knowledge and attitudes were 2.83{+/-}1.48 (out of 5) and 9.34{+/-}2.39 (out of 12) respectively. About a quarter of participants thought that the COVID-19 vaccination available in Bangladesh is safe, only 60% will have the vaccination and about two-thirds will recommend it to family and friends. In the multiple regression model, higher SES, having university/ higher levels of education, holding nuclear families and having previous history of essential vaccines uptake were associated with knowledge; whilst attitudes were significantly associated with being female and having previous history of essential vaccines uptake. Just over half of the participants thought that everyone should be vaccinated and 61% responded that health workers should be vaccinated first on priority basis. 95% vaccine should be administered free of charge in Bangladesh and almost 90% believed that the COVID-19 vaccine used in Bangladesh may have side effects.

ConclusionsThe findings reflect inadequate knowledge but more positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Bangladesh.

85,Experiences of supported isolation in returning travellers during the early COVID-19 response: an interview study,"ObjectivesTo understand the experiences of those who underwent supported isolation as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, after returning to the UK from Wuhan, China.

DesignWe used semi-structured interviews to capture participants experiences and perceptions of supported isolation.

SettingTelephone interviews carried out within approximately one month of an individual leaving supported isolation.

Participants26 people who underwent supported isolation at either Arrowe Park Hospital (n = 18) or Kents Hill Park Conference Centre (n = 8) after being repatriated from Wuhan in January - February 2020.

ResultsParticipants were willing to undergo supported isolation because they understood that it would protect themselves and others. Positive treatment by staff was fundamental to participants willingness to comply with isolation procedures. Despite the high level of compliance, participants expressed some uncertainty about what the process would involve.

ConclusionsAs hotel quarantine is introduced across the UK for international arrivals, our findings suggest that those in charge should: communicate effectively before, during and after quarantine, emphasising why quarantine is important and how it will protect others; avoid enforcement and focus on supporting and promoting voluntary compliance; facilitate shared social experiences for those in quarantine; and ensure all necessary supplies are provided.

86,Associations of Race/Ethnicity and Other Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors with Vaccination During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States,"BACKGROUNDTo date, there has been limited data available to understand the associations between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and related characteristics with COVID-19 vaccine initiation and planned vaccination in the United States. To better characterize COVID-19 vaccinations nationally, the present study leveraged nationally-representative data with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data to estimate levels of vaccine initiation and the adjusted relative odds of vaccine initiation and planned vaccination among adults by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and other characteristics.

METHODSUsing pooled cross-sectional data from 66,994 adults aged 18-85 years in nationally-representative surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau administered between January 6, 2021 and January 18, 2021 and multivariable logistic regression, this study estimated the associations between race/ethnicity, education, and pre-pandemic (2019) household income with the self-reported: 1) receipt of [&ge;]1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; and 2) either receipt of [&ge;]1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or the plan to definitely receive a vaccine once available to the respondent.

RESULTSIn Hispanics and Black non-Hispanics, the estimated prevalences of vaccine initiation were 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to 8.7% in White non-Hispanics and 15.1% in Asian non-Hispanics. Controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors, Hispanics and Black non-Hispanics were no more or less likely than White non-Hispanics to have received [&ge;]1 vaccine dose. However, for the combined outcome of either vaccine initiation or planned vaccination, Black non-Hispanics were 52% less likely than White non-Hispanics to have reported either outcome (P<.001). Meanwhile, both education and pre-pandemic income levels exhibited evidence of positive dose-response relationships with vaccine initiation (P for linear trend = .01 and <.001, respectively). Substantial (vs. no) financial hardship was linked to 44% lower odds of vaccination (P<.001). The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about side effects and safety.

CONCLUSIONSIn this large, nationally-representative study with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data, we find that being Black non-Hispanic and having the least education and income were each independently associated with a markedly lower likelihood of definitely planning to get vaccinated or having been vaccinated. In the ensuing months of the pandemic, addressing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in vaccination due to differential access and vaccine hesitancy will be critical to mitigate the pandemics disproportionately higher risks of infection and adverse outcomes in Black non-Hispanics and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and to help maximize vaccination coverage nationwide.",Daniel Kim,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251769,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251769,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
87,COVID-BioB Cohort Study: the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic COVID-19 is persistent and critical for virus control and survival.,"Understanding how antibody to SARS-CoV-2 evolve during infection may provide important insight into therapeutic approaches to prevent fatal COVID-19 illness and vaccines. Here, we profile the antibody response of 162 well-characterized COVID-19 symptomatic patients followed longitudinally for up to eight months from symptom onset. Using two newly developed assays we detect SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and antibodies binding to Spike antigens and nucleoprotein as well as to Spike S2 antigen of seasonal beta-coronaviruses, and to hemagglutinin of the H1N1 flu virus. Presence of neutralizing antibodies withing the first weeks from symptom onset correlates with time to a negative swab result (p=0.002) while lack of neutralization with an increased risk of a fatal disease outcome (HR 2.918, 95%CI 1.321-6.449; p=0.008). Neutralizing antibody titers progressively drop after 5-8 weeks but are still detectable up to 8 months in the majority of recovered patients regardless of age or co-morbidities. IgG to Spike antigens are the best correlate of neutralization. Antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses are temporary boosted and parallel those to SARS-CoV-2 without dampening the specific response or worsening disease progression. Thus, a compromised immune response to the Spike rather than an enhanced one is a major trait of patients with critical conditions. Patients should be promptly identified and immediately start therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring their immunity.",Stefania Dispinseri; Massimiliano Secchi; Maria Franca Pirillo; Monica Tolazzi; Martina Borghi; Cristina Brigatti; Maria Laura De Angelis; Marco Baratella; Elena Bazzigaluppi; Giulietta Venturi; Francesca Sironi; Andrea Canitano; Ilaria Marzinotto; Cristina Tresoldi; Fabio Ciceri; Lorenzo Piemonti; Donatella Negri; Andrea Cara; Vito Lampasona; Gabriella Scarlatti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251929,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251929,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
88,Risk factors for long-term consequences of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults in Moscow using the ISARIC Global follow-up protocol: StopCOVID cohort study,"BackgroundThe long-term sequalae of COVID-19 remain poorly characterised. In this study, we aimed to assess long-standing symptoms (LS) (symptoms lasting from the time of discharge) in previously hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and assess associated risk factors.

MethodsThis is a longitudinal cohort study of adults ([&ge;]18 years of age) with clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Sechenov University Hospital Network in Moscow, Russia. Data were collected from patients discharged between April 8 and July 10, 2020. Participants were interviewed via telephone using Tier 1 ISARIC Long-term Follow-up Study CRF and the WHO CRF for Post COVID conditions. Reported symptoms were further categorised based on the system(s) involved. Additional information on dyspnoea, quality of life and fatigue was collected using validated instruments. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to investigate risk factors for development of LS categories.

FindingsOverall, 2,649 of 4,755 patients discharged from the hospitals were available for the follow-up and included in the study. The median age of the patients was 56 years (IQR, 46-66) and 1,353 (51.1%) were women. The median follow-up time since hospital discharge was 217.5 (200.4-235.5) days. At the time of the follow-up interview 1247 (47.1%) participants reported LS. Fatigue (21.2%, 551/2599), shortness of breath (14.5%, 378/2614) and forgetfulness (9.1%, 237/2597) were the most common LS reported. Chronic fatigue (25%, 658/2593) and respiratory (17.2% 451/2616) were the most common LS categories. with reporting of multi-system involvement (MSI) less common (11.3%; 299). Female sex was associated with LS categories of chronic fatigue with an odds ratio of 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.39 to 2.02), neurological (2.03, 1.60 to 2.58), mood and behaviour (1.83, 1.41 to 2.40), dermatological (3.26, 2.36 to 4.57), gastrointestinal (2.50, 1.64 to 3.89), sensory (1.73, 2.06 to 2.89) and respiratory (1.31, 1.06 to 1.62). Pre-existing asthma was associated with neurological (1.95, 1.25 to 2.98) and mood and behavioural changes (2.02, 1.24 to 3.18) and chronic pulmonary disease was associated with chronic fatigue (1.68, 1.21 to 2.32).

Interpretation6 to 8 months after acute infection episode almost a half of patients experience symptoms lasting since hospital discharge. One in ten individuals experiences MSI. Female sex is the main risk factor for majority of the LS categories. chronic pulmonary disease is associated with a higher risk of chronic fatigue development, and asthma with neurological and mood and behaviour changes. Individuals with LS and MSI should be the main target for future research and intervention strategies.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSEvidence suggests that COVID-19 may result in short- and long-term consequences to health. Most studies do not provide definitive answers due to a combination of short follow-up (2-3 months), small sample size, and use of non-standardised tools. There is a need to study the longer-term health consequences of previously hospitalised patients with COVID-19 infection and to identify risk factors for sequalae.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the largest cohort study (n=2,649) with the longest follow-up since hospital discharge (6-8 months) of previously hospitalised adult patients. We found that 6-8 months after discharge from the hospital, around a half (47.1%) of patients reported at least one long-standing symptom since discharge. Once categories of symptoms were assessed, chronic fatigue and respiratory problems were the most frequent clusters of long-standing symptoms in our patients. Of those patients having long-term symptoms, a smaller proportion (11.3%) had multisystem involvement, with three or more categories of long-standing symptoms present. Although most patients developed symptoms since discharge, a smaller number of individuals experienced symptom beginning symptom appearing weeks or months after the acute phase. Female sex was a predictor for most of the symptom categories at the time of the follow-up interview, with chronic pulmonary disease associated with chronic fatigue-related symptoms, and asthma with a higher risk of neurological symptoms, mood and behaviour problems.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe majority of patients experienced long-lasting symptoms 6 to 8 months after hospital discharge and almost half reported at least one long-standing symptom, with chronic fatigue and respiratory problems being the most frequent. A smaller number reported multisystem impacts with three or more long-standing categories present at follow-up. A higher risk was found for women, for chronic pulmonary disease with chronic fatigue, and neurological symptoms and mood and behaviour problems with asthma.

89,Harnessing recombinase polymerase amplification for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited settings,"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged testing capacity worldwide. The mass testing needed to stop the spread of the virus requires new molecular diagnostic tests that are faster and with reduced equipment requirement, but as sensitive as the current gold standard protocols based on polymerase chain reaction.

We developed a fast (25-35 minutes) molecular test using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification for simultaneous detection of two conserved regions of the virus, targeting the E and RdRP genes. The diagnostic platform offers two complementary detection methods: real-time fluorescence or visual dipstick.

The analytical sensitivity of the test by real-time fluorescence was 9.5 (95% CI: 7.0-18) RNA copies per reaction for the E gene and 17 (95% CI: 11-93) RNA copies per reaction for the RdRP gene. The analytical sensitivity for the dipstick readout was 130 (95% CI: 82-500) RNA copies per reaction. The assay showed high specificity with both detection methods when tested against common seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV model samples. The dipstick readout demonstrated potential for point-of-care testing, with simple or equipment-free incubation methods and a user-friendly prototype smartphone application was proposed with data capture and connectivity.

This ultrasensitive molecular test offers valuable advantages with a swift time-to-result and it requires minimal laboratory equipment compared to current gold standard assays. These features render this diagnostic platform more suitable for decentralised molecular testing.",Dounia Cherkaoui; Da Huang; Benjamin Miller; Rachel A McKendry,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251732,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251732,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
90,Ultrasensitive assay for saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection.,"Widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is highly valuable for identifying asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals to slow community disease transmission. However, there remains a technological gap for highly reliable, easy, and quick SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests that are suitable for frequent mass testing. Compared to the conventional nasopharyngeal (NP) swab-based tests, saliva-based methods are attractive due to easier and safer sampling protocols. Despite its merits in rapid turn-around-time and high throughput compared to traditional PCR-based technologies, the widespread use of saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests is hindered by limited analytical sensitivity of current methods. Here, we report the first ultrasensitive, saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay with an analytical sensitivity of < 0.32 pg/ml, corresponding to 4 viral RNA copies/{micro}l, which is comparable to that of PCR-based tests. Using the novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based S-PLEX immunoassay, we measured the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen concentration in 105 saliva samples obtained from non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients. Our assay displayed absolute specificity and high sensitivity (90.2%), where it correctly identified samples with viral loads up to 35 CT cycles by saliva-based PCR. Paired NP swab-based PCR results were also obtained for 86 cases for comparison. Our assay showed high concordance with saliva-based and NP swab-based PCR in samples with negative (< 0.32 pg/ml) and strongly positive (> 2 pg/ml) N antigen concentrations. Our study unveiled the ultrasensitivity and specificity of the saliva-based S-PLEX assay, demonstrating its clinical value as a high throughput, complementary alternative to PCR-based techniques. The novel technique is especially valuable in cases where compliance to frequent swabbing may be problematic (e.g. schools, nursing homes, etc.).",Annie Ren; Dorsa Sohaei; Ioannis Zacharioudakis; George B Sigal; Martin Stengelin; Anu Matthew; Christopher Campbell; Nikhil Padmanabhan; Daniel Romero; Jessica Joe; Antoninus Soosaipillai; Vathany Kulasingam; Tony Mazzulli; Xinliu Angel Li; Allison McGeer; Eleftherios P.

91,"Clinical evaluation of the Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific quantitative IgG and IgM assays in infected, recovered, and vaccinated groups","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose a significant burden on global health infrastructure. While identification and containment of new cases remains important, laboratories must now pivot and consider assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the setting of the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Here we have utilized the latest Abbott Alinity semi-quantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess antibody responses in a cohort of 1236 unique participants comprised of naive, SARS-CoV-2 infected, and vaccinated (including both naive and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples recovered prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naive, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP titers, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naive group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals had several fold higher IgGSP responses than naive following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and vaccination.",Madhusudhanan Narasimhan; Lenin Mahimainathan; Ellen Raj; Andrew E Clark; John Markantonis; Allen Green; Jing Xu; Jeffrey A SoRelle; Charles Alexis; Kimberly Fankhauser; Hiren Parikh; Kathleen Wilkinson; Annika Reczek; Nao Kopplin; Sruthi Yekkaluri; Jyoti Balani; Abey Thomas; Amit Singal; Ravi Sarode; Alagarraju Muthukumar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251940,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251940,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
92,Evaluation of sampling frequency and normalization of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations for capturing COVID-19 burdens in the community,"Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 provides an approach for assessing the infection burden across a city. For these data to be useful for public health, measurement variability and the relationship to case data need to be established. We measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in the influent of twelve wastewater treatment plants from August 2020 to January 2021. Replicate samples demonstrated that N1 gene target concentrations varied by {+/-}21% between technical replicate filters and by {+/-}14% between duplicate assays. COVID-19 cases were correlated significantly (rho[&ge;]0.70) to wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations for seven plants, including large and small cities. SARS-CoV-2 data normalized to flow improved correlations to reported COVID-19 cases for some plants but normalizing to a spiked recovery control (BCoV) or a fecal marker (PMMoV or HF183) generally reduced correlations. High frequency sampling demonstrated that a minimum of two samples collected per week was needed to maintain accuracy in trend analysis. We found a significantly different ratio of COVID-19 cases to SARS-CoV-2 loads in one of three large communities, suggesting a higher rate of undiagnosed cases. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance can provide a useful community-wide metric to assess the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Sandra L.

93,"Country differences in transmissibility, age distribution and case-fatality of SARS-CoV-2: a global ecological analysis","IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the world yet the first pandemic waves in many low-income countries appeared milder than initially forecasted through mathematical models. Hypotheses for this observed difference include under-ascertainment of cases and deaths, country population age structure, and immune modulation secondary to exposure to endemic parasitic infections. We conducted a country-level ecological study to describe patterns in key SARS-CoV-2 outcomes by country and region and to explore possible associations of the potential explanatory factors with these outcomes.

MethodsWe collected publicly available data at country level and compared them using standardisation techniques. We then explored the association between exposures and outcomes using alternative approaches: random forest (RF) regression and linear (LM) regression. We adjusted for potential confounders and plausible effect modifications.

ResultsAltogether, data on the mean time-varying reproduction number (mean Rt) were available for 153 countries, but standardised averages for the age of cases and deaths and for the case-fatality ratio (CFR) could only be computed for 61, 39 and 31 countries respectively. While mean Rt was highest in the WHO Europe and Americas regions, median age of death was lower in the Africa region even after standardisation, with broadly similar CFR. Population age was strongly associated with mean Rt and the age-standardised median age of observed cases and deaths in both RF and LM models. The models highlighted other plausible roles of population density, testing intensity and co-morbidity prevalence, but yielded uncertain results as regards exposure to common parasitic infections.

ConclusionsThe average age of a population seems to be an important country-level factor explaining both transmissibility and the median age of observed cases and deaths, even after age-standardisation. Potential associations between endemic infections and COVID-19 are worthy of further exploration but seem unlikely, from this analysis, to be key drivers of the variation in observed COVID-19 epidemic trends. Our study was limited by the availability of outcome data and its causally uncertain ecological design, with the observed distribution of age amongst reported cases and deaths suggesting key differences in surveillance and testing strategy and capacity by country and the representativeness of case reporting of infection.

94,Prediction of Mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a statewide health network,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSA predictive model to automatically identify the earliest determinants of both hospital discharge and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients could be of great assistance to caregivers if the predictive information is generated and made available in the immediate hours following admission.

ObjectiveTo identify the most important predictors of hospital discharge and mortality from measurements at admission for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingElectronic records from hospitalized patients.

ParticipantsPatients admitted between March 3rd and August 24th with COVID-19 in Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals.

Exposures216 phenotypic variables collected within 48 hours of admission.

Main OutcomesWe used age-stratified (<60 and >=60 years) random survival forests with competing risks to identify the most important predictors of death and discharge. Fine-Gray competing risk regression (FGR) models were then constructed based on the most important RSF-derived covariates.

ResultsOf 2212 patients, 1913 were discharged (age 57{+/-}19, time-to-discharge 9{+/-}11 days) while 279 died (age 75{+/-}14, time to death 14{+/-}15 days). Patients >= 60 years were nearly 10 times as likely to die within 60 days of admission as those <60. As the pandemic evolved, the rate of hospital discharge increased in both older and younger patients. Incident death and hospital discharge were accurately predicted by measures of respiratory distress, inflammation, infection, renal function, red cell turn over and cardiac stress. FGR models for each of hospital discharge and mortality as outcomes based on these variables performed well in the older (AUC 0.80-0.85 at 60-days) and younger populations (AUC >0.90 at 60-days).

Conclusions and RelevanceWe identified markers collected within 2 days of admission that predict hospital discharge and mortality in COVID-19 patients and provide prediction models that may be used to guide patient care. Our proposed model suggests that hospital discharge and mortality can be forecasted with high accuracy based on 8-10 variables at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also point to several specific pathways that could be the focus of future investigations directed at reducing mortality and expediting hospital discharge among COVID-19 patients. Probability of hospital discharge increased over the course of the pandemic.

95,Convalescent plasma for preventing critical illness in COVID-19: A phase 2 trial and immune profile,"RationaleThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented event requiring rapid adaptation to changing clinical circumstances. Convalescent immune plasma (CIP) is a promising treatment that can be mobilized rapidly in a pandemic setting.

ObjectivesWe tested whether administration of SARS-CoV-2 CIP at hospital admission could reduce the rate of ICU transfer or 28 day mortality.

MethodsIn a single-arm phase II study, patients >18 years-old with respiratory symptoms documented with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to a non-ICU bed were administered two units of CIP within 72 hours of admission. Detection of respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction and circulating anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were measured before and at time points after CIP transfusion.

Measurements and Main ResultsTwenty-nine patients were transfused CIP and forty-eight contemporaneous controls were identified with comparable baseline characteristics. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA anti-spike, anti-receptor-binding domain, and anti-nucleocapsid significantly increased from baseline to post-transfusion for all proteins tested. In patients transfused with CIP, the rate of ICU transfer was 13.8% compared to 27.1% for controls with a hazard ratio 0.506 (95% CI 0.165-1.554), and 28-day mortality was 6.9% compared to 10.4% for controls, hazard ratio 0.640 (95% CI 0.124-3.298).

ConclusionsTransfusion of high-titer CIP to patients early after admission with COVID-19 respiratory disease was associated with reduced ICU transfer and 28-day mortality but was not statistically significant.

96,Clinical performance of oral sponge sampling for detection by RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe current standard for coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) diagnosis is reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of naso-pharyngeal swabs (NPS), Sampling with NPS is invasive and requires specialized and trained personnel, which limits rapid and repeated screening for the disease. A less invasive and possibly self-administered sampling method may increase the capacity for testing and be more effective in identifying, isolating, and filtering out currently infected persons.

MethodsOver a period of three months, we included volunteers presenting with recent symptoms suggestive of a SARS-CoV-2 infection at a free COVID-19 screening center in the city of Nice, France. NPS as well as nasal and oral sponges were collected in parallel and analyzed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsOne hundred and forty-seven subjects were included, of whom, 41.5% were diagnosed with COVID-19 using NPS RT-PCR. RT-PCR on nasal and oral sponges showed a sensitivity of 87 to 98% and 72 to 87%, respectively for diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic subjects, depending on the type of RT-PCR technique used. The specificity was 100% whatever the RT-PCR test. The viral load determined with the oral samples was significantly lower than with NPS.

ConclusionTaken together, these results demonstrated that the oral sponge sampling method can be standardized, is easy to use and cheap. The acceptability makes it a repeatable test, notably for elderly people or children. It may become a high-frequency - low analytical sensitive testing strategy.

MethodsObservational cohort study of adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure. Patients were divided into COVID+ and COVID- based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs and/or endotracheal aspirates. No COVID-19 specific interventions were given. The primary clinical outcome was death in the ICU within 3 months; secondary outcomes included in-hospital death and disease severity measures. Measurements including autoantibodies, were done longitudinally. ANOVA and Fishers exact test were used with =0.05, with a false discovery rate of q=0.05. Bayesian analysis was performed to provide credible estimates of the possible states of nature compatible with our results.

Results22 COVID+ and 20 COVID- patients were recruited, 69% males, median age 60.5 years. Overall, 64% had anti-nuclear antibodies, 38% had antigen-specific autoantibodies, 31% had myositis related autoantibodies, and 38% had high levels of anti-cytokine autoantibodies. There were no statistically significant differences between COVID+ and COVID- for any of the clinical or autoantibody parameters. A specific pattern of anti-nuclear antibodies was associated with worse clinical severity for both cohorts.

ConclusionsSevere COVID+ patients have similar humoral autoimmune features as comparably ill COVID- patients, suggesting that autoantibodies are a feature of critical illness regardless of COVID-19 status.

98,"The unexpected dynamics of COVID-19 in Manaus, Brazil: Herd immunity versus interventions","The arrival of SARS-COV-2 in late March 2020 in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, captured worldwide attention and concern. The rapid growth of the epidemic, a health system that had collapsed, and mass gravesites for coping with growing numbers of dead, were broadcast by the media around the world. Moreover, a majority of the local Amazonian indigenous communities were physically distant from appropriate medical services, to the point where warnings of genocide were issued. In a recent Science paper (December 2020), Buss et al. reported that some 76% of the residents of the city of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, had been infected by October 2020. This estimate of the COVID-19 attack rate was based on a seroprevalence analysis of blood donor data, which despite its shortcomings was thought to be a sufficiently reliable proxy of the larger population. An attack rate of this magnitude (76%) implied that herd immunity had already been reached and the community was relatively protected from further infection. Yet in December 2020, a harsh second wave of COVID-19 struck Manaus, and currently appears to be even larger than the first wave. Here we use mathematical modelling of mortality data in Manaus, and in various states of Brazil, to understand why a second wave appeared against all expectations.

ResultsBetween the 11th of March and the 31st of October 2020, 285,352 persons were tested for SARS-CoV-2, with a median age (IQR) of 32 (22-43) years. 59.9% were from the Middle East and North Africa region and 29.6% originally from Asia. Overall, among them, 11.2% had diabetes mellitus and 11.4% had hypertension. The epidemiological curve showed a steep increase in positivity rate from March till June 2020 at the highest rate of 21.4% in June 2020. The highest positivity rate was observed among Asian males at 20.3%. The positivity rates were almost the same among the tested persons for SARS-CoV-2 in the main three age-groups (0-18, 19-39, 40-59) at 13%, 14.5%, and 14.0%, respectively. In a multi regression model, being a male was associated with a higher risk (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.18). Persons originally from Asia were at higher risk than those originally from the Middle East and North Africa (OR 1.5; 95% CI 147 to 1.54). COVID-19 infection was higher among those presenting with clinical symptoms than those asymptomatic (OR. 4.16; 95% CI 4.05 to 4.28).

ConclusionThe epidemic predominantly affected younger ages and males namely coming from Asia. At the primary health care level, COVID-19 infection rate was higher among those who presented with clinical symptoms. The scale-up of the testing at the primary health care level helped in detecting more cases and was reflected in a steady increase in the positivity rate to be flattened afterward.",Mohamed Ghaith Al-Kuwari; Mariam Ali Abdulmalik; Ahmad Haj Bakri; Mujeeb Chettiyam Kandy; Maha Youssef Abdulla; John Gibb,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251722,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251722,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
100,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in a University Community: A Longitudinal Study of the Impact of Student Return to Campus on Infection Risk Among Community Members,"BackgroundReturning university students represent large-scale, transient demographic shifts and a potential source of transmission to adjacent communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsIn this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a non-random cohort of residents living in Centre County prior to the Fall 2020 term at the Pennsylvania State University and following the conclusion of the Fall 2020 term. We also report the seroprevalence in a non-random cohort of students collected at the end of the Fall 2020 term.

FindingsOf 345 community participants, 19 (5{middle dot}5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at their first visit between 7 August and 2 October. Of 625 student participants who returned to campus for fall instruction, 195 (31{middle dot}2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between 26 October and 23 November. Twenty-eight (8{middle dot}1%) community participants returned a positive IgG antibody result by 9 December. Only contact with known SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and attendance at small gatherings (20-50 individuals) were significant predictors of detecting IgG antibodies among returning students (aOR, 95% CI: 3{middle dot}24, 2{middle dot}14-4{middle dot}91; 1{middle dot}62, 1{middle dot}08-2{middle dot}44; respectively).

InterpretationDespite high seroprevalence observed within the student population, seroprevalence in a longitudinal cohort of community residents was low and stable from before student arrival for the Fall 2020 term to after student departure. The study implies that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur in geographically coincident populations.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThis study was initiated in Spring of 2020, during the pandemic but prior to the return of students to US universities. There was no prior research on the consequences of the return to in-person university instruction on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While the explicit case of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between student and resident communities was poorly understood at the start of this study, there is a well-established literature that has documented the role that large population movements, consistent with the return of students to campuses, play in the introduction and maintenance of pathogen transmission or diseases. Several studies documented the role of travelers in the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to populations. The return of students to colleges and universities creates the potential for SARS-CoV-2 introduction and transmission with a sustained increase in population size, density, and mixing. No prior study has considered the long-term transmission consequences of such demographic change on the pre-influx population. We searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and Google Scholar between May 2020 and September 2020. We used search terms ""seroprevalence"", ""anti-SARS-CoV-2"", ""IgG"", ""COVID antibodies"" and ""university"", ""college"". Several modeling studies had been conducted to project likely prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in student and resident populations resulting from the return of students to in-person instruction in the Fall 2020 term in the US and UK. Several studies conducted after September 2020 described the county-level incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in counties that contain colleges and universities. None of these studies specifically disaggregated the incidence of COVID in resident and student populations.

Added value of this studyThere is clear evidence that in-person university instruction is correlated with high incidence in students and higher incidence in counties with colleges and universities in counties those without such institutions. However, this is the first study to specifically quantify the change in seroprevalence in non-student residents associated with the return of students to in-person instruction in a large university setting. Despite high COVID-19 incidence in the student population, seroprevalence in the community resident cohort was low and stable from before student arrival for the Fall 2020 term until after student departure. The results of this study highlight the potential for significant heterogeneity in incidence in geographically coincident sub-populations.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe influx of students into college and university towns reflects a significant increase in population size and density that could result in increases in COVID-19 risk in surrounding communities. Despite the potential risk, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 transmission may lag behind in surrounding communities This implies the potential to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from high prevalence sub-populations with targeted interventions. Future work should investigate the relative efficacy of specific measures to reduce risk of transmission between subpopulations and guide communities with high levels of episodic migration and similar high-density subpopulations.",Callum Arnold; Sreenidhi Srinivasan; Catherine M Herzog; Abhinay Gontu; Nita Bharti; Meg Small; Connie J Rogers; Margeaux M Schade; Suresh V Kuchipudi; Vivek Kapur; Read Andrew; Matthew J Ferrari,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251942,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251942,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
101,Changes in the rate of cardiometabolic and pulmonary events during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundThere has been extensive speculation about the relationship between COVID-19 and various cardiometabolic and pulmonary conditions. This a complex question: COVID-19 may cause a cardiometabolic or respiratory event; admission for a clinical event may result in hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection; both may contribute to a patient surpassing the threshold for presenting to services; and the presence of a pandemic may change whether patients present to services at all. To inform analysis of these questions, we set out to describe the overall rate of various key clinical events over time, and their relationship with COVID-19.

MethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England, we used data from the OpenSAFELY platform containing data from approximately 40% of the population of England. We selected the whole adult population of 17m patients and within this identified two further mutually exclusive groups: patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the community; and patients hospitalised with COVID-19. We report counts of death, DVT, PE, ischaemic stroke, MI, heart failure, AKI and diabetic ketoacidosis in each month between February 2019 and October 2020 within each of: the general population, community SARS-CoV-2 cases, and hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Outcome events were defined using hospitalisations, GP records and cause of death data.

ResultsFor all outcomes except death there was a lower count of events in April 2020 compared to April 2019. For most outcomes the minimum count of events was in April 2020, where the decrease compared to April 2019 in events ranged from 5.9% (PE) to 40.0% (heart failure). Despite hospitalised COVID-19 patients making up just 0.14% of the population in April 2020, these patients accounted for an extremely high proportion of cardiometabolic and respiratory events in that month (range of proportions 10.3% (DVT) to 33.5% (AKI)).

InterpretationWe observed a substantial drop in the incidence of cardiometabolic and pulmonary events in the non-COVID-19 general population, but high occurrence of COVID-19 among patients with these events. Shortcomings in routine NHS secondary care data, especially around the timing and order of events, make causal interpretations challenging. We caution that the intermediate findings reported here should be used to inform the design and interpretation of any studies using a general population comparator to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 and other clinical events.",Alex J Walker; John Tazare; George Hickman; Christopher T Rentsch; Elizabeth J Williamson; Krishnan Bhaskaran; David Evans; Kevin Wing; Rohini Mathur; Angel YS Wong; Anna Schultze; Sebastian CJ Bacon; Christopher Bates; Caroline E Morton; Helen J Curtis; Emily Nightingale; Helen I McDonald; Amir Mehrkar; Peter Inglesby; Brian MacKenna; Jonathan Cockburn; William J Hulme; Harriet Forbes; Caroline Minassian; Richard Croker; John Parry; Frank Hester; Sam Harper; Rosalind M Eggo; Stephen JW Evans; Liam Smeeth; Ian J Douglas; Laurie Tomlinson; Ben Goldacre,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251812,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251812,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
102,Service user experiences and views regarding telemental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a co-produced framework analysis,"BackgroundThe prominence of telemental health, including providing care by video call and telephone, has greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are clear variations in uptake and acceptability, and concerns that digital exclusion may exacerbate previous inequalities in accessing good quality care. Greater understanding is needed of how service users experience telemental health, and what determines whether they engage and find it acceptable.

MethodsWe conducted a collaborative framework analysis of data from semi-structured interviews with a sample of people already experiencing mental health problems prior to the pandemic. Data relevant to participants experiences and views regarding telemental health during the pandemic was identified and extracted. Data collection and analysis used a participatory, coproduction approach where lived experience researchers, clinical and academic researchers contributed to all stages of data collection, analysis and interpretation of findings.

FindingsParticipants experiences and preferences regarding telemental health care were dynamic and varied across time, settings, and individuals. Participants preferences were shaped by the reason for contacting providers, their relationship with the care provider, and both parties access or acceptability to use remote technology. While face-to-face care tended to be the preferred option, participants identified benefits of remote care including making care more accessible for some populations and improved efficiency for functional appointments such as prescription reviews. Participants highlighted important new challenges around safety and privacy in online settings, and gave examples of good remote care strategies, including scheduling regular phone calls and developing guidelines about how to access remote care tools.

DiscussionParticipants in our study and previous literature have highlighted advantages of telemental health care, as well as significant limitations which hinder mental health support and exacerbate inequalities in access to services. Some of these limitations are seen as potentially removable, for example through staff training or better digital access for staff or service users. Others indicate a need to maintain traditional face-to-face contact at least for some appointments. There is a clear need for care to be flexible and individualised to service user circumstances and preferences. Further research is needed on ways of minimising digital exclusion and to support staff in making effective and collaborative use of relevant technologies.",Norha Vera San Juan; Prisha Shah; Merle Schlief; Rebecca Appleton; Patrick Nyikavaranda; Mary Birken; Una Foye; Natasha Lyons; Luke Sheridan-Rains; Zainab Dedat; Brynmor Lloyd-Evans; Justin J Needle; Alan Simpson; Nicola Morant; Sonia Johnson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251978,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251978,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
103,Assessing Age-Specific Vaccination Strategies and Post-Vaccination Reopening Policies for COVID-19 Control Using SEIR Modeling Approach,"BackgroundAs the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, it is badly needed to develop vaccination guidelines to prioritize the vaccination delivery in order to effectively stop COVID-19 epidemic and minimize the loss.

MethodsWe evaluated the effect of age-specific vaccination strategies on the number of infections and deaths using an SEIR model, considering the age structure and social contact patterns for different age groups for each of different countries.

ResultsIn general, the vaccination priority should be given to those younger people who are active in social contacts to minimize the number of infections; while the vaccination priority should be given to the elderly to minimize the number of deaths. But this principle may not always apply when the interaction of age structure and age-specific social contact patterns is complicated. Partially reopening schools, workplaces or households, the vaccination priority may need to be adjusted accordingly.

ConclusionsPrematurely reopening social contacts could initiate a new outbreak or even a new pandemic out of control if the vaccination rate and the detection rate are not high enough. Our result suggests that it requires at least nine months of vaccination before fully reopening social contacts in order to avoid a new pandemic.",Xia Wang; Hulin Wu; Sanyi Tang Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251981,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251981,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
104,"Assessment of knowledge, attitude and practices among Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) towards COVID-19: a descriptive cross-sectional study in Tripura, India","With the surge in COVID-19 cases, community healthcare workers (CHW) remain pivotal for proper dissemination of awareness of disease transmission and infection control measures among the communities in low- and middle-income countries. In this context, lack of adequate knowledge and appropriate attitude among the CHW can directly influence the COVID-19 management programme. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19 among the CHW of India known as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). A descriptive cross-sectional was conducted in the state of Tripura, Northeast India, among ASHAs with 14-, 4- and 3-item self-administered questionnaire for knowledge, attitude and practice. Around 61.2% of participants had the mean correct answer rate and the mean score of knowledge was 8.57{+/-} 2.25 ({+/-}SD). As per Blooms cut-off, it was observed that only 10% of the ASHAs had adequate knowledge, 30.9% showed positive attitude and 88% adhered to the good practices. It was observed that the indigenous ASHAs were 1.79 times more likely to adhere to the good practice of wearing masks during filed visits in the community (OR: 1.791, 95% CI: 1.059-3.028, p=0.030). Multinomial regression analysis showed that practice was significantly associated with fear of getting infected during service and the communitys fearfulness of ASHAs spreading the disease.

105,Change in vaccine willingness in Australia: August 2020 to January 2021,"The ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods ANU COVID-19 Impact Monitoring Survey Program asked the same group of respondents about their vaccine intentions in August 2020 and January 2021. The paper provides data on the vaccine willingness in Australia as of January 2021 and how this changed since August 2020 both at the national level and for particular individuals. The paper provides estimates of how vaccine willingness has changed for different population sub-groups and the individual level characteristics which are associated with changes in vaccine willingness. We find an overall decrease in vaccine willingness, with the biggest decline being those who would definitely get a vaccine as of August 2020 but said they would only probably get a vaccine as of January 2021. We also look at the factors associated with vaccine willingness, as well as the factors associated with change through time.

Executive summaryO_LIThe paper provides data on the vaccine willingness in Australia as of January 2021 and how this changed since August 2020 both at the national level and for particular individuals.
C_LIO_LIThere has been a substantial increase in vaccine resistance and hesitancy and a large decline in vaccine likeliness between August 2020 and January 2021
O_LICombined, 21.7 per cent of Australians said they probably or definitely would not get a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in January 2021, a significant and substantial increase from the 12.7 per cent of Australians who gave the same responses in August 2020.
C_LI
C_LIO_LIAt the individual level, 31.9 per cent of Australians became less willing to get the vaccine between August 2020 and January 2021 in that they moved from a more to a less willing category.
O_LIThere were still some Australians who became more willing over the period to get vaccinated (9.9 per cent).
C_LI
C_LIO_LIThe largest single flow across willingness categories was the 18.7 per cent of Australians who went from being definitely willing to get a COVID-19 vaccination to only probably willing to get one. There was a large decline in vaccine certainty, alongside increases in vaccine resistance.
C_LIO_LIWe found three attitudinal factors that were particularly important in explaining the decline in willingness. Those Australians who think too much is being made of COVID-19, those who have low confidence in hospitals and the health care system, and those who are not optimistic about the next 12 months had all decreased in terms of their willingness to get vaccinated once a vaccine is available.
O_LIIn addition to campaigns targeting vaccination directly, those programs that improve confidence, remind people of the dangers of COVID-19, but importantly highlight the potential for a much better 2022 all have the potential to improve vaccination rates.
C_LI
C_LIO_LIFemales, Indigenous Australians, those who speak a language other than English at home and those who have not completed Year 12 have all became less willing to get a vaccine since August 2020 compared to the rest of the Australian population.
O_LIThese population groups are arguably the most urgent focus of any public health campaigns to improve willingness, both because they have low willingness to start with, but also because there is the potential opportunity to bring their willingness back to what it was in August 2020 when there was a smaller gap with the rest of the Australian population.
C_LIO_LIThere is a real need to consider a significantly enhanced public health campaign in languages other than English
C_LIO_LIThere is a need to convey information to the general public in a way that is informative, reassuring and salient for those without a degree

106,Public Covid-19 X-ray datasets and their impact on model bias - a systematic review of a significant problem,"Computer-aided-diagnosis for COVID-19 based on chest X-ray suffers from weak bias assessment and limited quality-control. Undetected bias induced by inappropriate use of datasets, and improper consideration of confounders prevents the translation of prediction models into clinical practice. This study provides a systematic evaluation of publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets, determining their potential use and evaluating potential sources of bias.

Only 5 out of 256 identified datasets met at least the criteria for proper assessment of risk of bias and could be analysed in detail. Remarkably almost all of the datasets utilised in 78 papers published in peer-reviewed journals, are not among these 5 datasets, thus leading to models with high risk of bias. This raises concerns about the suitability of such models for clinical use.

107,"SARS-CoV-2 Shedding Dynamics Across the Respiratory Tract, Sex, and Disease Severity for Adult and Pediatric COVID-19","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo analyze SARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics across COVID-19 severity, the respiratory tract, sex and age cohorts (aged 0 to 17 years, 18 to 59 years, and 60 years or older).

DesignSystematic review and pooled analyses.

SettingMEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science Core Collection, medRxiv and bioRxiv were searched up to 20 November 2020.

ParticipantsThe systematic dataset included 1,266 adults and 136 children with COVID-19.

MeasurementsCase characteristics (COVID-19 severity, age and sex) and quantitative respiratory viral loads (rVLs).

ResultsIn the URT, adults with severe COVID-19 had higher rVLs at 1 DFSO than adults (P = 0.005) or children (P = 0.017) with nonsevere illness. Between 1-10 DFSO, severe adults had comparable rates of SARS-CoV-2 clearance from the URT as nonsevere adults (P = 0.479) and nonsevere children (P = 0.863). In the LRT, severe adults showed higher post-symptom-onset rVLs than nonsevere adults (P = 0.006). In the analyzed period (4-10 DFSO), severely affected adults had no significant trend in SARS-CoV-2 clearance from LRT (P = 0.105), whereas nonsevere adults showed a clear trend (P < 0.001). After stratifying for disease severity, sex and age (including child vs. adult) were not predictive of the duration of respiratory shedding.

LimitationLimited data on case comorbidities and few samples in some cohorts.

ConclusionHigh, persistent LRT shedding of SARS-CoV-2 characterized severe COVID-19 in adults. After symptom onset, severe cases tended to have higher URT shedding than their nonsevere counterparts. Disease severity, rather than age or sex, predicted SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. LRT specimens should more accurately prognosticate COVID-19 severity than URT specimens.

108,Diagnostic Performance of Pooled RT-PCR Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Detection,"BackgroundWith the high number of COVID-19 cases, a need to optimize testing strategy must be regarded to obtain timely diagnosis for early containment measures. With this, several studies have employed pooled RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 as this could potentially conserve laboratory resources while has the capacity to test several individuals. However, this was recommended to firstly validate the method as different laboratory reagents and equipment vary with its diagnostic performance.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of pooled SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabbed samples using RT-PCR technique.

MethodsA records review of two-staged pooled RT-PCR testing data from August 10, 26, 30 and September 5, 2020 was utilized from Northern Mindanao Medical Center COVID-19 Satellite Laboratory (formerly CHDNM TB Regional Center). For the first stage, using known samples, a total of 30 pools were made for each of the pooling size, 5- and 10-pooled, on both pooling phase, pre- and post-RNA extraction. One positive individual was used to represent each of the Cycle threshold values given (<24, 25-28, 29-32, 33-36, and 37-40) while the rest of the samples were negative. For the second stage, 54 pools of five from 270 random unknown samples were used to validate the results. Target gene performance of N gene and RdRp was also determined.

Key ResultsResults show that 5-pooled sample has higher sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 88.97-100), 66.95% (95% CI, 60.75-72.6), 28.18% (95% CI, 20.62-37.22), and 100% (95% CI, 97.66-100) compared to 10-pooled sample that has 87.1% (95% CI, 71.15-94.87), 56.9% (50.57-63.02), 20.77% (95% CI, 14.68-28.53) and 97.14% (95% CI, 92.88-98.88). Further, these Ct values were only from the N gene, emphasizing its higher diagnostic performance as well to detect SARS-CoV-2 compared to RdRp as only a few samples were detected, thus, no analysis was made.

ConclusionThis study found out that 5-pooled sample has better diagnostic performance compared to 10-pooled samples. Specifically, all positive individual samples were detected in 5-pooled samples in pre-RNA extraction phase which these results are evident and consistent on both known and unknown samples.

109,Estimating the Failure Risk of Hotel-based Quarantine for Preventing COVID-19 Outbreaks in Australia and New Zealand,"AimWith increasing global use of hotel-based quarantine as part of COVID-19 border control efforts, we aimed to assess its risk of failure.

MethodsWe searched official websites in both Australia and New Zealand (NZ) to identify outbreaks and border control failures associated with hotel quarantine (searches conducted up to 12 February 2021). We used two denominators: a) the estimated number of travelers who went through these facilities during the 2020 year up to 31 January 2021; and b) the equivalent number of SARS-CoV-2 positive people who went through these facilities.

ResultsUp to 31 January 2021, Australia had seven failures with one causing over 800 deaths and six resulting in lockdowns. In NZ there were nine failures, with one causing an outbreak with three deaths, and also a lockdown. The overall failure risk for those transiting quarantine was estimated at one failure per 20,702 travelers and one failure per 252 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (both countries combined). At the country level, there were 15.5 failures per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases transiting quarantine in NZ (95%CI: 5.4 to 25.7), compared to 2.0 per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Australia (0.5 to 3.5) - a greater than seven-fold difference in risk. Approaches to infection control and surveillance in hotel quarantine were found to vary widely by country and by state/territory.

ConclusionsThere appears to be a notable risk of failure with the use of hotel quarantine in these two countries.

110,Clinical validation of the quantitative Siemens SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG assay (sCOVG) reveals improved sensitivity and a good correlation with virus neutralization titers,"ObjectivesSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and induce a specific antibody response. Serological assays detecting IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein are useful to monitor the immune response after infection or vaccination. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sCOVG) assay.

MethodsSensitivity and specificity of the Siemens sCOVG test were evaluated on 178 patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection and 160 pre-pandemic samples in comparison with its predecessor test COV2G. Furthermore, correlation with virus neutralization titers was investigated on 134 samples of convalescent COVID-19 patients.

ResultsSpecificity of the sCOVG test was 99.4% and sensitivity was 90.5% (COV2G assay 78.7%; p<0.0001). S1-RBD antibody levels showed a good correlation with virus neutralization titers (r=0.843; p<0.0001) and an overall qualitative agreement of 98.5%. Finally, median S1-RBD IgG levels increase with age and were significantly higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median levels general ward: 25.7 U/ml; intensive care: 59.5 U/ml) than in outpatients (3.8 U/ml; p<0.0001).

111,Early pandemic molecular diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in children,"BackgroundIn the US, community circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely began in February 2020 after mostly travel-related cases. Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia began testing on 3/9/2020 for pediatric and adult patients, and for all admitted patients on 4/1/2020, allowing an early glimpse into the local molecular epidemiology of the virus.

MethodsWe obtained 169 SARS-CoV-2 samples (83 from patients <21 years old) from March through May and produced whole genome sequences. We used genotyping tools to track variants over time and to test for possible genotype associated clinical presentations and outcomes in children.

ResultsOur analysis uncovered 13 major lineages that changed in relative abundance as cases peaked in mid-April in Philadelphia. We detected at least 6 introductions of distinct viral variants into the population. As a group, children had more diverse virus genotypes than the adults tested. No strong differences in clinical variables were associated with genotypes.

ConclusionsWhole genome analysis revealed unexpected diversity, and distinct circulating viral variants within the initial peak of cases in Philadelphia. Most introductions appeared to be local from nearby states. Although limited by sample size, we found no evidence that different genotypes had different clinical impacts in children in this study.

SummaryUsing sequencing and a novel technique for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 diversity, we investigated 169 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (83 <21 years old). This analysis revealed unexpected diversity especially in children. No clear differences in clinical presentation were associated with the different virus lineages.",Ahmed M Moustafa; William Otto; Xiaowu Gai; Utsav Pandey; Alex Ryutov; Moiz Bootwalla; Dennis T Maglinte; Lishuang Shen; David Ruble; Dejerianne Ostrow; Jeffrey S Gerber; Jennifer Dien Bard; Rebecca M Harris; Paul Planet,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251960,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.21251960,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
112,ESC - a comprehensive resource for SARS-CoV-2 immune escape variants,"Ever since the breakout of COVID-19 disease, ceaseless genomic research to inspect the epidemiology and evolution of the pathogen has been undertaken globally. Large scale viral genome sequencing and analysis have uncovered the functional impact of numerous genetic variants in disease pathogenesis and transmission. Emerging evidence of mutations in spike protein domains escaping antibody neutralization is reported. We have a precise collation of manually curated variants in SARS-CoV-2 from literature with potential escape mechanisms from a range of neutralizing antibodies. This comprehensive repository encompasses a total of 532 variants accounting for 146 unique variants tested against 75 antibodies and patient convalescent plasma.

113,Mobility and COVID-19 in Andorra: Country-scale analysis of high-resolution mobility patterns and infection spread,"In the absence of effective vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mobility restrictions, were globally adopted as critically important strategies for curbing the spread of COVID-19. However, such interventions come with immense social and economic costs and the relative effectiveness of different mobility restrictions are not well understood. This study analyzed uniquely comprehensive datasets for the entirety of a small country, consisting of serology data, telecoms data, and COVID-19 case reports, in order to examine the relationship between mobility and transmission of COVID-19.

Andorra is a small European country where tourism is a large part of the economy. Stringent mobility restrictions were put in place in Spring 2020. Additionally, 91% of the population participated in a voluntary COVID-19 serology testing programme and those data were made available for this study. Furthermore, high resolution telecoms data for the entire population were available for analysis of mobility and proximity patterns. A set of mobility metrics were developed to indicate levels of crowding, stay-at-home rates, trip-making and contact with tourists. Mobility metrics were compared to infection rates across communities and transmission rate over time.

Several of these metrics were highly correlated with transmission rate, with a lead time of approximately 18 days, with some metrics more highly correlated than others. There was a stronger correlation for measures of crowding and inter-community trip-making, and a weaker correlation for total trips (including intra-community trips) and stay-at-homes rates.",Ronan M Doorley; Alex Berke; Ariel Noyman; Luis Alberto Alonso; Josep Ribo; Vanesa Arroyo; Marc Pons; Kent Larson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251977,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251977,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,True
114,Decreased neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 global variants by therapeutic anti-spike protein monoclonal antibodies,"Monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, notably, those developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly and Company have proven to provide protection against severe COVID-19. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with heavily mutated spike proteins raises the concern that the therapy could become less effective if any of the mutations disrupt epitopes engaged by the antibodies. In this study, we tested monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987 that are used in combination, for their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, mink cluster 5 and COH.20G/677H. We report that REGN10987 maintains most of its neutralization activity against viruses with B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and mink cluster 5 spike proteins but that REGN10933 has lost activity against B.1.351 and mink cluster 5. The failure of REGN10933 to neutralize B.1.351 is caused by the K417N and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain; the failure to neutralize the mink cluster 5 spike protein is caused by the Y453F mutation. The REGN10933 and REGN10987 combination was 9.1-fold less potent on B.1.351 and 16.2-fold less potent on mink cluster 5, raising concerns of reduced efficacy in the treatment of patients infected with variant viruses. The results suggest that there is a need to develop additional monoclonal antibodies that are not affected by the current spike protein mutations.",Takuya Tada; Belinda M Dcosta; Hao Zhou; Ada Vaill; Wes Kazmierski; Nathaniel R Landau,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431897,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431897,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,False
115,Predicting the zoonotic capacity of mammal species for SARS-CoV-2,"Spillback transmission from humans to animals, and secondary spillover from animal hosts back into humans, have now been documented for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to threatening animal health, virus variants arising from novel animal hosts have the potential to undermine global COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Numerous studies have therefore investigated the zoonotic capacity of various animal species for SARS-CoV-2, including predicting both species susceptibility to infection and their capacities for onward transmission. A major bottleneck to these studies is the limited number of sequences for ACE2, a key cellular receptor in chordates that is required for viral cell entry. Here, we combined protein structure modeling with machine learning of species traits to predict zoonotic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 across 5,400 mammals. High accuracy model predictions were strongly corroborated by in vivo empirical studies, and identify numerous mammal species across global COVID-19 hotspots that should be prioritized for surveillance and experimental validation.",Ilya R Fischhoff; Adrian A.

116,Chyawanprash for the prevention of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For persons who are at high risk of exposure, the standard of care is personal protection from getting infected. Whether Ayurvedic rasayana drug like Chyawanprash can prevent symptomatic infection in frontline health care workers is unknown.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of the combination of Chyawanprash and Standard Preventive Regimen compared to the use of Standard Preventive Regimen alone on the proportion of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs).

MethodsAn open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in the HCWs between 25 to 60 years age currently working in an environment with chance of direct exposure to COVID-19 cases. The interventions to be compared in this trial were Standard Preventive Regimen as per institutional guidelines and based on their roles (Group I) and Ayurvedic Intervention viz., Chyawanprash 12 g twice for 30 days from day of randomization plus Standard Preventive Regimen (Group II). The incidence of RT PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases in both groups, was the primary outcome measure. Evaluation of the safety of the study drug (by any statistically significant change in various biochemical and hematological parameters and occurrence of any adverse drug reactions); incidence of any other infective diseases (bacterial /viral/ fungal / etc.) like upper respiratory tract illness during the study period and any change in the immunoglobulins like IgG, IgM and IgE and inflammatory markers like TNF alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 were the secondary outcome measures.

ResultsOut of 193 participants who completed the study, no participant in both groups was COVID-19 positive at the end of one month. In post intervention follow-up, 4 subjects in Group I and 2 subjects in Group II were COVID-19 positive. No adverse drug reaction or any serious adverse event was reported during the study. No clinically significant change in the safety parameters was observed before and after the study. Statistically significant rise in Serum IgG level was seen in Group II but other inflammatory and immune markers did not show statistically significant difference.

ConclusionChyawanprash was well tolerated by all the participants in the intervention group but to prove its adaptogenic effect and efficacy as an add-on to the standard care in preventing the occurrence of COVID-19, clinical trial for longer duration with larger sample size is needed.

117,Antiviral activity of influenza A virus defective interfering particles against SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro through stimulation of innate immunity,"SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in a devastating pandemic. Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the end of 2020, vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 only show limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with produced, cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. These results suggest an unspecific stimulation of the innate immunity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.",Ulfert Rand; Sascha Young Kupke; Hanna Shkarlet; Marc Dominique Hein; Tatjana Hirsch; Pavel Marichal-Gallardo; Luka Cicin-Sain; Udo Reichl; Dunja Bruder,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.431972,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.431972,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,,False
118,SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution in the United States: High accumulation of viral mutations over time likely through serial Founder Events and mutational bursts.,"Since the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide and within a year has caused 2.29 million deaths globally. With dramatically increasing infection numbers, and the arrival of new variants with increased infectivity, tracking the evolution of its genome is crucial for effectively controlling the pandemic and informing vaccine platform development. Our study explores evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a representative cohort of sequences covering the entire genome in the United States, through all of 2020 and early 2021. Strikingly, we detected many accumulating Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a pattern indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report three major variants through October of 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and reveal clues to its evolution such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new variant, and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates, but with occasional mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel low frequency replacement mutations in the Spike protein, and a hypermutable glutamine residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally, the end of the year data revealed the presence of known variants of concern including B.1.1.7, which has acquired additional Spike mutations. Overall, our results suggest that predominant viral sequences are dynamically evolving over time, with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation. This high level of existing variation, even at low frequencies and especially in the Spike-encoding region may be become problematic when superspreader events, akin to serial Founder Events in evolution, drive these rare mutations to prominence.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThe pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the death of more than 2.29 million people and continues to be a severe threat internationally. Although simple measures such as social distancing, periodic lockdowns and hygiene protocols were immediately put into force, the infection rates were only temporarily minimized. When infection rates exploded again new variants of the virus began to emerge. Our study focuses on a representative set of sequences from the United States throughout 2020 and early 2021. We show that the driving force behind the variants of public health concern, is widespread infection and superspreader events. In particular, we show accumulation of mutations over time with little loss from genetic drift, including in the Spike region, which could be problematic for vaccines and therapies. This lurking accumulated genetic variation may be a superspreader event from becoming more common and lead to variants that can escape the immune protection provided by the existing vaccines.",Rafail Nikolaos Tasakis; Georgios Samaras; Anna Jamison; Michelle Lee; Alexandra Paulus; Gabrielle Whitehouse; Laurent Verkoczy; F.

119,Viral genetic sequencing identifies staff transmission of COVID-19 is important in a community hospital outbreak,"BackgroundWe have successfully used whole-genome sequencing to provide additional information for transmission pathways in infectious spread. We report and interpret genomic sequencing results in clinical context from a large outbreak of COVID-19 with 46 cases across staff and patients in a community hospital in the UK.

MethodsFollowing multiple symptomatic cases within a two-week period, all staff and patients were screened by RT-PCR and staff subsequently had serology tests.

ResultsThirty staff (25%) and 16 patients (62%) tested positive for COVID-19. Genomic sequencing data showed significant overlap of viral haplotypes in staff who had overlapping shift patterns. Patient haplotypes were more distinct from each other but had overlap with staff haplotypes.

120,Efficiency Improvements and Discovery of New Substrates for a SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease FRET Assay,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a huge impact on the world. Although several vaccines have recently reached the market, the development of specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is an important additional strategy in fighting the pandemic. One of the most promising pharmacological targets is the viral main protease (Mpro). Here, we present an optimized biochemical assay procedure for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We have comprehensively investigated the influence of different buffer components and conditions on the assay performance, and characterized six FRET substrates with a 2-Abz/Tyr(3-NO2) FRET pair. The substrates 2-AbzSAVLQSGTyr(3-NO2)R-OH, a truncated version of the established DABCYL/EDANS FRET substrate, and a new substrate 2-AbzVVTLQSGTyr(3-NO2)R-OH are promising candidates for screening and inhibitor characterization. In the latter substrate, the incorporation of Val at the position P5 improved the catalytic efficacy.

121,Evaluation of a fully automated high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex qPCR assay with build-in screening functionality for DelHV69/70- and N501Y variants such as B.1.1.7,"1BackgroundNew SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility, like B.1.1.7 from England or B1.351 from South Africa, have caused considerable concern worldwide. In order to contain the spread of these lineages, it is of utmost importance to have rapid, sensitive and high-throughput detection methods at hand.

MethodsAnalytical sensitivity was assessed for both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 lineage by serial dilution. A total of 141 clinical samples were subjected to the test and results compared to a commercial manual typing-PCR assay and NGS.

ResultsThe multiplex assay is highly sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples, with an LoD of 25.82 cp/ml (CI: 11.61 - 57.48). LoDs are slightly higher for the HV68/70 deletion (111.36 cp/ml; CI: 78.16 - 158.67) and the N501Y SNP (2548.04 cp/ml, CI: 1592.58 - 4076.73). A total of 141 clinical samples were tested with the assay, including 16 samples containing SARS-CoV-2 of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Three non-B.1.1.7 samples contained a HV69/70 deletion. All were correctly identified by the multiplex assay.

ConclusionWe describe here a highly sensitive, fully automated multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of del-HV69/70 and N501Y that can distinguish between lineages B.1.1.7 and B1.351.

122,"Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genetic structure and infection clusters in a large German city based on integrated genomic surveillance, outbreak analysis, and contact tracing","Viral genome sequencing can address key questions about SARS-CoV-2 evolution and viral transmission. Here, we present an integrated system of genomic surveillance in the German city of Dusseldorf, combining a) viral surveillance sequencing, b) genetically based identification of infection clusters in the population, c) analysis of hospital outbreaks, d) integration of public health authority contact tracing data, and e) a user-friendly dashboard application as a central data analysis platform. The generated surveillance sequencing data (n = 320 SARS-CoV-2 genomes) showed that the development of the local viral population structure from August to December 2020 was consistent with European trends, with the notable absence of SARS-CoV-2 variants 20I/501Y.V1/B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 until the end of the local sampling period. Against a background of local surveillance and other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 data, four putative SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at Dusseldorf University Hospital between October and December 2020 (n = 44 viral genomes) were investigated and confirmed as clonal, contributing to the development of improved infection control and prevention measures. An analysis of the generated surveillance sequencing data with respect to infection clusters in the population based on a greedy clustering algorithm identified five candidate clusters, all of which were subsequently confirmed by the integration of public health authority contact tracing data and shown to be represent transmission settings of particular relevance (schools, care homes). A joint analysis of outbreak and surveillance data identified a potential transmission of an outbreak strain from the local population into the hospital and back; and an in-depth analysis of one population infection cluster combining genetic with contact tracing data enabled the identification of a previously unrecognized population transmission chain involving a martial arts gym. Based on these results and a real-time sequencing experiment in which we demonstrated the feasibility of achieving sample-to-turnaround times of <30 hours with the Oxford Nanopore technology, we discuss the potential benefits of routine ultra-fast sequencing of all detected infections for contact tracing, infection cluster detection, and, ultimately, improved management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Andreas Walker; Torsten Houwaart; Patrick Finzer; Lutz Ehlkes; Alona Tyshaieva; Maximilian Damagnez; Daniel Strelow; Ashley Duplessis; Jessica Nicolai; Tobias Wienemann; Teresa Tamayo; Malte Kohns Vasconcelos; Lisanna Hülse; Katrin Hoffmann; Nadine Lübke; Sandra Hauka; Marcel Andree; Martin P Däumer; Alexander Thielen; Susanne Kolbe-Busch; Klaus Göbels; Rainer Zotz; Klaus Pfeffer; Jörg Timm; Alexander T Dilthey; - German COVID-19 OMICS Initiative (DeCOI),https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251678,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251678,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,True
123,Optimal Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccines in the Philippines,"Vaccine allocation is a national concern especially for countries such as the Philippines that have limited resources in acquiring COVID-19 vaccines. As such, certain groups are suggested to be prioritized for vaccination to protect the most vulnerable before vaccinating others. Our model suggests an allocation of vaccines such that COVID-19 deaths are minimized while the prioritization framework is satisfied. Results of the model show that a vaccine coverage of at least 50 to 70% of the population can be enough for a community with limited supplies, and an increase in vaccine supply is beneficial if initial coverage is less than the specified target range. Also, among the vaccines considered in the study, the one with 89.9% effectiveness and has a 183 Philippine peso (Php) price per dose projected the least number of deaths.

124,"A disproportionate epidemic: COVID-19 cases and deaths among essential workers in Toronto, Canada","Shelter-in-place mandates and closure of non-essential businesses have been central to COVID-19 response strategies including in Toronto, Canada. Approximately half of the working population in Canada are employed in occupations that do not allow for remote work suggesting potentially limited impact of some of the strategies proposed to mitigate COVID-19 acquisition and onward transmission risks and associated morbidity and mortality. We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases (N=74,477) and deaths (N=2319), and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers. Findings suggest that the population who continued to serve the essential needs of society throughout COVID-19 shouldered a disproportionate burden of transmission and deaths.

125,COVID-19 Associated Stroke--A Single Centre Experience,"Background and PurposeVarious neurological complications have been reported in association with COVID-19. We report our experience of COVID-19 with stroke at a single center over a period of eight months spanning 1 March to 31 October 2020.

MethodsWe recruited all patients admitted to Internal Medicine with an acute stroke, who also tested positive for COVID-19 on RTPCR. We included all stroke cases in our analysis for prediction of in-hospital mortality, and separately analyzed arterial infarcts for vascular territory of ischemic strokes.

ResultsThere were 62 stroke cases among 3923 COVID-19 admissions (incidence 1.6%). Data was available for 58 patients {mean age 52.6 years; age range 17-91; F/M=20/38; 24% (14/58) aged [&le;]40; 51% (30/58) hypertensive; 36% (21/58) diabetic; 41% (24/58) with O2 saturation <95% at admission; 32/58 (55.17 %) in-hospital mortality}. Among 58 strokes, there were 44 arterial infarcts, seven bleeds, three arterial infarcts with associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, two combined infarct and bleed, and two of indeterminate type. Among the total 49 infarcts, Carotid territory was the commonest affected (36/49; 73.5%), followed by vertebrobasilar (7/49; 14.3%) and both (6/49; 12.2%). Concordant arterial block was seen in 61% (19 of 31 infarcts with angiography done).  Early stroke (within 48 hours of respiratory symptoms) was seen in 82.7% (48/58) patients. Patients with poor saturation at admission were older (58 vs 49 years) and had more comorbidities and higher mortality (79% vs 38%). Mortality was similar in young strokes and older patients, although the latter required more intense respiratory support.

126,Excess Mortality in Suicide caused by COVID-19 in Japan,"BackgroundCountermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdown and voluntary restrictions against going out adversely affect human stress and economic activity. Particularly, this stress might lead to suicide.

ObjectWe examined excess mortality attributable to suicide caused by COVID-19.

MethodWe applied the NIID model to suicide deaths from October 2009 through September, 2020 for the whole of Japan for both genders. Effects of the great earthquake that struck in eastern Japan on March 11, 2011 were incorporated into the estimation model.

ResultsSignificant excess mortality in suicide was found in July, August and September in 2020 for both genders. It was greater among females than among males. In total, 810 excess cases of mortality were identified.

Discussion and ConclusionExcess mortality during the two months was 1.4 times greater than the number of COVID-19 deaths confirmed by PCR testing.

127,Development and validation of a dynamic 48-hour in-hospital prognostic risk stratification for COVID-19 in a UK teaching hospital: a retrospective cohort study,"We propose a prognostic dynamic risk stratification for 48-hour in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, using demographics and routinely-collected observations and laboratory tests: age, Clinical Frailty Scale score, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2 ratio, white cell count, acidosis (pH < 7.35) and Interleukin-6. We train and validate the model using data from a UK teaching hospital, adopting a landmarking approach that accounts for competing risks and informative missingness. Internal validation of the model on the first wave of patients presenting between March 1 and September 12, 2020 achieves an AUROC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.93). Temporal validation on patients presenting between September 13, 2020 and January 1, 2021 gives an AUROC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.95).

128,"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey Among District Residents Presenting for Serologic Testing at Three Community Based Test Sites in Washington, DC, July to August, 2020","BackgroundThe District of Columbia (DC), a major metropolitan area, continues to see community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. While serologic testing does not indicate current SARS-CoV-2 infection, it can indicate prior infection and help inform local policy and health guidance. The DC Department of Health (DC Health) conducted a community-based survey to estimate DCs SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and identify seropositivity-associated factors.

MethodsA mixed-methods cross-sectional serology survey was conducted among a convenience sample of DC residents during July 27-August 21, 2020. Free serology testing was offered at three public test sites. Participants completed an electronic questionnaire on household and demographic characteristics, COVID-like illness (CLI) since January 1, 2020, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 exposures. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted to describe the sample population and assess factors associated with seropositivity.

ResultsAmong a sample of 671 participants, 51 individuals were seropositive, yielding an estimated seroprevalence of 7.6%. More than half (56.9%) of the seropositive participants reported no prior CLI; nearly half (47.1%) had no prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. Race/ethnicity, prior SARS-CoV-2 testing, prior CLI, employment status, and contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were associated with seropositivity (P<0.05). Among those reporting prior CLI, loss of taste or smell, duration of CLI, fewer days between CLI and serology test, or prior viral test were associated with seropositivity (P[&le;]0.006).

ConclusionsThese findings indicate many seropositive individuals reported no symptoms consistent with CLI since January or any prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. This underscores the potential for cases to go undetected in the community and suggests wider-spread transmission than previously reported in DC.

What is already known on this subject?Traditional case-based detection and syndromic surveillance efforts might not identify mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. This is particularly true among people in the general population who do not have increased risk of severe illness or might not be tested otherwise. Consequently, the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infections might not be known.

What this study adds?A community-based seroprevalence survey conducted in Washington, DC, during July 27-August 21, 2020 estimated that 7.6% of the convenience sample had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating prior infection. At the time of this survey, most of the participants reported that they had not been previously infected with or tested for SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight both the value of serologic surveillance in complementing other surveillance methods, and the importance of continued prevention and mitigation measures, such as maintaining physical distances of at least 6 feet, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, practicing frequent hand hygiene, and wearing face masks properly and consistently around people who do not live with you.",Adrienne Sherman; Jacqueline Reuben; Naomi S David; Delores P Quasie-Woods; Jayleen K.

129,Mapping of SARS-CoV-2 Brain Invasion and Histopathology in COVID-19 Disease,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) causes acute respiratory distress, termed COVID-19 disease, with substantial morbidity and mortality. As SCV2 is related to previously-studied coronaviruses that have been shown to have the capability for brain invasion, it seems likely that SCV2 may be able to do so as well. To date, although there have been many clinical and autopsy-based reports that describe a broad range of SCV2-associated neurological conditions, it is unclear what fraction of these have been due to direct CNS invasion versus indirect effects caused by systemic reactions to critical illness. Still critically lacking is a comprehensive tissue-based survey of the CNS presence and specific neuropathology of SCV2 in humans. We conducted an extensive neuroanatomical survey of RT-PCR-detected SCV2 in 16 brain regions from 20 subjects who died of COVID-19 disease. Targeted areas were those with cranial nerve nuclei, including the olfactory bulb, medullary dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the pontine trigeminal nerve nuclei, as well as areas possibly exposed to hematogenous entry, including the choroid plexus, leptomeninges, median eminence of the hypothalamus and area postrema of the medulla. Subjects ranged in age from 38 to 97 (mean 77) with 9 females and 11 males. Most subjects had typical age-related neuropathological findings. Two subjects had severe neuropathology, one with a large acute cerebral infarction and one with hemorrhagic encephalitis, that was unequivocally related to their COVID-19 disease while most of the 18 other subjects had non-specific histopathology including focal {beta}-amyloid precursor protein white matter immunoreactivity and sparse perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing. Four subjects (20%) had SCV2 RNA in one or more brain regions including the olfactory bulb, amygdala, entorhinal area, temporal and frontal neocortex, dorsal medulla and leptomeninges. The subject with encephalitis was SCV2-positive in a histopathologically-affected area, the entorhinal cortex, while the subject with the large acute cerebral infarct was SCV2-negative in all brain regions. Like other human coronaviruses, SCV2 can inflict acute neuropathology in susceptible patients. Much remains to be understood, including what viral and host factors influence SCV2 brain invasion and whether it is cleared from the brain subsequent to the acute illness.",Geidy E Serrano; Jessica E.

Given the ongoing vaccine rollout to healthcare personnel and residents of long-term care facilities, here we provide a preliminary assessment of real-world vaccination efficacy in 62,138 individuals from the Mayo Clinic and associated health system (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin) between December 1st 2020 and February 8th 2021. Our retrospective analysis contrasts 31,069 individuals receiving at least one dose of either vaccine with 31,069 unvaccinated individuals who are propensity-matched based on demographics, location (zip code), and number of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. 8,041 individuals received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and were at risk for infection at least 36 days after their first dose. Administration of two COVID-19 vaccine doses was 88.7% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%) with onset at least 36 days after the first dose. Furthermore, vaccinated patients who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 had significantly lower 14-day hospital admission rates than propensity-matched unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relative Risk: 0.4; p-value: 0.007).

131,Circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity,"Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of globally circulating variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 48 sera from BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients against pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins derived from 10 strains of SARS-CoV-2. While multiple strains exhibited vaccine-induced cross-neutralization comparable to wild-type pseudovirus, 5 strains harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was weak and comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.",Wilfredo F.

132,Artificial Intelligence Applications for COVID-19 in Intensive Care and Emergency Settings: A Systematic Review,"BackgroundLittle is known about the role of artificial intelligence (AI) as a decisive technology in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. We aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the current evidence on AI applications for COVID-19 in intensive care and emergency settings, focusing on methods, reporting standards, and clinical utility.

MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases from inception to 1 October 2020, without language restrictions. We included peer-reviewed original studies that applied AI for COVID-19 patients, healthcare workers, or health systems in intensive care, emergency or prehospital settings. We assessed predictive modelling studies using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) and a modified TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) statement for AI. We critically appraised the methodology and key findings of all other studies.

ResultsOf fourteen eligible studies, eleven developed prognostic or diagnostic AI predictive models, all of which were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Common pitfalls included inadequate sample sizes, poor handling of missing data, failure to account for censored participants, and weak validation of models. Studies had low adherence to reporting guidelines, with particularly poor reporting on model calibration and blinding of outcome and predictor assessment. Of the remaining three studies, two evaluated the prognostic utility of deep learning-based lung segmentation software and one studied an AI-based system for resource optimisation in the ICU. These studies had similar issues in methodology, validation, and reporting.

133,Quantification of the tradeoff between test sensitivity and test frequency in COVID-19 epidemic - a multi-scale modeling approach,"Control strategies that employ real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic are inefficient in fighting the epidemic due to high cost, delays in obtaining results, and the need of specialized personnel and equipment for laboratory processing. Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 57% to as low as 1.5% half a year into the outbreak and to 3.2% three years into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third. Our results predict that surveillance testing that employs low-sensitivity tests at high frequency is an effective tool for epidemic control.",Jonathan E Forde; Stanca M.

Here, we studied nasal and systemic immune parameters in comprehensively characterised patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and healthy community controls. PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants were more likely to receive dexamethasone and a beta-lactam antibiotic, and more likely to survive to hospital discharge than PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-/IgG- participants. PCR-/IgG+ participants exhibited a nasal and systemic cytokine signature analogous to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants, but had an increased propensity for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation. The nasal immune signature in PCR-/IgG+ and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants was distinct and predominated by chemokines and neutrophils.

AimThis study aims to estimate the risk of exposure for COVID-19 across Primary Healthcare workers in the State of Qatar. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted to study the burden of COVID-19 among staff working at PHCC during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 1 to October 31, 2020.

Results1,048 (87.4%)of the infected HCWs belonged to the age group below 45 years, and 488 (40.7%) HCWs were females. 450 (37.5%) were HCWs clinical staff working in one of the 27 PHCC HCs; Despite the increased patient footfall and risk environment, the COVID HCs had an attack rate of 10.1%, which is not significantly different from the average attack rate of 8.9% among staff located in other HCs (p-value =0.26). Storekeepers, engineering & maintenance staff, housekeeping staff, support staff, and security staff (outsourced positions) had the highest positivity rates, 100%, 67.2%, 47.1%, 32.4%, and 29.5% respective positivity rates.

ConclusionsThe elevated risk of infection amongst outsourced healthcare workers can be explained by environmental factors such as living conditions.

136,Immune characterization and profiles of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing mortality rates of COVID-19 create an urgent need for treatments, which are currently lacking. Although vaccines have been approved by the FDA for emergency use in the U.S., patients will continue to require pharmacologic intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality as vaccine availability remains limited. The rise of new variants makes the development of therapeutic strategies even more crucial to combat the current pandemic and future outbreaks. Evidence from several studies suggests the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Consequently, host immune factors are becoming more recognized as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. To develop therapeutic strategies to combat current and future coronavirus outbreaks, understanding how the coronavirus hijacks the host immune system during and after the infection is crucial. In this study, we investigated immunological patterns or characteristics of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed large bulk RNASeq and single cell RNAseq data from COVID-19 patient samples to immunoprofile differentially expressed gene sets and analyzed pathways to identify human host protein targets. We observed an immunological profile of severe COVID-19 patients characterized by upregulated cytokines, interferon-induced proteins, and pronounced T cell lymphopenia, supporting findings by previous studies. We identified a number of host immune targets including PERK, PKR, TNF, NF-kB, and other key genes that modulate the significant pathways and genes identified in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified genes modulated by COVID-19 infection that are implicated in oncogenesis, including E2F7 and RB1, suggesting a mechanism by which cancer may arise in patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Further clinical investigation of these targets may lead to bonafide therapeutic strategies to treat the current COVID-19 pandemic and protect against future outbreaks and viral escape variants.",Martine Policard; Sidharth Jain; Samantha Rego; Sivanesan Dakshanamurthy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431721,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431721,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
137,Alzheimer's-like remodeling of neuronal ryanodine receptor in COVID-19,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 involves multiple organs including cardiovascular, pulmonary and central nervous system. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 infection afflicts diverse organ systems remains challenging1,2. Particularly vexing has been the problem posed by persistent organ dysfunction known as ""long COVID,"" which includes cognitive impairment3. Here we provide evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to activation of TGF-{beta} signaling and oxidative overload. One consequence is oxidation of the ryanodine receptor/calcium (Ca2+) release channels (RyR) on the endo/sarcoplasmic (ER/SR) reticuli in heart, lung and brains of patients who succumbed to COVID-19. This depletes the channels of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 causing them to leak Ca2+ which can promote heart failure4,5, pulmonary insufficiency 6 and cognitive and behavioral defects7-9. Ex-vivo treatment of heart, lung, and brain tissues from COVID-19 patients using a Rycal drug (ARM210)10 prevented calstabin2 loss and fixed the channel leak. Of particular interest is that neuropathological pathways activated downstream of leaky RyR2 channels in Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients were activated in COVID-19 patients. Thus, leaky RyR2 Ca2+ channels may play a role in COVID-19 pathophysiology and could be a therapeutic target for amelioration of some comorbidities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Andrew R Marks; Haikel Dridi; Steven Reiken; Xiaoping Liu; Leah Sittenfeld,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431811,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431811,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
138,A Combination Adjuvant for the Induction of Potent Antiviral Immune Responses for a Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Protein Vaccine,"Several promising vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have received emergency use authorization in various countries and are being administered to the general population. However, many issues associated with the vaccines and the protection they provide remain unresolved, including the duration of conferred immunity, whether or not sterilizing immunity is imparted, and the degree of cross-variant protection that is achieved with these vaccines. Early evidence has suggested potentially reduced vaccine efficacy towards certain viral variants in circulation. Development of adjuvants compatible with these vaccine platforms that enhance the immune response and guide the adaptive and cellular immune responses towards the types of responses most effective for broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 will likely be pivotal for complete protection. Natural viral infection stimulates strong immune responses through the activation of three main pathways involving Toll-, RIG-I-, and NOD-like receptors (TLRs, RLRs, NLRs). As induction of appropriate innate responses is crucial for long-lasting adaptive immunity and for shaping the correct types of immune responses, we developed a combination, intranasal, adjuvant integrating a nanoemulsion-based adjuvant (NE) that activates TLRs and NLRP3 with an RNA agonist of RIG-I (IVT DI). This rationally designed combination adjuvant yielded a synergistic immune response with highly robust humoral and cellular responses towards SARS-CoV-2 using a recombinant spike protein S1 subunit antigen. Significantly enhanced virus neutralizing antibody titers were achieved towards both a homologous SARS-CoV-2 virus (IC50 titers of 1:104) and a mouse-adapted variant containing the N501Y mutation present in the B1.1.7 UK and B.1.351 South Africa variants. Importantly, NE/IVT DI dramatically enhanced the TH1-biased cellular response, which is expected to provide more durable and tailored cellular immunity while avoiding potential vaccine enhanced pathology previously associated with TH2-biased responses in some SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines. Our previous work with the NE/IVT DI adjuvant has demonstrated its compatibility with a broad range of antigen types. Thus, this combined adjuvant approach has strong potential for improving the induced immune profile for a variety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates such that better protection against future drift variants and prevention of transmission can be achieved.",Sonia Jangra; Jeffrey J Landers; Raveen Rathnasinghe; Katarzyna W Janczak; Marilia Cascalho; Andrew A Kennedy; Andrew W Tai; James R Baker Jr.; Michael Schotsaert; Pamela T Wong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431484,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431484,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False

Most SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target the receptor binding domain (RBD) and some the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein, which is the major antigen of SARS-CoV-2. While the antibody response to RBD has been extensively characterized, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the NTD protein are less well studied. Using 227 plasma samples from COVID-19 patients, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NTD-specific antibodies could be induced during infection. As compared to the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 NTD response is less cross-reactive with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies are rarely elicited in a mice model when NTD is used as an immunogen. We subsequently demonstrate that NTD has an altered antigenicity when expressed alone. Overall, our results suggest that while NTD offers an alternative strategy for serology testing, it may not be suitable as an immunogen for vaccine development.",Huibin Lv; Owen Tak-Yin Tsang; Ray T.

A 2A translational element was used to drive separate expression of NSP3 and the S product. rSA11 viruses were recovered that encoded the S-protein S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended receptor-binding domain (ExRBD), and S2 core (CR) domain (rSA11/NSP3-fS1, -fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR, respectively). Generation of rSA11/fS1 required a foreign-sequence insertion of 2.2-kbp, the largest such insertion yet made into the rotavirus genome. Based on isopycnic centrifugation, rSA11 containing S sequences were denser than wildtype virus, confirming the capacity of the rotavirus to accommodate larger genomes. Immunoblotting showed that rSA11/-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR viruses expressed S products of expected size, with fExRBD expressed at highest levels. These rSA11 viruses were genetically stable during serial passage. In contrast, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 failed to express its expected 80-kDa fS1 product, for unexplained reasons. Moreover, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 was genetically unstable, with variants lacking the S1 insertion appearing during serial passage. Nonetheless, these results emphasize the potential usefulness of rotavirus vaccines as expression vectors of portions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (e.g., NTD, RBD, ExRBD, and CR) with sizes smaller than the S1 fragment.

ImportanceAmong the vaccines administered to children in the US and many other countries are those targeting rotavirus, a segmented double-stranded RNA virus that is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis. In this study, we have examined the feasibility of modifying the rotavirus genome by reverse genetics, such that the virus could serve as an expression vector of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Results were obtained showing that recombinant rotaviruses can be generated that express domains of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein, including the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a common target of neutralizing antibodies produced in individuals infected by the virus. Our findings raise the possibility of creating a combined rotavirus-COVID-19 vaccine that could be used in place of current rotavirus vaccines.",Asha A Philip; John T Patton,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431835,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431835,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
141,Meta-analysis of orthogonal OMICs data from COVID-19 patients unveils prognostic markers and antiviral factors.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has lasted more than a year since its first case in December 2019 and yet its social and economic burden continues to grow. While a tremendous amount of OMICs data has been generated from COVID-19 patient samples, the host antiviral response and markers of disease progression remain to be completely delineated. In this study, we have conducted a meta-analysis of published transcriptome and proteome profiles of the nasal swab and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples of COVID-19 patients to identify high confidence upregulated host factors. This was followed by rank ordering, shortlisting, and validation of overexpression of a set of host factors in a nasal swab/BALF samples from a cohort of COVID-19 positive/negative, symptomatic/asymptomatic individuals. This led to the identification of host antiviral response in the upper respiratory tract and potential prognostic markers. Notably, SEPRIN B3 and Thioredoxin were identified as potential antiviral factors. In addition, several S100 family proteins were found to be upregulated in COVID-19 specific and disease severity dependent manner. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the host antiviral mechanisms and COVID-19 disease progression.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431825,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.431825,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
142,SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein dually regulates innate immune responses,"The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, may trigger immunosuppression in the early stage and a cytokine storm in the late stage of infection, however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein dually regulated innate immune responses, i.e., the low-dose N protein suppressed type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and inflammatory cytokines, whereas high-dose N protein promoted IFN-I signaling and inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein interacted with the tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), thereby dually regulating the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, STAT1 and STAT2. Additionally, low-dose N protein combined with TRIM25 could suppress retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) ubiquitination and activation. Our findings revealed a regulatory mechanism of innate immune responses by the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, which would contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like coronaviruses, and development of more effective strategies for controlling COVID-19.",Yinghua Zhao; Liyan Sui; Ping Wu; Wenfang Wang; Guangyun Tan; Zedong Wang; Yang Yu; Zhijun Hou; Guoqing Wang; Quan Liu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431755,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431755,2021-02-18,2021-02-18,,False
143,A glimpse into the diverse cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific cellular immune response may prove to be essential for long-term immune protection against the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To assess COVID-19-specific immunity in the population, we synthesized selected peptide pools of SARS-CoV-2 structural and functional proteins, including Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as target antigens. Survey of the T cell precursur frequencies in healthy individuals specific to these viral antigens demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was further confirmed by in vitro induction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses using dendritic cell (DC)/T cell coculture, which supported the corresponding T cell precursor frequencies in each of the individuals tested. In general, the combination of all five viral antigen pools induced the strongest cellular immune response, yet individual donors responded differently to different viral antigens. Importantly, in vitro restimulation of the T cells with the DC-peptides induced increased anti-viral immune responses in all individuals even in the no responders, suggesting that repeated antigen stimulation could elicit a broad protection in immune naive population. Our analysis recapitulates the critical role of cellular immunity in fighting COVID-19 and the importance of analyzing anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell response in addition to antibody response in the population.

ImportanceFacing the rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants in the world, current emphasis on antibody-producing vaccines needs a quick revisit. The virus-specific cellular immunity may prove to be essential for long-term protection against COVID-19. This study designed a series of antigenic peptides encompassing the conserved and/or essential domains of Spike (S), Membrane (M), envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as targets to assess Covid-19-specific immunity in the population. The results demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was verified by in vitro generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cells from these subjects. The study suggested that individuals responded differently to the different viral antigens, and importantly, repeated stimulation could produce virus specific T cells in all individuals, including the no responders.

144,Retrospective study of the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain: analysis of counterfactual scenarios,"One of the most important questions on the COVID-19 pandemic is ascertaining the correct timing to introduce non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), based mainly on mobility restrictions, to control the rising of the daily incidence in a specific territory. Here, we make a retrospective analysis of the first wave of the epidemic in Spain and provide a set of useful insights to optimize actions in the near future. We have reconstructed the exposure times, from infection to detectability, to correctly estimate the reproduction number Rt. This enables us to analyze counterfactual scenarios to understand the impact of earlier or later responses, decoupling containment measures from natural immunity. Our results quantify the differences in the number of fatalities for earlier and later responses to the epidemic in Spain.

145,Accuracy of Smartphone Integrated Pulse Oximetry Meets Full FDA Clearance Standards for Clinical Use.,"BackgroundPulse oximetry is used as an assessment tool to gauge the severity of COVID-19 infection and identify patients at risk of poor outcomes. 1,2,3,4 The pandemic highlights the need for accurate pulse oximetry, particularly at home, as infection rates increase in multiple global regions including the UK, USA and South Africa 5. Over 100 million Samsung smartphones containing dedicated biosensors (Maxim Integrated Inc, San Jose, CA) and preloaded Apps to perform pulse oximetry, are in use globally. We performed detailed in human hypoxia testing on the Samsung S9 smartphone to determine if this integrated hardware meets full FDA/ISO requirements for clinical pulse oximetry.

MethodsThe accuracy of integrated pulse oximetry in the Samsung 9 smartphone during stable arterial oxygen saturations (SaO2) between 70% and 100% was evaluated in 12 healthy subjects. Inspired oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide partial pressures were monitored and adjusted via a partial rebreathing circuit to achieve stable target SaO2 plateaus between 70% and 100%. Arterial blood samples were taken at each plateau and saturation measured on each blood sample using ABL-90FLEX blood gas analyzer. Bias, calculated from smartphone readings minus the corresponding arterial blood sample, was reported as root mean square deviation (RMSD).

FindingsThe RMSD of the over 257 data points based on blood sample analysis obtained from 12 human volunteers tested was 2.6%.

InterpretationEvaluation of the smartphone pulse oximeter performance is within requirements of <3.5% RMSD blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) value for FDA/ISO clearance for clinical pulse oximetry. This is the first report of smartphone derived pulse oximetry measurements that meet full FDA/ISO accuracy certification requirements. Both Samsung S9 and S10 contain the same integrated pulse oximeter, thus over 100 million smartphones in current global circulation could be used to obtain clinically accurate spot SpO2 measurements to support at home assessment of COVID-19 patients.",Sara H Browne; Mike Bernstein; Philip E.

146,"Moderators of changes in smoking, drinking, and quitting behaviour associated with the first Covid-19 lockdown in England","AimTo estimate changes in smoking, drinking, and quitting behaviour from before to during the first Covid-19 lockdown in England, and whether changes differed by age, sex, or social grade.

DesignRepresentative cross-sectional surveys of adults, collected monthly between August 2018 and July 2020.

SettingEngland.

Participants36,980 adults ([&ge;]18y).

MeasurementsIndependent variables were survey month (pre-lockdown: August-February vs. lockdown months: April-July) and year (pandemic: 2019/20 vs. comparator: 2018/19). Smoking outcomes were smoking prevalence, cessation, quit attempts, quit success, and use of evidence-based or remote cessation support. Drinking outcomes were high-risk drinking prevalence, alcohol reduction attempts, and use of evidence-based or remote support. Moderators were age, sex, and occupational social grade (ABC1=more advantaged/C2DE=less advantaged).

FindingsRelative to changes over the same time period in 2018/19, lockdown was associated with significant increases in smoking prevalence (+24.7% in 2019/20 vs. 0.0% in 2018/19, ORadj=1.35[95%CI=1.12-1.63]) and quit attempts (+39.9% vs. -22.2%, ORadj=2.48[1.76-3.50]) among 18-34 year-olds, but not older groups. Increases in cessation (+156.4% vs. -12.5%, ORadj=3.08[1.86-5.09]) and the success rate of quit attempts (+99.2% vs. +0.8%, ORadj=2.29[1.31-3.98]) were also observed, and did not differ significantly by age, sex, or social grade. Lockdown was associated with a significant increase in high-risk drinking prevalence across all sociodemographic groups (+39.5% vs. -7.8%, ORadj=1.80[1.64-1.98]), with particularly high increases among women (ORadj=2.17[1.87-2.53]) and social grades C2DE (ORadj=2.34[2.00-2.74]). Alcohol reduction attempts increased significantly among high-risk drinkers from social grades ABC1 (ORadj=2.31[1.78-3.00]) but not C2DE (ORadj=1.25[0.83-1.88]), with larger increases among those aged 18-34 (ORadj=2.56[1.72-3.81]) and [&ge;]60 (ORadj=1.43[1.05-1.95]) than 35-59 (ORadj=2.51[1.51-4.18]). There were few significant changes in use of support for smoking cessation or alcohol reduction, although samples were small.

ConclusionsIn England, the first Covid-19 lockdown was associated with increased smoking prevalence among younger adults, and increased high-risk drinking prevalence among all adults. Smoking cessation activity also increased: more younger smokers made quit attempts during lockdown and more smokers quit successfully. Socioeconomic disparities in drinking behaviour were evident: high-risk drinking increased by more among women and those from less advantaged social grades (C2DE) but the rate of reduction attempts increased only among the more advantaged social grades (ABC1).",Sarah E Jackson; Emma Beard; Colin Angus; Matt Field; Jamie Brown,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251766,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251766,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True
147,"Epidemiological, Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for Severe Condition and ICU Admission of COVID-19 Patients of Early Stage in China: A review","ObjectiveSome retrospective studies reporting epidemiological, clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients of early stage were published. We aim to provide an overview of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients, and identification, treatment of early stage, especially for the patients with poor prognosis.

Data SourcesPubMed, CNKI and Google Scholar.

Study SelectionWe searched for published retrospective studies that described epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 patients in China by April 14th, 2020 with search terms. Some studies were excluded according to criteria. Finally, 53 studies were included.

Data ExtractionCharacteristics of the COVID-19 patients available from included articles were extracted, reorganized and recorded into electronic data forms.

Data SynthesisCharacteristics of patients in the included studies were summarized and analyzed for median-interquartile ranges and univariable odds ratio.

ConclusionThis study summarized, analyzed and compared epidemiological, clinical characteristics and estimated univariable risk factors among confirmed COVID-19 patients either in former epicenter, in severe condition, with ICU admission or not of early stage. Higher proportions of patients were found to have older age and more comorbidities, typical characteristics on admission and complications either in former epicenter, with severe condition or ICU admission. No evidence showed that patients who were male or had smoking history had higher susceptibility, but they were significant risk factors for severe condition. Some self-implementable traditional Chinese medicine therapies conducted for immunity improvement, control of comorbidities and reduction of some medicine intake. Limited evidence revealed that some characteristics of the disease might be changing with human-to-human transmission, and more research, especially international collaboration, is needed.

148,Interrogating structural inequalities in COVID-19 Mortality in England and Wales,"BackgroundNumerous observational studies have highlighted structural inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in the UK. Such studies often fail to consider the complex spatial nature of such inequalities in their analysis, leading to the potential for bias and an inability to reach conclusions about the most appropriate structural levels for policy intervention.

MethodsWe use publicly available population data on COVID-19 related- and all-cause mortality between March and July 2020 in England and Wales to investigate the spatial scale of such inequalities. We propose a multiscale approach to simultaneously consider four spatial scales at which processes driving inequality may act and apportion inequality between these.

ResultsAdjusting for population age structure, number of care homes and residing in the North we find highest regional inequality in March and June/July. We find finer-grained within-region increased steadily from March until July. The importance of spatial context increases over the study period. No analogous pattern is visible for non-COVID mortality. Higher relative deprivation is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality at all stages of the pandemic but does not explain structural inequalities.

ConclusionsResults support initial stochastic viral introduction in the South, with initially high inequality decreasing before the establishment of regional trends by June and July, prior to reported regionality of the ""second-wave"". We outline how this framework can help identify structural factors driving such processes, and offer suggestions for a long-term, locally-targeted model of pandemic relief in tandem with regional support to buffer the social context of the area.

149,"Are we back to normal yet? The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health with a specific focus on schizotypal traits in the general population of Germany and the UK, comparing responses from April/May vs. September/October","Studies reported a strong impact on mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March-June, 2020. In this study, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on mental health in general and on schizoptypal traits specifically in general population samples of the UK (N 1st timepoint=239, N 2nd timepoint= 126) and Germany (N 1st timepoint= 543, N 2nd timepoint=401) over two timepoints, April/May and September/October 2020. We were able to show that whereas general psychological symptoms (global symptom index, GSI) and percentage of responders above clinical cut-off for further psychological investigation declined from the first to the second timepoint in both countries, schizotypy scores (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire) were increased at the second timepoint. We investigated potential predictors, using regression models. For schizotypy, we detected a doubling or more of the estimated impact from the first to the second timepoint, including stronger perceived loneliness, increased use of drugs, stronger financial burden, and decreased regular exercise and sleep. These effects predicted GSI, however with a lower increase of impact from the first to the second timepoint. We furthermore found that living in the UK was a predictor for higher schizotypal scores or GSI. However, the results are highly comparable between the two countries. In conclusion, this study shows that while the general psychological impact decreases, potentially showing a normative response to an exceptional situation; schizotypy scores increase, revealing a stronger impact of loneliness, drug use, and financial burden. This development might create an increased risk for developing psychosis in some individuals.

150,Impacts of COVID-19 on long-term health and health care use,"AimTo explore impacts of mild and severe COVID-19 on acute and long-term utilization of primary care, inpatient- and outpatient specialist health care.

MethodsIn all persons tested for the SARS-CoV-2 in Norway March 1st to November 1st 2020 (N=1 257 831), we used a difference-in-differences design to contrast the monthly health care use before and after testing, across patients with negative test (no COVID-19) and 1) positive test, not hospitalized (mild COVID-19) and 2) positive test, hospitalized (severe COVID-19). We studied all-cause- and cause-specific health care use for digestive, circulatory, respiratory, endocrine/metabolic/nutritional, genitourinary, eye/ear, musculoskeletal, mental, skin, blood and general/unspecified conditions.

ResultsMild COVID-19 impacted on primary care due to respiratory conditions at 0-3 months after having tested positive (786% increase). Severe COVID-19 impacted on visits due to respiratory-(337-3316% increase), circulatory-(166-205% increase), endocrine/metabolic/nutritional-(168-791% increase) as well as visits due to general/unspecified conditions (48-431% increase) in outpatient and inpatient specialist care 0-3 months after being tested. Severe COVID-19 also impacted on outpatient specialist care after 4-6 months, for respiratory and circulatory conditions (199-246% increase) and general/unspecified conditions (40% increase).

ConclusionOur findings imply that mild COVID-19 does not persist to cause a need for health care beyond two months after having tested positive.

Convalescent plasma has been used to treat emerging infectious diseases -Influenza A/B, SARS-CoV, Ebola virus and now SARS-CoV 2.

OBJECTIVEThis study aims to determine the outcome and clinical course of COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma transfusion at Cardinal Santos Medical Center.

METHODSThis is a retrospective cohort analytical study of 75 patients who received convalescent plasma.

RESULTSMedian time from admission to CP transfusion was 3 days. Majority of patients received additional therapies including dexamethasone (100%); Remdesivir (95%); antibiotics (100%), tocilizumab (65%); hemoperfusion (88%) or combination of these. Among the survivors, the median LOS was 15 days while non-survivors have a median LOS of 6 days. One patient (1.33%) had mild transfusion reaction. Four patients (5.33%) developed DVT despite anti-coagulation. There was improvement in the inflammatory markers (LDH pvalue 0.04, CRP pvalue 0.00, Ferritin pvalue 0.0001). There was improvement in the pulmonary parameters -increase in mean PaO2, mean SaO2, and mean PFR; and decrease in mean FiO2 and mean RR post-treatment. Median LOS is 14 days for the CP group vs 11 days for the non-CP group. Mortality rate among the CP group is 25.33% while the non-CP group was 26.67%.

152,The efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials,"The novel coronavirus outbreak began in late December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, critically impacting public health systems. A number of already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid hub/PubMed, Scopus, ISI web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P=0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P=0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P=0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We should consider that perhaps the use of antiviral once the patient has symptoms is too late and this would explain their low efficacy in the clinical setting.",Soheil Hassanpour; Morteza Arab-Zozani; Bahman Amani; Forough Heidarzad; Mohammad Fathalipour; Rudolph Martinez-de-Hoyo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251693,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251693,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True

Here we use a data-driven model-inference approach to simulate the pandemic at county-scale in the United States during 2020 and estimate critical, time-varying epidemiological properties underpinning the dynamics of the virus. The pandemic in the US during 2020 was characterized by an overall ascertainment rate of 21.6% (95% credible interval (CI):18.9 - 25.5%). Population susceptibility at years end was 68.8% (63.4 - 75.3%), indicating roughly one third of the US population had been infected. Community infectious rates, the percentage of people harboring a contagious infection, rose above 0.8% (0.6 - 1.0%) before the end of the year, and were as high as 2.4% in some major metropolitan areas. In contrast, the infection fatality rate fell to 0.3% by years end; however, community control of transmission, estimated from trends of the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, slackened during successive pandemic waves. In the coming months, as vaccines are distributed and administered and new more transmissible virus variants emerge and spread, greater use of non-pharmaceutical interventions will be needed.",Sen Pei; Teresa K.

158,Should We Delay the Second COVID-19 Vaccine Dose?,"Due to the shortage in COVID-19 vaccine supplies and the alarming sanitary situation engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have opted to delay the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for some period of time, aiming at getting the first dose of the vaccine to a large number of the population, before proceeding with the second doses [7, 6]. This strategy has sparked some heated debates world-wide for its pros and cons, and no clear consensus is reached among experts [5, 3]. Without taking side in this matter, we tried to answer the following question, from a pure mathematical perspective: should we delay the second dose of the vaccine or not?. We show that the answer to this question depends tightly on the efficacy of the first and the second COVID-19 vaccine doses. In particular, if the first dose is more than 50% efficient, the optimal procedure to maximize the number of effectively vaccinated sub-population is to delay the second vaccine as much as possible (the maximum period between the two doses prescribed by the clinical recommendations). On the other hand, if the efficacy of the first dose is less than 50% and the efficacy of the second dose exceeds a certain threshold, then it would be optimal to administer the second dose as quickly as possible (while respecting the minimum period between the two does as prescribed by the clinical recommendations). We provide explicitly the expression of this threshold as a function of the efficacy of first dose.",Intissar Harizi; Soulaimane Berkane; Abdelhamid Tayebi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251652,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251652,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,True

Spearmans correlation coefficients were used for the statistical analysis. Results show that air temperature and wind speed were positively correlated with COVID-19 cases, while air relative humidity showed negative correlation. As seen in several recent studies, climate factors and the spread of COVID-19 seem to be related. Our study corroborates this hypothesis for less densely populated and less polluted regions. We hope that our findings help worldwide scientific efforts towards understanding this disease and how it spreads in different regions.

160,E484K mutation in SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhances binding affinity with hACE2 but reduces interactions with neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies: Binding free energy calculation studies,"The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 100 million infections and over 2 million deaths worldwide. The progress in the developments of effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics brings hopes to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have been emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by both the 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to more tight binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The more tight binding interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies, and the decrease in the binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies, indicating reduced effectiveness of these antibodies. Our results provide valuable information for the effective vaccine development and antibody drugs design.",Wei Bu Wang; Yu Liang; Yu Qin Jin; Jing Zhang; Ji Guo Su; Qi Ming Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431566,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431566,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
161,Association of CXCR6 with COVID-19 severity: Delineating the host genetic factors in transcriptomic regulation,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that mainly affects the host respiratory system with [~]80% asymptomatic or mild cases and [~]5% severe cases. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic loci associated with the severe COVID-19 symptoms. Delineating the genetic variants and genes is important for better understanding its biological mechanisms.

MethodsWe implemented integrative approaches, including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), colocalization analysis and functional element prediction analysis, to interpret the genetic risks using two independent GWAS datasets in lung and immune cells. To understand the context-specific molecular alteration, we further performed deep learning-based single cell transcriptomic analyses on a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) dataset from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.

ResultsWe discovered and replicated the genetically regulated expression of CXCR6 and CCR9 genes. These two genes have a protective effect on the lung and a risk effect on whole blood, respectively. The colocalization analysis of GWAS and cis-expression quantitative trait loci highlighted the regulatory effect on CXCR6 expression in lung and immune cells. In the lung resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells, we found a 3.32-fold decrease of cell proportion and lower expression of CXCR6 in the severe than moderate patients using the BALF transcriptomic dataset. Pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs were highlighted in TRM cells trajectory from moderate to severe patients.

ConclusionsCXCR6 from the 3p21.31 locus is associated with severe COVID-19. CXCR6 tends to have a lower expression in lung TRM cells of severe patients, which aligns with the protective effect of CXCR6 from TWAS analysis. We illustrate one potential mechanism of host genetic factor impacting the severity of COVID-19 through regulating the expression of CXCR6 and TRM cell proportion and stability.

The measles virus (MV)-vectored vaccine is an attractive candidate given the measles vaccines extensive safety history, well-established manufacturing process, and induction of strong, long-lasting immunity. We developed an MV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using either the full-length spike (S) or S2 subunit as the antigen. While the S2 antigen failed to induce neutralizing antibodies, the prefusion-stabilized, full-length S (MV-ATU2-SF-2P-dER) construct proved to be an attractive vaccine candidate, eliciting strong Th1-dominant T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses against the S antigen while minimizing reactivity to the vector itself.

163,A selective sweep in the Spike gene has driven SARS-CoV-2 human adaptation,"While SARS-CoV-2 likely has animal origins1, the viral genetic changes necessary to adapt this animal-derived ancestral virus to humans are largely unknown, mostly due to low levels of sequence polymorphism and the notorious difficulties in experimental manipulations of coronavirus genomes. We scanned more than 182,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for selective sweep signatures and found that a distinct footprint of positive selection is located around a non-synonymous change (A1114G; T372A) within the Receptor-Binding Domain of the Spike protein, which likely played a critical role in overcoming species barriers and accomplishing interspecies transmission from animals to humans. Structural analysis indicated that the substitution of threonine with an alanine in SARS-CoV-2 concomitantly removes a predicted glycosylation site at N370, resulting in more favorable binding predictions to human ACE2, the cellular receptor. Using a novel bacteria-free cloning system for manipulating RNA virus genomes, we experimentally validated that this SARS-CoV-2-unique substitution significantly increases replication in human cells relative to its putative ancestral variant. Notably, this mutations impact on virus replication in human cells was much greater than that of the Spike D614G mutant, which has been widely reported to have been selected for during human-to-human transmission2,3.",Lin Kang; Guijuan He; Amanda K.

164,Delayed induction of type I and III interferons and nasal epithelial cell permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2,"The nasal epithelium is a plausible entry point for SARS-CoV-2, a site of pathogenesis and transmission, and may initiate the host response to SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral interferon responses are critical to outcome of SARS-CoV-2. Yet little is known about the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity in this tissue. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics to a primary cell model of human primary nasal epithelium differentiated at air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated widespread tropism for nasal epithelial cell types. The host response was dominated by type I and III IFNs and interferon-stimulated gene products. Nevertheless, this response was notably delayed in onset compared to viral gene expression, and thus failed to impact substantially on SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, when provided prior to infection, recombinant IFN{beta} or IFN{lambda}1 induced an efficient antiviral state that potently restricted SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, preserving epithelial barrier integrity.

Vaccines that elicit protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs circulating in animals have the potential to prevent future betaCoV pandemics. Here, we show that immunization of macaques with a multimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) nanoparticle adjuvanted with 3M-052-Alum elicited cross-neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, batCoVs and the UK B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 mutant virus. Nanoparticle vaccination resulted in a SARS-CoV-2 reciprocal geometric mean neutralization titer of 47,216, and robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaque upper and lower respiratory tracts. Importantly, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric RBD protein also induced SARS-CoV-1 and batCoV cross-neutralizing antibodies, albeit at lower titers. These results demonstrate current mRNA vaccines may provide some protection from future zoonotic betaCoV outbreaks, and provide a platform for further development of pan-betaCoV nanoparticle vaccines.",Kevin O Saunders; Esther Lee; Robert Parks; David R Martinez; Dapeng Li; Haiyan Chen; Robert J Edwards; Sophie M.

Residues E484 and K417 in the receptor-binding site (RBS) are both mutated in lineages first described in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (B.1.1.28.1). The nAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2 patients are preferentially encoded by certain heavy-chain germline genes and the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2) can each bind the RBS in two different binding modes. However, their binding and neutralization are abrogated by either the E484K or K417N mutation, whereas nAbs to the cross-reactive CR3022 and S309 sites are largely unaffected.

167,A rigorous framework for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutational ensemble from genomic and structural features,"The recent release of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data from several countries has provided clues into the potential antigenic drift of the coronavirus population. In particular, the genomic instability observed in the spike protein necessitates immediate action and further exploration in the context of viral-host interactions. Here we dynamically track 3,11,795 genome sequences of spike protein, which comprises 2,584 protein mutations. We reveal mutational genomic ensemble at different timing and geographies, that evolves on four distinct residues. In addition to the well-established N501 mutational cluster, we detect the presence of three novel clusters, namely A222, N439, and S477. The robust examination of structural features from 44 known cryo-EM structures showed that the virus is deploying many mutations within these clusters on structurally heterogeneous regions. One such dominant variant D614G was also simulated using molecular dynamics simulations and, as compared to wild-type, we found higher stability with human ACE2 receptor. There is also a significant overlap of mutational clusters on known epitopes, indicating putative interference with antibody binding. Thus, we propose that the resulting coaxility of mutational clusters is the most efficient feature of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and provides precise mutant combinations that can enable future vaccine re-positioning.",Saman Fatihi; Surabhi Rathore; Ankit Pathak; Deepanshi Gahlot; Mitali Mukerji; Nidhi Jatana; Lipi Thukral,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431625,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.17.431625,2021-02-17,2021-02-17,,False
168,"Multiple Sites on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein are Susceptible to Proteolysis by Cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V","SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the viruss capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry.

169,How the replication and transcription complex of SARS-CoV-2 functions in leader-to-body fusion,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although unprecedented efforts are underway to develop therapeutic strategies against this disease, scientists have acquired only a little knowledge regarding the structures and functions of the CoV replication and transcription complex (RTC) and 16 non-structural proteins, named NSP1-16.

ResultsIn the present study, we determined the theoretical arrangement of NSP12-16 in the global RTC structure. This arrangement answered how the CoV RTC functions in the ""leader-to-body fusion"" process. More importantly, our results revealed the associations between multiple functions of the RTC, including RNA synthesis, NSP15 cleavage, RNA methylation, and CoV replication and transcription at the molecular level. As the most important finding, transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) hairpins were reported for the first time to help understand the multiple functions of CoV RTCs and the strong recombination abilities of CoVs.

ConclusionsTRS hairpins can be used to identify recombination regions in CoV genomes. We provide a systematic understanding of the structures and functions of the RTC, leading to the eventual determination of the global CoV RTC structure. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, providing a basis for future studies.

A previously developed thermodynamic model of protein conformations predicted that SARS CoV-2 is very close to a thermodynamic critical point, which makes it highly infectious but also easily displaced by a spike-based vaccine because there is a tradeoff between transmissibility and robustness2. The model identified a small cluster of four key mutations of SARS CoV-2 that promotes much stronger viral attachment and viral spreading.

We provide here a multi-omics framework to probe the molecular basis of a multicomponent example herb, Cissampelos pareira L. (Cipa) used in the treatment of hormonal disorders and fever in Ayurveda. Cipa treated MCF7 cells exhibit downregulation of signatures of estrogen response. 38 constituent molecules in Cipa potentially bind ({triangleup}G< -7.5) with ER at the same site as estrogen. Cipa transcriptome signatures in the connectivity map exhibit positive scores with protein translation inhibitors and knockdown signatures of genes linked to the antiviral response. This includes the knockdown signature of RPL7, a coactivator of ESRI with a connectivity score > 99.92. This axis was found to be upregulated in the COVID-19 patient transcriptome. The antiviral activity through ESR1 modulation was validated in the DENV-2 infection model. We further observed 98% inhibition of SARs-COV-2 replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract.

172,Potent neutralization antibodies induced by a recombinant trimeric Spike protein vaccine candidate containing PIKA adjuvant for COVID-19,"Neutralizing antibodies are critical to prevent corona virus infection. The structures of immunogens to elicit most potent neutralization antibodies are still under investigation. Here we tested the immunogenicity of the trimeric, full length Spike protein with 2 proline mutations to preserve its prefusion conformation. Recombinant trimeric Spike protein expressed by CHO cells was used with polyI:C (PIKA) adjuvant to immunize mice by 0-7-14 day schedule. The results showed that Spike-specific antibody was induced at day 21 with titer of more than 50,000 in average as measured by direct binding to Spike protein. The titer of neutralization reached more than 1000 in average when tested by a pseudo-virus system, using monoclonal antibodies (40592-MM57 and 40591-MM43) with neutralizing IC50 at 1 g/ml as standards. Protein/peptide array showed that the antibodies induced by trimeric S protein vaccine bind similarly to natural infection with the receptor binding domain (RBD) as major immunodominant region. No linear epitopes were found in RBD, although several linear epitopes were found in C-terminal domain right after RBD, and heptad repeat regions.

173,Community end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Initial findings of a UK primary care survey,"BackgroundThousands of people in the UK have required end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary healthcare teams (general practice and community nursing services) have provided the majority of this care, alongside specialist colleagues. There is a need to learn from this experience in order to inform future service delivery and planning.

AimTo understand the views of general practitioners and community nurses providing end-of-life care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design and SettingA web-based, UK-wide questionnaire survey circulated via professional general practice and community nursing networks during September and October 2020.

MethodResponses were analysed using descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic analysis.

ResultsValid responses were received from 559 individuals (387 community nurses, 156 General Practitioners (GPs) and 16 unspecified role), from all regions of the UK. The majority reported increased involvement in providing community end-of-life care. Contrasting and potentially conflicting roles emerged between GPs and community nurses. There was increased use of remote consultations, particularly by GPs. Community nurses took greater responsibility in most aspects of end-of-life care practice, particularly face-to-face care, but reported feeling isolated. For some GPs and community nurses, there has been considerable emotional distress.

ConclusionPrimary healthcare services are playing a critical role in meeting increased need for end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have adapted rapidly, but the significant emotional impact, especially for community nurses, needs addressing alongside rebuilding trusting and supportive team dynamics.

174,Workplace measures against COVID-19 during the winter third wave in Japan: company size-based differences,"ObjectivesLittle is known about workplace measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan after the first state of emergency period, especially in micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). This study aimed to provide an overview of the current situation of anti-COVID-19 measures in Japanese enterprises, considering company size.

MethodsThis study was an Internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study. Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020 during the third wave of COVID-19. The chi-squared test for trend was performed to calculate the p-value for trend for each workplace measure across company sizes.

ResultsFor the 27,036 participants, across company sizes, the most prevalent workplace measure was encouraging mask wearing at work, followed by requesting that employees refrain from going to work when ill and restricting work-related social gatherings and entertainment. These measures were implemented by approximately 90% of large-scale enterprises and by more than 40% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. In contrast, encouraging remote working and restricting eating and drinking at personal workspaces were implemented by less than half of large-scale enterprises and by around 15% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. There were statistically significant differences in all workplace measures by company size (all p-values < .001).

ConclusionsWe found that various responses to COVID-19 had been taken in workplaces. However, some measures, including remote working, were still not well implemented, especially in smaller enterprises. The findings suggest that occupational health support for MSMEs is urgently needed to mitigate the current wave of COVID-19.",Tomohiro Ishimaru; Masako Nagata; Ayako Hino; Satoshi Yamashita; Seiichiro Tateishi; Mayumi Tsuji; Akira Ogami; Shinya Matsuda; Yoshihisa Fujino,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251716,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251716,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
175,An alternative approach for bioanalytical assay development for wastewater-based epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2,"Wastewater-based epidemiology could be applied to track down SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at high spatio-temporal resolution and could potentially be used as an early-warning for emergence of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the general population. Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in monitoring the spread of the virus in the population and controlling possible outbreaks. However, sensitive sample preparation and detection methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW).

Unlike predecessors, method development of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 loads (in combination with seeding IWW with a surrogate coronavirus). This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been subject to in-sewer degradation into smaller genome fragments or might be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris,...). Centricon Plus-70 (100 kDa) centrifugal filter devices resulted in the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Lowering pore sizes did not improve our limit of detection and quantification. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E_Sarbeco-gene.

This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. Interestingly, qPCR results were comparable with dPCR results suggesting that qPCR is a valid method. In this study, dPCR was also used as a proxy to assess the precision of qPCR. In this light, dPCR showed high variability at low concentration levels (100 copies/{micro}L), indicating that variability in bioanalytical assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA might be substantial.

On average, the N2-gene showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 {degrees}C. Between-sample variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene proved to be less stable compared to the N2-gene and showed higher variability. Freezing the IWW samples resulted in a 10-fold decay of loads of the N2- and E-gene in IWW.

Although WBE can already aid in filling some knowledge gaps in the epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, future WBE studies should aim to further validate and standardize bioanalytical assays, especially with regards to methodological limitations.

176,"Responsive caregiving, opportunities for early learning, and children's safety and security during COVID-19: A rapid review","IntroductionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been drastic changes in family life and programs and services that promote and protect early childhood development. Global stakeholders have raised concerns that the pandemic is putting enormous strain on parents and other caregivers, compromising capabilities and enabling environments for nurturing care of young children and therefore likely impacting childrens development.

MethodologyThis rapid review takes stock of emerging research on nurturing care for young children during the COVID-19 crisis. Two databases were searched in addition to an extensive search for grey literature, drawing on 112 scholarly and scientific studies from more than 30 countries that have examined components of nurturing care during the pandemic, namely: responsive caregiving, early learning and play, and childrens safety and security.

ResultsThere are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the pandemic on families, including increased father involvement in caregiving. But more commonly, the studies findings reveal numerous issues of concern, including parental and caregiver mental health difficulties and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. Evidence suggests limited access and challenges in the provision of remote learning for the youngest learners, such as those in early childhood education.

ConclusionThe findings can inform global stakeholders, who have advocated for increased support and funding to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for action-oriented implementation studies - those that go beyond identifying trends and begin to pinpoint ""what works"" to effectively promote and protect nurturing care during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSThe most fundamental promotive experiences in the early years of life to reach optimal development come from nurturing care and protection received from parents, family, and community, which have lifelong benefits including improved health and wellbeing. Health and other emergencies are detrimental to the provision of nurturing care.

What are the new findings?Findings from this rapid review reveal numerous areas of concern, including families reporting mental health difficulties and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. As with other features of this pandemic, not all families are affected equally: financially vulnerable families are much more likely to experience negative ramifications. The pandemic is also disproportionately affecting parents and other caregivers with young children, particularly mothers, those with pre-existing mental health difficulties, and those caring for children with disabilities.

What do the new findings imply?Findings highlight the need for action by governments, civil society, international and community-based organizations to improve support for families so that the pandemic does not break the provision of nurturing care and wipe out decades of progress, especially for vulnerable families and children.",Kerrie Proulx; Rachel Lenzi-Weisbecker; Rachel Rachel; Kristy Hackett; Vanessa Cavallera; Bernadette Daelmans; Tarun Dua,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251507,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251507,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
177,Fear and death anxiety among Latin American doctors during the Covid-19 pandemic,"IntroductionA patients death elicits various feelings arise in doctors such as impotence and guilt that could trigger physical or psychological symptoms. Despite its impact, few studies have explored anxiety and fear of death among physicians.

ObjectiveTo evaluate perceptions and responses to ones mortality among Latin American physicians treating COVID-19 patients.

MethodologyThis cross-sectional study utilized the Collet-Lester Modified Fear of Death Scale and the Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) to collect data from physicians in Latin America.

Results219 doctors from Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Bolivia filled out the online questionnaire. Fear of death among the sample population ranged from 56.2% to 90%. Furthermore, the prevalence of ""High Anxiety"" was 80.8%. A statistically significant association was found between fear according to age and time of graduation (p = 0.010 and p = 0.020, respectively). No differences were found by gender, age, and country of origin or practice.

ConclusionPhysicians experience feelings of helplessness and guilt upon the death of a patient and those feelings can trigger physical or psychological symptoms. For these states of fear and anxiety about death, more frequent in times of pandemic, doctors must be prepared, and institutions must provide them with the necessary means to help them overcome these difficult times.",Sonia Indacochea; Jenny Raquel Torres-Malca; Victor Juan Vera-Ponce; Miguel A.

178,A multi-centre service evaluation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation of newly diagnosed cancers and type 1 diabetes in children in the UK,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in patterns of presentation to Emergency Departments (ED). Child health professionals were concerned that this could contribute to the delayed diagnosis of life-threatening conditions, including childhood cancer (CC) and type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Our multicentre, UK-based service evaluation assessed diagnostic intervals and disease severity for these conditions.

MethodsWe collected presentation route, timing and disease severity for children with newly diagnosed CC in three principal treatment centres, and T1DM in four centres between 1st January - 31st July 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019. We assessed the impact of lockdown on total diagnostic interval (TDI), patient interval (PI), system interval (SI) and disease severity.

FindingsFor CCs and T1DM, the route to diagnosis and severity of illness at presentation were unchanged across all time periods. Diagnostic intervals for CCs during lockdown were comparable to that in 2019 (TDI 4.6, PI 1.1 and SI 2.1 weeks), except for an increased PI in Jan-Mar 2020 (median 2.7 weeks). Diagnostic intervals for T1DM during lockdown were similar to that in 2019 (TDI 16 vs 15 and PI 14 vs 14 days), except for an increased PI in Jan-Mar 2020 (median 21 days).

InterpretationThere is no evidence of diagnostic delay or increased illness severity for CC or T1DM, during the first phase of the pandemic across the participating centres. This provides reassuring data for children and families with these life-changing conditions.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThis project was initiated after the first national lockdown in March 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. At the design stage, Medline was searched (with no language limit), using the keywords ((Cancer) OR (neoplasm) OR (Type 1 diabetes mellitus)) AND ((Covid-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2) OR (Pandemics)) AND ((Emergency department attendances) OR (diabetes ketoacidosis) OR (Delayed diagnosis) OR (interval) OR (wait)) to identify publications reporting the impact of the pandemic and public health measures on both overall and paediatric healthcare services. Significant changes in service utilisation in the UK were reported following the commencement of the first lockdown, including a 49% reduction in emergency department attendances in the week following the lockdown; and two adult studies reported that referral via the urgent two-week wait cancer referral diagnoses decreased by 84% from Mar-May and 60% in June 2020. As for Type 1 diabetes (T1DM), a 30 patient UK-study reported an increase in newly diagnosed T1DM during the first six weeks of lockdown. Increased proportions of severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at presentation were also reported in an Italian survey involving 53 paediatric diabetes centres. Through the search we identified a need for multi-centre, more thorough assessment on referral pathways, time taken from symptom onset to diagnosis, and its association with severity at presentation for children diagnosed with life-changing conditions during the national lockdown.

Added value of this studyOur findings suggest that the first national lockdown in the UK were not associated with delayed diagnosis of childhood cancer or type 1 diabetes at participating centres. This provides reassuring information for children and families with these life-changing conditions.

ImplicationWe believe that our study can play a key role in allaying parental and professional concern. it is important to establish whether subsequent public health measures have impacted the diagnostic interval in the context of an evolving backlog of patient referrals across the UK.",- COVID-19 Pandemic UK-based Interest Group of Childhood Cancer and Diabetes; Gemma Williams; Ross McLean; Jo-Fen Liu; Timothy Ritzmann; Madhumita Dandapani; Dhurgshaarna Shanmugavadivel; Pooja Sachdev; Mark Brougham; Rod Mitchell; Nicholas T Conway; James Law; Alice Cunnington; Gbemi Ogunnaike; Karen Brougham; Elizabeth Bayman; David A Walker,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251149,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251149,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
179,SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays in serial samples reveal earlier seroconversion in acutely ill COVID-19 patients developing ARDS,"ObjectivesDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has been suggested for (1) screening populations for disease prevalence, (2) diagnostics, and (3) guiding therapeutic applications. Here, we conducted a detailed clinical evaluation of four Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in samples from acutely ill COVID-19 patients and in two negative cohorts.

Methods443 serum specimens from serial sampling of 29 COVID-19 patients were used to determine clinical sensitivities. Patients were stratified for the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individual serum specimens from a pre-COVID-19 cohort of 238 healthy subjects and from a PCR-negative clinical cohort of 257 patients were used to determine clinical specificities. All samples were measured side-by-side with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG), Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).

ResultsMedian seroconversion occurred earlier in ARDS patients (8-9 days) than in non-ARDS patients (11-17 days), except for EUR N-IgG. Rates of positivity and mean signal ratios in the ARDS group were significantly higher than in the non-ARDS group. Sensitivities between the four tested immunoassays were equivalent. In the set of negative samples, the specificity of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) was lower (93.9 %) compared to all other assays ([&ge;]98.8 %) and the specificity of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) was lower (98.8 %) than that of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100 %).

We provide an early assessment of population-level effects from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) on 7-day incidence rates in 401 German cities and regions. Estimates reveal that the 204 cities and regions with at least one confirmed VOC case by February 4, 2021 have, on average, a 15% higher 7-day incidence rate after VOC emergence compared to cities and regions without confirmed cases.

181,"Changes in health behaviors, mental and physical health among older adults under severe lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain","BackgroundWe aimed to examine main changes in health behaviors, mental and physical health among older adults under severe lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19.

MethodsWe used prospective data from 3041 participants in four cohorts of community-dwelling individuals aged [&ge;]65 years in Spain. Data were obtained using validated questionnaires through a pre-pandemic face-to-face interview and a telephone interview conducted between weeks 7 to 15 after the beginning the COVID-19 lockdown. Lineal or multinomial, as appropriate, regression models with adjustment for the main confounders were used to assess changes in the outcome variables from the pre-pandemic to the confinement period, and to identify their associated factors.

ResultsOn average, the confinement was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diet or weight), except for a decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time, which reversed with the end of confinement. However, chronic pain worsened, and moderate declines in mental health, that did not seem to reverse after restrictions were lifted, were observed. Several subgroups of individuals were at increased risk of developing unhealthier lifestyles or mental health decline with confinement: (i)-males (for physical activity and sedentariness), (ii)-those with greater social isolation (for diet, physical activity, mental health), (iii)-feelings of loneliness (for diet, sleep quality, mental health), (iv)-poor housing conditions (for diet, physical activity, TV viewing time), (v)-unhealthy sleep duration (for physical activity and sedentariness), and (vi-worse overall health or chronic morbidities (for physical activity, screen time, mental health). On the other hand, previously having a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and doing more physical activity protected older adults from developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement.

ConclusionsThe lockdown during the first wave of the COVID-19 in Spain, which was one of the most restrictive in Europe, only led to minor average changes in health behaviors among older adults. However, mental health was moderately affected. If another lockdown were imposed on this or future pandemics, public health programs should specially address the needs of older individuals with male sex, greater social isolation, poor housing conditions and chronic morbidities, because of their greater vulnerability to the enacted movement restrictions",Esther Garcia-Esquinas; Rosario Ortol; Iago Gine-Vazquez; Jose A Carnicero; Asier Manas; Elvira Lara; Alejandro Alvarez-Bustos; German Vicente-Rodriguez; Mercedes Sotos-Prieto; Beatriz Olaya; Francisco Jose Garcia-Garcia; Narcis Gusi; Jose R Banegas; Irene Rodriguez-Gomez; Ellen A Struijk; David Martinez-Gomez; Alberto Lana; Josep Maria Haro; Jose L Ayuso-Mateos; Leocadio Rodriguez-Manas; Ignacio Ara; Marta Miret; Fernando Rodriguez-Artalejo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251738,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251738,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True

Our architecture outperforms various feature encodings-based machine learning and state-of-the-art prediction methods. As our main contribution, we introduce two types of transfer learning methods (i.e.,  frozen type and  fine-tuning type) that reliably predict interactions in a target human-virus domain based on training in a source human-virus domain, by retraining CNN layers. Our transfer learning strategies can effectively apply prior knowledge transfer from large source dataset/task to small target dataset/task to improve prediction performance. Finally, we utilize the  frozen type of transfer learning to predict human-SARS-CoV-2 PPIs, indicating that our predictions are topologically and functionally similar to experimentally known interactions.

183,A glycan gate controls opening of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is controlled by the opening of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which transitions from a glycan-shielded (down) to an exposed (up) state in order to bind the human ACE2 receptor and infect cells. While snapshots of the up and down states have been obtained by cryoEM and cryoET, details of the RBD opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here, over 200 s of weighted ensemble (WE) simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD opening pathways. Together with biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408, and D427 also participate.

184,A chicken IgY can efficiently inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the ACE2 binding domain in vitro,"COVID-19 pneumonia is spreading widely in the world now. Currently, no specific antiviral drugs have been developed. The vaccine is the most effective way to control the epidemic. Passive immune antibodies are also an effective method to prevent and cure COVID-19 pneumonia. We used SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD as an antigen to immunize layers in order to extract, separate and purify SARS-CoV-2-IgY from egg yolk. SARS-CoV-2-IgY(S-IgY) can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the Cells and reduce the viral load in cells. The EC50 of W3-IgY (S-IgY in the third week after immunization) is1.35 {+/-} 0.15nM. The EC50 of W9-IgY (S-IgYin the ninth week after immunization) is 2.76 {+/-} 1.54 nM. When the dose of S-IgY is 55 nM, the fluorescence representing intracellular viral protein is obviously weakenedin Immunofluorescence microscopy.

Results of Sars-CoV-2 /VeroE6 cell experiment confirmed that S-IgY had strong antiviral effecton SARS-Co-V-2, and its EC50 is 27.78 {+/-} 1.54nM vs 3259 {+/-} 159.62 nM of Redesivir (differ>106 times, P<0.001).

S-IgY can inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, which is related to its targeting the ACE2 binding domain.

S-IgY is safe, efficient, stable and easy to obtain. This antibody may have the potential to be an effective method for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.

185,Characterization of humoral and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in people living with HIV,"There is an urgent need to understand the nature of immune responses generated against SARS-CoV-2, to better inform risk-mitigation strategies for people living with HIV (PLWH). Although not all PLWH are considered immunosuppressed, residual cellular immune deficiency and ongoing inflammation could influence COVID-19 disease severity, the evolution and durability of protective memory responses. Here, we performed an integrated analysis, characterizing the nature, breadth and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in PLWH, controlled on ART, and HIV negative subjects. Both groups were in the convalescent phase of predominately mild COVID-19 disease. The majority of PLWH mounted SARS-CoV-2 Spike- and Nucleoprotein-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, as measured by ELISpot, at levels comparable to HIV negative subjects. T cell responses against Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid were the most prominent, with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells outnumbering CD8 T cells. Notably, the overall magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses related to the size of the naive CD4 T cell pool and the CD4:CD8 ratio in PLWH, in whom disparate antibody and T cell responses were observed. Both humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 were detected at 5-7 months post-infection, providing evidence of medium-term durability of responses irrespective of HIV serostatus. Incomplete immune reconstitution on ART and a low CD4:CD8 ratio could, however, hamper the development of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and serve as a useful tool for risk stratification of PLWH. These findings have implications for the individual management and potential effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PLWH.

186,Favourable antibody responses to human coronaviruses in children and adolescents with autoimmune rheumatic diseases,"Differences in humoral immunity to coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), between children and adults remain unexplained and the impact of underlying immune dysfunction or suppression unknown. Here, we examined the antibody immune competence of children and adolescents with prevalent inflammatory rheumatic diseases, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) and juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE), against the seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 that frequently infects this age group. Despite immune dysfunction and immunosuppressive treatment, JIA, JDM and JSLE patients mounted comparable or stronger responses than healthier peers, dominated by IgG antibodies to HCoV-OC43 spike, and harboured IgG antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike. In contrast, responses to HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins exhibited delayed age-dependent class-switching and were not elevated in JIA, JDM and JSLE patients, arguing against increased exposure. Consequently, autoimmune rheumatic diseases and their treatment were associated with a favourable ratio of spike to nucleoprotein antibodies.",Claire Deakin; Georgina Cornish; Kevin Ng; Nikhil Faulkner; William Bolland; Veera Panova; Joshua Hope; Annachiara Rosa; Ruth Harvey; Saira Hussain; Chris Earl; Bethany Jebson; Merry Wilkinson; Lucy Marshall; Lizzy Rosser; Ania Radziszewska; Hannah Peckham; Judith Heaney; Hannah Rickman; Stavroula Paraskevopoulou; Catherine Houlihan; Moria Spyer; Steve Gamblin; John Mccauley; Eleni Nastouli; Peter Cherepanov; Coziana Ciurtin; Lucy Wedderburn; George Kassiotis,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431291,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.431291,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,False
187,Live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate: Protective immunity without serious lung lesions in Syrian hamsters,"Various COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently under clinical trial. However, no live attenuated vaccine has been developed yet, despite their generally high efficacy. Here, we established temperature-sensitive mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2, whose growth was significantly slower than that of the parent strain at 37{degrees}C. One of the strains, A50-18, which presented mutations in nonstructural protein 14, did not replicate at all at 37{degrees}C in vitro. In vivo experiments demonstrated that this strain replicated inefficiently in the lungs of Syrian hamsters, and intra-nasal inoculation induced sufficient anti-SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies to protect against wild type virus infection. These results suggest that the A50-18 strain could be a promising live attenuated vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.

The high mortality rate was observed in patients who had pre-existing health conditions like cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung cancer patients was not discovered yet at the pathway level. This study was about determining the common key genes of COVID-19 and lung cancer through network analysis.

190,"Single-Domain SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD Antibodies Isolated from Immunized Llama Effectively Bind Targets of the Wuhan, UK, and South African Strains in vitro","The spreading of SARS-CoV-2 variants has become a major challenge of the current fight against the pandemic. Of particular concerns are the strains that have arisen from the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa. The UK variant spreads rapidly and is projected to overtake the original strain in the US as early as in March 2021, while the South African variant appears to evade some effects of the current vaccines. Potential false-negative diagnosis using currently available antigen kits that may not recognize these variants could cause another wave of community infection. Therefore, it is imperative that antibodies used in the detection kits are validated for binding against these variants. Here we report that the nanoantibodies (nAbs in our terminology, also referred to as VHH fragments, single domain antibodies, nanobodies) that we have developed for rapid antigen detection test bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein from the original COVID-SARS-2 virus as well as those from the UK and South African variants.

191,The Host Interactome of Spike Expands the Tropism of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) and has rapidly created a global pandemic. Patients that survive may face a slow recovery with long lasting side effects that can afflict different organs. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects epithelial airway cells that express the host entry receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) which binds to spike protein trimers on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions. However, SARS-CoV-2 can spread to other tissues even though they are negative for ACE2. To gain insight into the molecular constituents that might influence SARS-CoV-2 tropism, we determined which additional host factors engage with the viral spike protein in disease-relevant human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBEo-). We found that spike recruited the extracellular proteins laminin and thrombospondin and was retained in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) by the proteins DJB11 and FBX2 which support re-folding or degradation of nascent proteins in the ER. Because emerging mutations of the spike protein potentially impact the virus tropism, we compared the interactome of D614 spike with that of the rapidly spreading G614 mutated spike. More D614 than G614 spike associated with the proteins UGGT1, calnexin, HSP7A and GRP78/BiP which ensure glycosylation and folding of proteins in the ER. In contrast to G614 spike, D614 spike was endoproteolytically cleaved, and the N-terminal S1 domain was degraded in the ER even though C-terminal  S2 only proteoforms remained present. D614 spike also bound more laminin than G614 spike, which suggested that extracellular laminins may function as co-factor for an alternative,  S2 only dependent virus entry. Because the host interactome determines whether an infection is productive, we developed a novel proteome-based cell type set enrichment analysis (pCtSEA). With pCtSEA we determined that the host interactome of the spike protein may extend the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 beyond mucous epithelia to several different cell types, including macrophages and epithelial cells in the nephron. An  S2 only dependent, alternative infection of additional cell types with SARS-CoV-2 may impact vaccination strategies and may provide a molecular explanation for a severe or prolonged progression of disease in select COVID-19 patients.",Tom Casimir Bamberger; Sandra Pankow; Salvador Martinez-Bartolome; Jolene Diedrich; Robin Park; John Robert Yates III,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431318,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.431318,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,False
192,N-Terminal finger stabilizes the reversible feline drug GC376 in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro,"The main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CL protease) of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority drug target in the development of antivirals to combat COVID-19 infections. A feline coronavirus antiviral drug, GC376, has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and live virus growth. As this drug moves into clinical trials, further characterization of GC376 with the main protease of coronaviruses is required to gain insight into the drugs properties, such as reversibility and broad specificity. Reversibility is an important factor for therapeutic proteolytic inhibitors to prevent toxicity due to off-target effects. Here we demonstrate that GC376 has nanomolar Ki values with the Mpro from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV strains. Restoring enzymatic activity after inhibition by GC376 demonstrates reversible binding with both proteases. In addition, the stability and thermodynamic parameters of both proteases were studied to shed light on physical chemical properties of these viral enzymes, revealing higher stability for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The comparison of a new X-ray crystal structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV complexed with GC376 reveals similar molecular mechanism of inhibition compared to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and gives insight into the broad specificity properties of this drug. In both structures, we observe domain swapping of the N-termini in the dimer of the Mpro, which facilitates coordination of the drugs P1 position. These results validate that GC376 is a drug with an off-rate suitable for clinical trials.",Elena Arutyunova; Muhammad Bashir Khan; Conrad Fischer; Jimmy Lu; Tess Lamer; Wayne Vuong; Marco J van Belkum; Ryan T McKay; D.

193,Endothelial cells elicit a pro-inflammatory response to SARS-COV-2 without productive viral infection,"Thrombotic and microvascular complications are frequently seen in deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting that vascular pathology is a major driver of severe disease. However, whether this is caused by direct viral infection of the endothelium or inflammation-induced endothelial activation remains highly contentious. What role the endothelium plays in viral amplification and inflammation thus remains a key unresolved question in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we use patient autopsy samples, primary human endothelial cells and an in vitro model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial cell barrier to show that primary human endothelial cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2, albeit at low levels. Accordingly, when present in a sufficiently high concentration, SARS-CoV-2 can enter primary human endothelial cells from either the apical or basolateral surface. Whilst inducing an inflammatory response, this is not a productive infection. We further demonstrate that in a co-culture model of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier, endothelial cells are not infected with SARS-CoV-2. They do however, sense and respond to an infection in the adjacent epithelial cells, resulting in the induction of a pro-inflammatory response.

Taken together, these data suggest that in vivo, endothelial cells are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that infection is only likely to occur if the adjacent pulmonary epithelium is denuded (basolateral infection) or a high viral load is present in the blood (apical infection). In such a scenario, whilst SARS-CoV-2 infection of the endothelium can occur, it does not contribute to viral amplification. However, endothelial cells are still likely to play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by sensing and mounting a pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2.",Lilian Schimmel; Keng Yih Chew; Claudia Stocks; Teodor Yordanov; Tish Essebier; Arutha Kulasinghe; James Monkman; Anna Flavia Ribeiro dos Santos Miggiolaro; Lucia De Noronha; Anne K Lagendijk; Kate Schroder; Larisa Labzin; Emma J Gordon; Kirsty R Short,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431177,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431177,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,False
194,"The impact of armed conflict on the epidemiological situation of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Libya, Syria, and Yemen.","BackgroundSince the Arab uprising 2011, Libya, Syria, and Yemen have gone through a major armed conflict. This resulted in a high rate of mortality, injury, and population displacement with a collapse of the health care system. Furthermore, it was complicated by the emergence of, COVID-19 as a global pandemic which made the population of these countries strive under unusual conditions to tackle both the pandemic and the ongoing wars. The objectives of this study were to determine the impacts and influence of armed conflicts on the epidemiology of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) within these war-torn countries and outline the needed strategies to combat the spread of the pandemic and its upcoming consequences.

MethodsThe official and public data regarding the dynamics of armed conflict and the spread, of SARS-COV-19 in Libya, Syria, and Yemen were collected from all available sources. Starting from the early emergence of the COVID-19 in each country until the end of December 2020. Datasets were analyzed through a set of statistical techniques and the weekly resolved data were used to probe the link between the intensity levels of the armed conflict and the spread of the pandemic.

ResultsData indicated that there is an increase in the intensity of violence levels at an early stage from March to August reached up to two folds in the three countries particularly in Libya. In this violent period, few cases of COVID-19 were reported ranging from 5-53 cases/day. From September to December, a significant decline in the level of the armed conflict was accompanied by steep upsurges in the number of reported COVID-19 cases reached up to 500 cases/day. The highest accumulative cases of COVID-19 were reported in Libya, Syria, and Yemen respectively.

ConclusionsOur analysis demonstrates that the armed conflict has provided an opportunity for SARS-COV-19 to spread. At the early weeks of the pandemic that coincided with high levels of the armed conflict few cases were officially reported indicating a vast undercount, which may suggest a hidden mitigating spread at an early stage. Then the pandemic increased immensely as the armed conflict decline to reach the highest by December. A full-blown transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic in these countries is expected. Therefore, urgent national and international strategies should be implemented to combat the pandemic and its upcoming consequences.",Mohamed A Daw Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251654,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251654,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
195,"Mortality from injury, overdose and suicide during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, March-July, 2020","Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with substantial rates of all-cause excess mortality. The contribution of external causes of death to excess mortality including drug overdose, homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries during the initial outbreak in the United States is less well documented.

MethodsUsing public data published by the National Center for Health Statistics on February 10, 2021, we measured monthly excess mortality (the gap between observed and expected deaths) from five external causes using national-level data published by National Center for Health Statistics; assault (homicide); intentional self-harm (suicide); accidents (unintentional injuries); and motor vehicle accidents. We used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sARIMA) models developed with cause-specific monthly mortality counts and US population data from 2015-2019 and estimated the contribution of individual cause-specific mortality to all-cause excess mortality from March-July 2020.

ResultsFrom March-July, 2020, 212,825 (95% CI 136,236-290,776) all-cause excess deaths occurred in the US). There were 8,540 excess drug overdoses (all intents) (95% CI 5,106 to 11,975), accounting for 4% of all excess mortality; 1,455 excess homicide deaths (95% CI 708 to 2202, accounting for 0.7% of excess mortality; 5,492 excess deaths due to unintentional accidents occurred (95% CI 85 to 10,899, accounting for 2.6% of excess mortality. Though a non-significantly 135 (95% CI -1361 to 1,630) more MVA deaths were recorded during the study period, a significant decrease in April (525; 95% CI -817 to -233) and significant increases in June-July (965; 95% CI 348 to 1,587) were observed. Suicide deaths were statistically lower than projected by 2,067 (95% CI 941-3,193 fewer deaths).

MeaningExcess deaths from drug overdoses, homicide, and addicents occurred during the pandemic but represented a small fraction of all-cause excess mortality. The excess external causes of death, however, still represent thousands of lives lost. Notably, deaths from suicide were lower than expected and therefore did not contribute to excess mortality.",Jeremy Faust; Chengan Du; Katherine Mayes; Shu-Xia Li; Zhenqiu Lin; Michael L Barnett; Harlan M Krumholz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251682,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251682,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
196,Severe COVID-19 pneumonia and barotrauma: From the frying pan into the fire.,"AimCOVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS (C-ARDS) has a high mortality. Preliminary reports indicate a higher incidence of barotrauma in patients with C-ARDS[1] both on invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) This study examines the incidence and risk factors for barotrauma and change in outcomes after barotrauma in patients with severe C-ARDS on positive pressure respiratory support (PPRS).

Methods and materialsThis is a retrospective study of C-ARDS associated barotrauma over 5 months in patients on PPRS in a tertiary COVID care center. The type of barotrauma, intervention, related factors, such as type of respiratory support (iMV vs NIV), airway pressure prior to the occurrence of barotrauma, and post-barotrauma outcomes were analyzed.

ResultsA total of 38/410 (9.3%) C-ARDS patients on PPRS [mean age 57.82 {+/-} 13.3 years, 32 males (84.2%)] developed barotrauma. Of these, 20 patients (52.6%) were on NIV and 18 (47.4%) patients were iMV on standard recommended settings. The median P/F ratio of patients on MV at the time of barotrauma was 116.4 (IQR 72.4, 193.25). The details of barotrauma were as follows: 24 patients had pneumothorax (PTX), 2 had pneumo-mediastinum and 12 had subcutaneous emphysema. Overall, 24/38 (63.2%) patients, including 15/18 (83.3%) on MV succumbed to their illness. The barotrauma happened a median of 6.5 days (IQR 4.75,13) after admission and 15 days (IQR 10.25,18.0) from symptom onset. The median duration from barotrauma to death was 7 days (IQR 2.25, 8.0) and barotrauma to discharge (for survivors) was 12.5 days (IQR 8.0, 21.25). All patients received steroids and 11/38 (28.9%) received additional immunosuppression with tocilizumab.

ConclusionA high incidence of barotrauma was seen in this large series of severe C-ARDS patients on PPRS. Barotrauma led to further deterioration in the clinical status leading to a fatal outcome in the majority of the MV patients, despite prompt treatment.",Hariprasad Kalpakam; Sameer Bansal; Nithya .

197,An analysis of school absences in England during the Covid-19 pandemic,"The introduction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection, in the UK in early 2020, resulted in the UK government introducing several control policies in order to reduce the spread of disease. As part of these restrictions, schools were closed to all pupils in March (except for vulnerable and key worker children), before re-opening to certain year groups in June. Finally all school children returned to the classroom in September. In this paper, we analyse the data on school absences from September 2020 to December 2020 as a result of COVID-19 infection and how that varied through time as other measures in the community were introduced. We utilise data from the Educational Settings database compiled by the Department for Education and examine how pupil and teacher absences change in both primary and secondary schools.

Our results show that absences as a result of COVID-19 infection rose steadily following the re-opening of schools in September. Cases in teachers were seen to decline during the November lockdown, particularly in those regions that had previously been in tier 3, the highest level of control at the time. Cases in secondary school pupils increased for the first two weeks of the November lockdown, before decreasing. Since the introduction of the tier system, the number of absences owing to confirmed infection in primary schools was observed to be significantly lower than in secondary schools across all regions and tiers.

In December, we observed a large rise in the number of absences per school in secondary school settings in the South East and Greater London, but such rises were not observed in other regions or in primary school settings. We conjecture that the increased transmissibility of the new variant in these regions may have contributed to this rise in cases in secondary schools. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between cases in the community and cases in schools in most regions, with weak evidence suggesting that cases in schools lag behind cases in the surrounding community. We conclude that there is not significant evidence to suggest that schools are playing a significant role in driving spread in the community and that careful monitoring may be required as schools re-open to determine the effect associated with open schools upon community incidence.",Emma R Southall; Alex Holmes; Edward M Hill; Benjamin D Atkins; Trystan Leng; Robin N Thompson; Louise J Dyson; Matt J Keeling; Michael Tildesley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251484,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251484,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
198,Anterior nasal versus nasal mid-turbinate sampling for a SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test: does localisation or professional collection matter?,"ObjectivesThe aim of this diagnostic accuracy study was direct comparison of two different nasal sampling methods for an antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) that detects severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the accuracy and feasibility of self-sampling was evaluated.

MethodsThis manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study, compared professional anterior nasal (AN) and nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) sampling for a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. A second group of participants collected a NMT sample themselves and underwent a professional nasopharyngeal swab for comparison. The reference standard was real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sampling. Individuals with high suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested. Sensitivity, specificity, and percent agreement were calculated. Self-sampling was observed without intervention. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires.

ResultsAmong 132 symptomatic adults, both professional AN- and NMT-sampling yielded a sensitivity of 86.1% (31/36 RT-PCR positives detected; 95%CI: 71.3-93.9) and a specificity of 100.0% (95%CI: 95.7-100). The positive percent agreement (PPA) was 100% (95%CI: 89.0-100). Among 96 additional adults, self NMT- and professional NP-sampling yielded an identical sensitivity of 91.2% (31/34; 95%CI 77.0-97.0). Specificity was 98.4% (95%CI: 91.4-99.9) with NMT- and 100.0% (95%CI: 94.2-100) with NP-sampling. The PPA was 96.8% (95%CI: 83.8-99.8). Most participants (85.3%) considered self-sampling as easy to perform.

ConclusionProfessional AN- and NMT-sampling are of equivalent accuracy for an Ag-RDT in ambulatory symptomatic adults. Participants were able to reliably perform the NMT-sampling themselves, following written and illustrated instructions.

We want to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 exposure could trigger a humoral response against apolipoprotein A-1 (anti-apoA-1 IgG) through molecular mimicry and assess its relationship to patient prognosis.

Methods and ResultsAnti-Spike domain 1 (SD1) IgGs, anti-apoA-1 IgGs and against mimic peptides, as well as cytokines were assessed by immunoassays on a case-control (n=101), an intensive care unit (ICU; n=126) with a 28-days follow-up, and a general population cohort (n=663) with available samples in the pre and post-pandemic period. Linear sequence homologies and antibodies cross-reactivity between apoA-1, TLR2, and Spike epitopes were identified. Overall, anti-apoA-1 IgG levels were higher in COVID-19 patients or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals than in healthy donors or anti-SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals (p<0.0001). Significant and similar associations were noted between anti-apoA-1, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, cytokines, and lipid profile. In ICU patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-apoA-1 seroconversion rates displayed similar 7-days kinetics, reaching 82% for anti-apoA-1 seropositivity. C-statistics (CS) indicated that anti-Spike/TLR2 mimic-peptide IgGs displayed a significant prognostic accuracy for overall mortality at 28 days (CS: 0.64; p=0.02). In the general population, SARS-CoV-2 exposure increased baseline anti-apoA-1 IgG levels.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 induces a marked humoral response against the major protein of high-density lipoproteins. As a correlate of poorer prognosis in other clinical settings, such autoimmunity signatures may relate to long-term COVID-19 prognosis assessment and warrant further scrutiny in the current COVID-19 pandemic.",Sabrina Pagano; Sabine Yerly; Benjamin Meyer; Catherine Juillard; Noemie Suh; Christophe LeTerrier; Jean-Pierre Daguer; Lluc Farrera Soler; Sofia Barluenga; Giovanni Piumatti; Oliver Hartley; Barbara Lemaitre; Christiane Sigrid Eberhardt; Claire-Anne Siegrist; Isabella Eckerle; Silvia Stringhini; Idris Guessous; Laurent Kaiser; Jerome Pugin; Nicolas Winssinger; Nicolas Vuilleumier,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251298,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251298,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True

201,Treatment of irritant contact dermatitis in healthcare settings during the COVID19 pandemic: The emollient Dermol 500 exhibits virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2.,"ObjectivesTo investigate whether the antimicrobial emollient Dermol 500 and its active components, benzalkonium chloride (BAK) and chlorohexidine dihydrochloride (CD), exhibit virucidal activity thus informing whether Dermol 500 is a suitable soap substitute for use during the COVID19 pandemic, to combat the increased incidence of work-related contact dermatitis in clinical settings that we report here.

MethodsInactivation of influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 by Dermol 500 and the independent and combined virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD was assessed by influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assays. Viruses were treated with concentrations of BAK and CD comparable to Dermol 500, and lower, and infectivity of the viruses assessed by titration.

ResultsDermol 500 exhibits comparable virucidal activity to alcohol-based sanitisers against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD exhibit independent and synergistic virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID19.

ConclusionsThe synergistic virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD makes Dermol 500 suitable as a soap substitute to treat and prevent work-related contact dermatitis in healthcare settings.

202,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva samples in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases,"SARS-CoV-2 infections can be symptomatic as well as asymptomatic. In this study, we analyzed 460,814 saliva samples collected from July 2020 to January 2021 for a SARS-CoV-2-specific gene target using the FDA EUA test, CRL Rapid Response, based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We measured SARS-CoV-2 viral loads using cycle threshold (Ct) values. A total of 17,813 samples tested positive for COVID-19 using self-collected saliva samples. The Ct values ranged from 11 to 40, 91.3% distributed between 22 to 38 Ct. We then compared Ct values for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases for all positive saliva samples. A total of 8,706 cases were symptomatic with an average Ct value of 29.24, and 9,107 cases were asymptomatic with an average Ct value of 30.99. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (Ct) in saliva samples for both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are similar.",Anuja Bhatta; Rebecca Henkhaus; Heather L Fehling,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251229,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.21251229,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True
203,A surrogate virus neutralization test to quantify antibody-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in finger stick dried blood spot samples,"BackgroundThe spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter host cells, and neutralizing antibodies are effective at blocking this interaction to prevent infection. Widespread application of this important marker of protective immunity is limited by logistical and technical challenges associated with live virus methods and venous blood collection. To address this gap, we validated an immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction in a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected on filter paper as a dried blood spot (DBS) sample.

MethodsSamples are eluted overnight and incubated in the presence of spike antigen and ACE2 in a 96-well solid phase plate. Competitive immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent label is used to quantify neutralizing activity. The following measures of assay performance were evaluated: dilution series of confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with results from matched DBS-serum samples, analysis of results from DBS samples with known COVID-19 status, and precision (intra-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV) and reliability (inter-assay; %CV).

ResultsDilution series produced the expected pattern of dose-response. Agreement between results from serum and DBS samples was high, with concordance correlation = 0.991. Analysis of three control samples across the measurement range indicated acceptable levels of precision and reliability. Median % neutralization was 46.9 for PCR confirmed convalescent COVID-19 samples and 0.1 for negative samples.

ConclusionsLarge-scale testing is important for quantifying neutralizing antibodies that can provide protection against COVID-19 in order to estimate the level of immunity in the general population. DBS provides a minimally-invasive, low cost alternative to venous blood collection, and this scalable immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction can be used as a surrogate for virus-based assays to expand testing across a wide range of settings and populations.",Amelia Sancilio; Richard D'Aquila; ELIZABETH MCNALLY; Matt Velez; Michael Ison; Alexis R.

204,Ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection using exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose in a public health setting,"BackgroundRapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is crucial for taking timely measures and minimizing the risk of further SARS-CoV-2 spread. We aimed to assess the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) for the discrimination between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis was a prospective real-world study of individuals presenting to public test facility for SARS-CoV-2 detection by molecular amplification tests (TMA or RT-PCR). After sampling of a combined throat/nasopharyngeal swab, breath profiles were obtained using a cloud-connected eNose. Data-analysis involved advanced signal processing and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and ROC analysis. Data from the training set were tested in a validation, a replication and an asymptomatic set.

FindingsFor the analysis 4510 individuals were available. In the training set (35 individuals with; 869 without SARS-CoV-2), the eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.947 (CI:0.928-0.967). These results were confirmed in the validation set (0.957; CI:0.942-0.971, n=904) and externally validated in the replication set (0.937; CI:0.926-0.947, n=1948) and the asymptomatic set (0.909; CI:0.879-0.938, n=754). Selecting a cut-off value of 0.30 in the training set resulted in a sensitivity/specificity of 100/78, >99/84, 98/82% in the validation, replication and asymptomatic set, respectively.

InterpretationeNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities and can be used as a screening test to define who needs an additional confirmation test.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSElectronic nose technology is an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis and phenotyping of a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and infections.

As of Feb 13, 2021, our search of PubMed using keywords ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""eNose"" OR ""electronic nose"" OR ""exhaled breath analysis"" yielded 4 articles (1-4) that have assessed test characteristics of electronic nose to diagnose COVID-19. In these small studies the obtained signals using sensor-based technologies, two-dimensional gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry, provided adequate discrimination between patients with and without COVID-19.

Added value of this studyWe prospectively studied the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) to diagnose or rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with and without symptoms presenting to a public test facility. In the training set with 904 individuals, the eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.948. In three independent validation cohorts of 3606 individuals in total, eNose was able to reliably rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection in 70-75% of individuals, with a sensitivity ranging between 98-100%, and a specificity between 78-84%. No association was found between cycle thresholds values, as semi-quantitative measure of viral load, and eNose variables.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe available findings, including those from our study, support the use of eNose technology to distinguish between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection with high accuracy. Exhaled breath analysis by eNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities. The results can be made available within seconds and can therefore be used as screening instrument. The eNose can reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminating the need for additional time-consuming, stressful, and expensive diagnostic tests in the majority of individuals.",Rianne de Vries; Rene M.

205,Reinfection Rates among Patients who Previously Tested Positive for COVID-19: a Retrospective Cohort Study,"ObjectivesTo evaluate reinfection rates and protective effectiveness of prior disease among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in the United States.

DesignRetrospective cohort study

SettingOne multi-hospital health system in Ohio and Florida

ParticipantsAll 150,325 patients who were tested for COVID-19 infection via PCR from March 12, 2020 to August 30, 2020. Testing performed up to January 7, 2021 in these patients was included for analysis. Healthcare workers were excluded.

Main outcome measuresThe main outcome was reinfection, defined as infection [&ge;] 90 days after initial testing. Secondary outcomes were symptomatic infection and protective effectiveness of prior infection.

ResultsOf 150,325 patients tested for COVID-19 prior to August 30, 8,845 (5.9%) tested positive and 141,480 (94.1%) tested negative. 974 (11%) of the positive patients were retested after 90 days, and 56 had possible reinfection. Of those, 26 (46.4 %) were symptomatic. Of those with initial negative testing, 4,163 (12.9%) were subsequently positive and 2,460 of those (59.1%) were symptomatic. Protective effectiveness of prior infection was 78.5% (95% confidence interval 72.0 to 83.5), and against symptomatic infection was 83.1% (95% confidence interval 75.1 to 88.5). Protective effectiveness increased over time.

ConclusionsPrior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. Protective effectiveness increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection.

207,Biological attributes of age and gender variations in Indian COVID-19 cases: A retrospective data analysis,"BackgroundThe associated risk factors, co-morbid conditions and biological variations varying with gender and age might be the cause of higher COVID-19 infection and deaths among males and older persons. The objective of this study was to predict and specify the biological attributes of variation in age and gender-based on COVID-19 status (deceased/recovered).

MethodsIn this retrospective study, the data was extracted from a recognised web-based portal. A total of 112,860 patients record was filtered out and an additional 9,131 records were separately analyzed to examine age and gender relationship with patients COVID-19 status (recovered/deceased). Chi-square, t-test, binary logistic regression, and longitudinal regression analysis were conducted.

ResultsThe male COVID-19 cases (65.39%) were more than females (34.61%) and mean age of infected and recovered patients was 39.47{+/-}17.59 years and 36.85{+/-}18.51 years respectively. The odds for infection was significantly higher among females for lower age categories, which declines with age. The age-adjusted odds for recovery were significantly higher among females (O.R.=1.779) and odds for recovery was highest in 5-17 years age category (O.R.=88.286) independent of gender.

ConclusionThe chances of being COVID-19 infected was higher for females of lower age categories (<35 years) which decreases with age. The odds for recovery among females was significantly higher than males. The chances of recovery declines with increasing age and the variation could be attributed to the biological differences between age categories and gender.",Savitesh Kushwaha; Poonam Khanna; Vineeth Rajagopal; Tanvi Kiran,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251681,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.21251681,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,,True

209,Learning Where to Look for COVID-19 Growth: Multivariate Analysis of COVID-19 Cases Over Time using Explainable Convolution-LSTM,"Determinant factors which contribute to the prediction should take into account multivariate analysis for capturing coarse-to-fine contextual information. From the preliminary descriptive analysis, it shows that environmental factor such as UV (ultraviolet) is one of the essential factors that should be considered to observe the COVID-19 epidemic drivers, During summer, UV can inactivate viruses that live in the air and on the surface of the objects especially at noon in tropical or subtropical countries. However, it may not be significant in closed spaces like workspace and areas with the intensive human-to-human transmission, especially in densely populated areas. Different COVID-19 pandemic growth patterns in northern subtropical, southern subtropical and tropical countries occur over time. Moreover, there are education, government, morphological, health, economic, and behavioral factors contributing to the growth of COVID-19. Multivariate analysis via visual attribution of explainable Convolution-LSTM is utilized to see high contributing factors responsible for the growth of daily COVID-19 cases.

211,"HaVoC, a bioinformatic pipeline for reference-based consensus assembly and lineage assignment for SARS-CoV-2 sequences","BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 related research has increased in importance worldwide since December 2019. Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally, of which the most notable and concerning currently are the UK variant B.1.1.7, the South African variant B1.351 and the Brazilian variant P.1. Detecting and monitoring novel variants is essential in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. While there are several tools for assembling virus genomes and performing lineage analyses to investigate SARS-CoV-2, each is limited to performing singular or a few functions separately.

ResultsDue to the lack of publicly available pipelines, which could perform fast reference-based assemblies on raw SARS-CoV-2 sequences in addition to identifying lineages to detect variants of concern, we have developed an open source bioinformatic pipeline called HaVoC (Helsinki university Analyzer for Variants Of Concern). HaVoC can reference assemble raw sequence reads and assign the corresponding lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

ConclusionsHaVoC is a pipeline utilizing several bioinformatic tools to perform multiple necessary analyses for investigating genetic variance among SARS-CoV-2 samples. The pipeline is particularly useful for those who need a more accessible and fast tool to detect and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during local outbreaks.

213,Direct activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is blocked by Simvastatin,"Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved with endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-{kappa}B and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not affect endothelial activation. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.",Yisong Qian; Tianhua Lei; Parth Patel; Chi Lee; Paula Monaghan-Nichols; Hong-Bo Xin; Jianming Qiu; Mingui Fu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431174,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431174,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False

This process is distinct from alternative splicing in eukaryotes, rendering current transcript assembly methods unsuitable to Nidovirales sequencing samples. Here, we introduce the DO_SCPLOWISCONTINUOUSC_SCPLOW TO_SCPLOWRANSCRIPTC_SCPLOW AO_SCPLOWSSEMBLYC_SCPLOW problem of finding transcripts [Formula] and their abundances c given an alignment [Formula] under a maximum likelihood model that accounts for varying transcript lengths. Underpinning our approach is the concept of a segment graph, a directed acyclic graph that, distinct from the splice graph used to characterize alternative splicing, has a unique Hamiltonian path. We provide a compact characterization of solutions as subsets of non-overlapping edges in this graph, enabling the formulation of an efficient mixed integer linear program. We show using simulations that our method, JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW, drastically outperforms existing methods for classical transcript assembly. On short-read data of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 samples, we find that JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW not only identifies canonical transcripts that are part of the reference transcriptome, but also predicts expression of non-canonical transcripts that are well supported by direct evidence from long-read data, presence in multiple, independent samples or a conserved core sequence. JO_SCPLOWUMPERC_SCPLOW enables detailed analyses of Nidovirales transcriptomes.

216,SARS CoV-2 nucleoprotein enhances the infectivity of lentiviral spike particles,"The establishment of SARS CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral (LV) systems has enabled the rapid identification of entry inhibitors and neutralizing agents, alongside allowing for the study of this emerging pathogen in BSL-2 level facilities. While such frameworks recapitulate the cellular entry process in ACE2+ cells, they are largely unable to factor in supplemental contributions by other SARS CoV-2 genes. To address this, we performed an unbiased ORF screen and identified the nucleoprotein (N) as a potent enhancer of spike-pseudotyped LV particle infectivity. We further demonstrate that this augmentation by N renders LV spike particles less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody. Biochemical analysis revealed that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of SARS CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Importantly, this improvement in infectivity is achieved without a concomitant increase in sensitivity towards RBD binding-based neutralization. Our results hold important implications for the design and interpretation of similar LV pseudotyping-based studies.",Tarun Mishra; Sreepadmanabh M; Pavitra Ramdas; Amit Kumar Sahu; Atul Kumar; Ajit Chande,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.430757,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.430757,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False
217,SARS-CoV2 envelop proteins reshape the serological responses of COVID-19 patients,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has elicited a unique international mobilization of the scientific community to better understand this coronavirus and its associated disease and to develop efficient tools to combat infection. Similar to other coronavirae, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the host cell complex secretory machinery to produce properly folded viral proteins that will compose the nascent virions; including Spike, Envelope and Membrane proteins, the most exposed membrane viral proteins to the host immune system. Antibody response is part of the anti-viral immune arsenal that infected patients develop to fight viral particles in the body. Herein, we investigate the immunogenic potential of Spike (S), Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) proteins using a human cell-based system to mimic membrane insertion and N-glycosylation. We show that both S and M proteins elicit the production of specific IgG, IgM and IgA in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Elevated Ig responses were observed in COVID+ patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. Finally, when SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614 and G614 variants were compared, reduced Ig binding was observed with the Spike G614 variant. Altogether, this study underlines the needs for including topological features in envelop proteins to better characterize the serological status of COVID+ patients, points towards an unexpected immune response against the M protein and shows that our assay could represent a powerful tool to test humoral responses against actively evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine effectiveness.",Sophie Martin; Christopher Heslan; Gwenaele Jegou; Leif A.

218,Recent and forecast post-COVID trends in hospital activity in England amongst 0 to 24 year olds: analyses using routine hospital administrative data,"BackgroundIncreasing hospital use in the past decade has placed considerable strain on children and young peoples (CYP) health services in England. Greater integration of healthcare may reduce these increases. We projected CYP healthcare activity out to 2040 and examined the potential impact of integrated care systems on projected activity.

MethodsWe used routine administrative data (Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)) on emergency department (ED) attendances, emergency admissions and outpatient (OP) attendances for England by age-group for 0-24 year olds from 2007 to 2017. Bayesian projections of future activity used projected population and ethnicity and future child poverty rates. Cause data were used to identify ambulatory-care-sensitive-conditions (ACSC).

FindingsED attendances, emergency admissions and OP attendances increased in all age groups from 2007 to 2017. ED and OP attendances increased 60-80% amongst children under 10 years. ACSC and neonatal causes drove the majority of increases in emergency admissions. Activity was projected to increase by 2040 by 50-145% for ED attendances, 20-125% for OP attendances and 4-58% for total admissions. Scenarios of increasing or decreasing child poverty resulted in small changes to forecast activity. Scenarios in which 50% of ACSC were seen outside hospital in integrated care reduced estimated activity in 2040 by 21.2-25.9% for admissions and 23.5-30.1% for ED attendances across poverty scenarios amongst infants.

InterpretationThe rapid increases in CYP healthcare activity seen in the past decade may continue for the next decade given projected changes in population and child poverty, unless some of the drivers of increased activity are addressed. Contrary to these pessimistic scenarios, our findings suggest that development of integrated care for CYP at scale in England has the potential to dramatically reduce or even reverse these forecast increases

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere has been marked increases in hospital use (inpatient, outpatient and emergency department (ED)) by children and young people (CYP). Search of the PubMed database using the search terms: (((((""child""[MeSH Major Topic]) OR (""adolescent""[MeSH Major Topic])) OR (""infant""[MeSH Major Topic]))) AND ((healthcare use[Text Word])) OR (emergency admission[Text Word])) AND (united kingdom[Text Word]). Drivers of increased activity include population growth and sociodemographic factors, help-seeking behaviour, growth in medical knowledge and capability, and by factors within the health system. Additional factors in child health include increased survival of premature neonates and those with congenital conditions and rising parental expectations of modern medicine. Previous studies have shown that ambulatory-care-sensitive-conditions (ACSC) are responsible for much of the increase in CYP emergency activity in England and Scotland.

Added value of this studyThis is the first study to use existing data to project possible future scenarios for CYP healthcare activity out to 2030 and 2040 in any country. Our future scenarios are based upon authoritative projections for population, ethnic diversity and child poverty in England and allow us to estimate the potential impact of integrated care scenarios in which ACSC are treated outside hospital. We show that future projected CYP activity is very high if mitigations such as integrated care are not instituted in England.

Implications of all the available evidenceHealthcare activity has grown dramatically over the last decade in CYP, largely due to ACSC and the consequences of premature delivery. Projections to 2040 suggest that similar increases are likely over the next 2 decades without action to reduce child poverty and implementation of integrated care at scale in the NHS.",Joseph L Ward; Dougal Hargreaves; Marie Rogers; Alison Firth; Steve Turner; Russell M.

219,"Noncommunicable Diseases, Sociodemographic Vulnerability, and the Risk of Mortality in Hospitalized Children and Adolescents with COVID-19 in Brazil: A Syndemic in Play","BackgroundAlthough many studies identify the presence of comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as risk factors for worse COVID-19 outcomes, few have addressed this issue in children. We aimed to study how these factors have impacted COVID-19 mortality in Brazilian children and adolescents.

MethodsThis is an observational study using publicly available data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We studied 5,857 patients younger than 20 years old, all of them hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We used multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear models to study mortality, stratifying the analysis by age, region of the country, presence of noncommunicable diseases, ethnicity, and socioeconomic development.

FindingsIndividually, most of the comorbidities included were risk factors. Having more than one comorbidity increased almost tenfold the risk of death (OR 9{middle dot}67 95%CI 6{middle dot}89-13{middle dot}57). Compared to White children, Indigenous, Pardo (mixed), and East Asian had a significantly higher risk of mortality. We also found a regional effect (higher mortality in the North), and a socioeconomic effect (higher mortality among children from less socioeconomically developed municipalities).

InterpretationBesides the impact of comorbidities, we identified ethnic, regional, and socioeconomic effects shaping the mortality of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Brazil. Putting these findings together, we propose that there is a syndemic among COVID-19 and noncommunicable diseases, driven and fostered by large-scale sociodemographic inequalities. Facing COVID-19 in Brazil must also include addressing these structural issues. Our findings also identify risk groups among children that should be prioritized for public health measures, such as vaccination.

220,Associations between movement behaviors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile,"BackgroundThere is limited evidence about emotional and behavioral responses in toddlers and preschoolers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly in Latin America.

ObjectiveTo assess associations between changes in movement behaviors (physical activity, screen time and sleeping) and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the pandemic in Chile.

MethodsA cross-sectional study conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. Main caregivers of 1-to 5-year-old children living in Chile answered an online survey that included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, changes in the childs emotions and behaviors, movement behaviors and caregivers stress during the pandemic. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the association between different factors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers.

ResultsIn total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data on emotional changes for children aged 2.9{+/-}1.36 years old, 47.9% girls. A large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and behavioral changes. Most caregivers reported that children were  more affectionate (78.9%),  more restless (65.1%), and  more frustrated (54.1%) compared with pre-pandemic times. Apart from changes in movement behaviors, factors such as child age, caregivers age and stress, and residential area (urban/rural) were consistently associated with changes in emotions and behaviors.

ConclusionThe pandemic substantially affected the emotions and behaviors of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile.

Over 500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been detected since December 2020, but its local establishment and pathways of spread are relatively unknown. Using travel, genomic, and diagnostic testing data, we highlight the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US and locations of possible underreporting of B.1.1.7 cases. New York, which receives the most international travel from the UK, is likely one of the key hubs for introductions and domestic spread.

223,Association of demographic and occupational factors with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine uptake in a multi-ethnic UK healthcare workforce: a rapid real-world analysis,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and adverse outcome. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is now available for frontline UK HCWs; however, demographic/occupational associations with vaccine uptake in this cohort are unknown. We sought to establish these associations in a large UK hospital workforce.

MethodsWe conducted cross-sectional surveillance examining vaccine uptake amongst all staff at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. We examined proportions of vaccinated staff stratified by demographic factors, occupation and previous COVID-19 test results (serology/PCR) and used logistic regression to identify predictors of vaccination status after adjustment for confounders.

FindingsWe included 19,044 HCWs; 12,278 (64.5%) had received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Compared to White HCWs (70.9% vaccinated), a significantly smaller proportion of ethnic minority HCWs were vaccinated (South Asian 58.5%, Black 36.8% p<0.001 for both). After adjustment, factors found to be negatively associated with vaccine uptake were; younger age, female sex, increasing deprivation and belonging to any non-White ethnic group (Black: aOR0.30, 95%CI 0.26-0.34, South Asian:0.67, 0.62-0.72). Those that had previously had confirmed COVID-19 (by PCR) were less likely to be vaccinated than those who had tested negative.

InterpretationEthnic minority HCWs and those from more deprived areas as well as younger, female staff are less likely to take up SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. These findings have major implications for the delivery of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programmes in HCWs and the wider population and should inform the national vaccination programme to prevent the disparities of the pandemic from widening.

224,"Population Age-Ineligible for COVID-19 Vaccine in the United States: Implications for State, County, and Race/Ethnicity Vaccination Targets","BackgroundWe examined the geographic and racial/ethnic distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine age-ineligible population (0-15 years old) in the U.S., and calculated the proportion of the age-eligible population that will need to be vaccinated in a given geo-demographic group in order to achieve either 60% or 75% vaccine coverage for that population as a whole.

MethodsUS Census Bureau population estimates for 2019 were used to calculate the percent vaccine ineligible and related measures for counties, states, and the nation as a whole. Vaccination targets for the 30 largest counties by population were calculated. Study measures were calculated for racial/ethnic populations at the national (n=7) and state (n=6) levels.

ResultsPercent of population ineligible for vaccine varied widely both geographically and by race/ethnicity. State values ranged from 15.8% in Vermont to 25.7% in Utah, while percent ineligible of the major racial/ethnic groups was 16.4% of non-Hispanic whites, 21.6% of non-Hispanic Blacks, and 27.5% of Hispanics. Achievement of total population vaccine coverage of at least 75% will require vaccinating more than 90% of the population aged 16 years and older in 29 out of 30 of the largest counties in the U.S.

ConclusionsThe vaccine-ineligibility of most children for the next 1-2 years, coupled with reported pervasive vaccine hesitancy among adults, especially women and most minorities, means that achievement of adequate levels of vaccine coverage will be very difficult for many vulnerable geographic areas and for several racial/ethnic minority groups, particularly Hispanics, Blacks, and American Indians.",Elizabeth B Pathak; Janelle Menard; Rebecca B Garcia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251562,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251562,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
225,Impacts of school closures on physical and mental health of children and young people: a systematic review,"BackgroundThe well-documented links between education and health mean that school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to be associated with significant health harms to children and young people (CYP). A systematic review of the evidence is needed to inform policy decisions around school closures and re-openings during the pandemic.

MethodsWe undertook a high-quality systematic review of observational quantitative studies (published or preprint) of the impacts of school closures (for any reason) on the health, wellbeing and educational outcomes of CYP, excluding impacts of closure on transmission of infection (PROSPERO CRD42020181658). We used a machine learning approach for screening articles, with decisions on inclusion and data extraction performed independently by 2 researchers. Quality was assessed for study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken as data did not allow meta-analysis.

Results16,817 records were screened, of which 151 were reviewed in full-text and 72 studies were included from 20 countries. 33% were cohort studies using historical control periods; 19% pre-post studies; and 46% cross-sectional studies which assessed change by comparison with population reference data. 63% were high-quality, 25% medium-quality and 13% low-quality. Cause of closure in all studies was the first COVID-19 pandemic wave with the exception of 5 influenza studies and 1 teacher strike.

27 studies concerning mental health identified considerable impacts across emotional, behavioural and restlessness/inattention problems; 18-60% of CYP scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms. Two studies reported non-significant rises in suicide rates. Self-harm and psychiatric attendances were markedly reduced, indicating a rise in unmet mental health need. Child protection referrals fell 27-39%, with a halving of the expected number of referrals originating in schools.

19 studies concerning health service use showed marked reductions in emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions, with evidence of delayed presentations and potential widening of inequalities in vaccination coverage. Data suggested marked rises in screen-time and social media use and reductions in physical activity however data on sleep and diet were inconclusive. Available data suggested likely higher harms in CYP from more deprived populations.

ConclusionsSchool closures as part of broader social distancing measures are associated with considerable harms to CYP health and wellbeing. Available data are short-term and longer-term harms are likely to be magnified by further school closures. Data are urgently needed on longer-term impacts using strong research designs, particularly amongst vulnerable groups.

226,The Missing Science: Epidemiological data gaps for COVID-19 policy in the United States,"We report on a scoping study of COVID-19 epidemiological data available for COVID-19 policy and management decisions for U.S. settings. We synthesize current US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates for parameter of infectious transmission, infection severity, and disease burden, and summarize epidemiologic contributions to these parameters published by CDC-affiliated investigators through Oct 30, 2020. Authoritative estimates of most infectious transmission and infection severity parameters exist but rely primarily on data from studies conducted in non-U.S. populations. Estimates of secondary infection risks for household, workplace, school, or other community settings are lacking and estimates of the clinical fraction remain uncertain. The CDC reports multiple disease incidence and prevalence measures at national and state geographies, including some measures disaggregated by age group, race/ethnicity and sex; however, nationally uniform disease burden measures are not available at the sub-state level or for sub-populations defined by exposure setting, limiting opportunities for targeted interventions. CDC-affiliated investigators authored 133 quantitative studies on COVID-19 through Oct 30, 2020; however only 34 employed analytic methods. The remainder were descriptive. Of the 34 analytic studies, eleven reported on risk factors for infection, seven reported on risk factors for severe disease, three on symptomatic infections, three reported secondary infection risks, and four reported on indirect pandemic effects. Gaps remain in the epidemiological data required for an efficient and equitable public health policy response to COVID-19.

227,'Leading from the front implementation strategies increase the success of influenza vaccination drives among healthcare workers: A reanalysis of Systematic Review evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA),"BackgroundSeasonal influenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) is widely recommended to protect staff and patients. A previous systematic review examined interventions to encourage uptake finding that hard mandates, such as loss of employment for non-vaccination, were more effective than soft mandates, such as signing a declination form, or other interventions such as incentives. Despite these overarching patterns the authors of the review concluded that  substantial heterogeneity remained requiring further analysis. This paper reanalyses the evidence using Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine whether the strategies used to implement interventions explain the residual heterogeneity.

MethodsWe used ICA to extract implementation features and trialists reflections on what underpinned the success of the intervention they evaluated. The ICA findings then informed and structured two QCA analyses to systematically analyse associations between implementation features and intervention outcomes. Analysis 1 examined hard mandate studies. Analysis 2 examined soft mandates and other interventions.

ResultsIn Analysis 1 ICA revealed the significance of  leading from the front rather than  top-down implementation of hard mandates. Four key features underpinned this: providing education prior to implementation; two-way engagement so HCW can voice concerns prior to implementation; previous use of other strategies so that institutions  dont-go-in-cold with hard-mandates; and support from institutional leadership. QCA revealed that either of two configurations were associated with greater success of hard mandates. The first involves two-way engagement, leadership support and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. The second involves leadership support, education and a  dont-go-in-cold approach. Reapplying the  leading from the front theory in Analysis 2 revealed similar patterns.

ConclusionsRegardless of intervention type a  leading from the front approach to implementation will likely enhance intervention success.

228,Evaluating COVID-19 reporting data in the context of testing strategies across 31 LMICs,"0.1. BackgroundCOVID-19 case counts are the predominant measure used to track epidemiological dynamics and inform policy decision-making. Case counts, however, are influenced by testing rates and strategies, which have varied over time and space. A method to consistently interpret COVID-19 case counts in the context of other surveillance data is needed, especially for data-limited settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

0.2. MethodsWe leverage statistical analyses to detect changes in COVID-19 surveillance data. We apply the pruned exact linear time change detection method for COVID-19 case counts, number of tests, and test positivity rate over time. With this information, we categorize change points as likely driven by epidemiological dynamics or non-epidemiological influences such as noise.

0.3. FindingsHigher rates of epidemiological change detection are more associated with open testing policies than with higher testing rates. The non-pharmaceutical intervention most correlated with epidemiological change is workplace closing. LMICs have the testing capacity to measure prevalence with precision if they use randomized testing. Rwanda stands out as a country with an efficient COVID-19 surveillance system. Sub-national data reveal heterogeneity in epidemiological dynamics and surveillance.

0.4. InterpretationRelying solely on case counts to interpret pandemic dynamics has important limitations. Normalizing counts by testing rate mitigates some of these limitations, and open testing policy is key to efficient surveillance. Our findings can be leveraged by public health officials to strengthen COVID-19 surveillance and support programmatic decision-making.

In this paper we present a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying whether a given patient (actually infected or suspected to be infected) is more likely to survive than to die, or vice-versa. We train this algorithm with historical data, including medical history, demographic data, as well as COVID-19-related information. This is extracted from a database of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections in Mexico, constituting the official COVID-19 data compiled and made publicly available by the Mexican Federal Government. We demonstrate that the proposed method can detect high-risk patients with high accuracy, in each of four identified treatment stages, thus improving hospital capacity planning and timely treatment. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to provide optimal estimators for hypothesis-testing techniques commonly-used in biological and medical statistics. We believe that our work could be of use in the context of the current pandemic in assisting medical professionals with real-time assessments so as to determine health care priorities.",Mario A.

230,The global distribution of COVID-19 vaccine: The role of macro-socioeconomics measures,"Since coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has continued to spread globally, many countries have progressed clinical trials and started vaccinations at the end of December 2020. This report aims to analyze the association of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and two macro-socioeconomics measures, including human development index (HDI) and Gross domestic product (GDP), among 25 countries till the first week of February 2021. Our results indicate that a higher GDP per Capita is positively associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine distribution. However, UAE and Israel have more successful vaccine distribution outcomes regardless of their GDP. In addition, the result shows HDI does not have a significant relationship with vaccine distribution. Although these macro-socioeconomic measures may be counted as a vital indicator for vaccine distribution, other factors may play roles in vaccine distribution, including well-developed health infrastructure, a centralized political system, and population size.",Ali Roghani; Samin Panahi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251436,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251436,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
231,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and symptoms in an Irish Healthcare Worker (HCW) setting: Results of the COVID Antibody Staff Testing (CAST) Study,"ObjectivesThis study examined the natural history, including incidence and prevalence, of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies serially up to 6 months post infection in Irish Healthcare Workers (HCWs) at an academic tertiary maternity hospital, during the first pandemic peak from March to September 2020.

DesignThis single centre observational study profiled SARS-CoV-2 incidence and infection using viral RNA detected using oro/nasopharyngeal swabs accompanied by serological assessment of study participants for the presence of S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participant demographics were also collected alongside information on clinical symptoms and time to recovery. Real time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 three gene target 2019-nCoV assay (SeeGene Inc., Rep. of Korea) or the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay on the GeneXpert platform (Cepheid, USA). Blood samples were obtained at the time of initial swab and at up to 4 time points thereafter, for the serological assessment of antibodies against both the spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Serological response was measured using the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) as part of a clinical performance evaluation. Two other testing methods were also used; the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay (EuroImmun) and the Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG 75 kit on the Architect i2000SR instrument (Abbott Laboratories).

SettingAcademic Tertiary Maternity Hospital in Dublin, Ireland.

ParticipantsWe invited symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers employed at the Rotunda Maternity Hospital to participate in the CAST study.

Main Outcome MeasuresThe CAST study aimed to examine incidence and clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs and to determine the presence and longevity of antibodies in this group. We also sought to examine the clinical utility of the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) and to compare it to the current ""accepted"" gold standard platform in Ireland.

ResultsBy July 2020, 398 molecular tests had been completed on symptomatic staff with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this cohort, 14% (n=54/398) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. The CAST study enrolled 137 HCWs with 86 participants symptomatic at time of swab collection and a further 51 asymptomatic control participants. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 52% (n=45/86) symptomatic study participants and serological positivity was confirmed in 98% (n=44/45) of those participants. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RNA infection was detected in 4% (n=2/51) of control participants with a seropositivity rate in this group of 8% (n=4/51). We demonstrated that 95% of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants have detectable levels of antibodies at 100 days post infection, which persisted in 91% of participants at day 160+. Ongoing symptoms up to six months post infection were present in 50% of study participants with positive PCR and serology results. These data will be important to consider for long-term workforce planning in a healthcare setting, as the ongoing pandemic continues.

232,"Risk Perceptions, Knowledge and Behaviors of General and High-Risk Adult Populations towards COVID-19: A Systematic Scoping Review","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a major crisis for governments and populations around the globe. A large number of studies have been conducted worldwide to understand peoples awareness and behavioral response towards the disease. The publics risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors are key factors that play a vital role in the transmission of infectious diseases. Our scoping review aims to map the early evidence on risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors of general and high-risk adult populations towards COVID-19.

MethodsA systematic scoping review was conducted of peer-reviewed articles in five databases (MEDLINE-Ovid, EMBASE-Ovid, PsycINFO-Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL-EBSCO) on studies conducted during the early stage of COVID-19 (January to June, 2020). The gray literature was also searched through Open Grey, Scopus, Wonder, Social Science Research Network, MedRxiv, and websites of major public health organizations. Twenty studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included, appraised and analyzed.

ResultsDuring the early stage of the pandemic, levels of risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19 were moderate to high in both general and high-risk adult populations. The perceived severity of the disease was slightly higher than the perceived susceptibility of getting COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19. Adults were knowledgeable about preventive behaviors, including hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing, and avoidance behaviors. Nevertheless, an important knowledge gap regarding the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 was reported in many studies. Our review identified hand-washing and avoiding crowded places as dominant preventive behaviors at the early stage of the pandemic. Staying at home, reducing social contacts, and avoiding public transport were less widespread in general populations than in high-risk adult groups. Being a female, older, and more educated was associated with better knowledge of COVID-19 and appropriate preventive behaviors.

ConclusionThis scoping review offers a first understanding of general and high-risk adults risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should be undertaken to assess psychological and behavioral responses over time. Research gaps have been identified in the relationship between ethnicity and risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors towards COVID-19.

Contribution to the field statementSince the beginning of the pandemic, a large number of primary studies have been conducted worldwide to understand peoples awareness and behavioral response towards COVID-19. Nevertheless, no review has mapped the early evidence on the perceptions, knowledge, and preventive behaviors of adult populations towards the transmission of this new disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scoping review that offers an understanding of the general and high-risk adults risk perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors (RPKB) towards COVID-19 during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review also identified sociodemographic factors associated with adults RPKB regarding COVID-19. As the virus does not affect individuals equally, knowing these factors can help to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 in certain population groups by developing targeted communication strategies that will facilitate their engagement in preventive measures. Finally, research gaps have been identified in the relationship between ethnicity and RPKB towards COVID-19. The existence of a disproportionate number of COVID-19 fatalities within Black populations should signal the possible gaps in RPKB towards COVID-19 in these communities. Additional studies on ethnic health disparities can help public health authorities to introduce targeted actions towards these communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",nathalie clavel; Janine Badr; Lara Gautier; Melanie Lavoie-Tremblay,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21250257,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21250257,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
233,Development of a new Aerosol Barrier Mask for mitigation of spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused huge impact on public health and significantly changed our lifestyle. This is due to the fast airborne oro-nasal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the infected individuals. The generation of liquid aerosolized particles occurs when the COVID-19 patients speak, sing, cough, sneeze, or simply breathe. We have developed a novel aerosol barrier mask (ABM) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens. This Aerosol Barrier Mask is designed for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission while transporting patients within hospital facilities. This mask can constrain aerosol and droplet particles and trap them in a biofilter, while the patient is normally breathing and administrated with medical oxygen. The system can be characterized as an oxygen delivery and mitigation mask which has no unfiltered exhaled air dispersion. The mask helps to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other infectious respiratory pathogens and protects everyone in general, especially healthcare professionals.",Karam R Abi Karam; Piyush Hota; Sabrina Jimena Mora; Amelia Lowell; Kelly McKay; Xiaojun Xian; Bhavesh Patel; Erica Forzani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251593,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.11.21251593,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
234,CLINICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE CALL SCORE FOR THE PREDICTION OF ADMISSION TO ICU AND DEATH IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 PNEUMONIA IN A REFERENCE HOSPITAL IN PERU,"ObjectiveDetermine the CALL SCOREs diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of ICU admission and death in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in a reference hospital in Peru.

MethodsWe performed an analytical cross-sectional observational study. We included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated at the ""Dos de Mayo"" National Hospital. Patients over 18 years old with a diagnosis confirmed by rapid or molecular testing were included. Those with an incomplete, illegible, or missing medical history and/or bacterial or fungal pneumonia were excluded. Data were extracted from medical records. The primary outcomes were mortality and admission to the ICU. The Call Score was calculated for each patient (4 to 13 points) and classified into three risk groups. Summary measures were presented for qualitative and quantitative variables. The area under the model curve and the operational characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) were calculated for the best cut-off point.

ResultsThe Call Score reported an area under the curve of 0.59 (IC95%: 0.3 to 0.07), p = 0.43 for predicting death. However, for a cut-off point of 5.5, a sensitivity of 87%and a specificity of 65%were obtained. The area under the curve for ICU admission was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.3 to 0.07), p = 0.43; the 5.5 cut-off point showed a sensitivity of 82%and a specificity of 51%.

235,Outcomes of COVID-19 among Patients with End Stage Renal Disease on Remdesivir,"BACKGROUNDSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been widespread use of remdesivir in adults and children. There is little known information about its outcomes in patients with severe renal dysfunction or end-stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis.

METHODSA retrospective, multicenter study was conducted on patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis that were discharged after treatment for COVID-19 between April 1st and December 31st, 2020. Primary endpoints were the length of stay, mortality, maximum oxygen requirements along with the escalation of care needing mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints included change in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition.

RESULTSA total of 52 charts were reviewed, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria. 14 patients received remdesivir, and 14 patients did not receive remdesivir. The majority of patients were caucasian, female, with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The mean age was 65.33 +14.14 years. All the patients in the remdesivir group received dexamethasone as compared to only 30% of patients in the non-remdesivir group. There was no significant difference in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition between the two groups. Approximately 35% of the patients died, 18% required intensive ventilation, and the mean length of stay was 12.21 days.

DISCUSSIONThe study demonstrated no clinically significant difference in length of stay, maximum oxygen requirements, or mortality in COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease in the remdesivir group as compared to the non-remdesivir group. Further studies are needed to study the effects of remdesivir on the renal function and disease course in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5 that are not on dialysis.",Vijairam Selvaraj; Muhammad Baig; Kwame Dapaah-Afriyie; Arkadiy Finn; Atin Jindal; George Bayliss,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251527,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.21251527,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True
236,Returning to nursing during the COVID-19 pandemic: experiences and needs of re-entering nurses,"AimAssessing the needs and experiences of re-entering nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands, thousands of former nurses have returned to nursing to support healthcare staff. After a period of absence and with little time to prepare, these former nurses re-entered during a challenging, uncertain and rapidly evolving pandemic. Little is known about the experiences and needs of these re-entering nurses.

DesignQualitative study

MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 purposively selected nurses who had re-entered nursing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed via thematic content analysis. This study followed the COREQ guidelines.

ResultsParticipants mentioned that a lack of a clear job description led to unclarity about the kind of tasks that re-entering nurses were expected and allowed to perform. This unclarity was especially notable in the newly established COVID-19 departments. Re-entering nurses mentioned to wish for an easily accessible mentorship structure and an individualised and practical training program. Re-entering nurses felt supported by a positive team dynamic, which was shaped by the sense of urgency and relevance of their work and helped them deal with stressful experiences.

ConclusionThe results indicate that a rapid and safe return to nursing during a pandemic could be facilitated by: a clear description of roles and responsibilities; an individualised assessment determining the competences and knowledge disparities of re-entering nurses; practical training focussing on competencies needed during a pandemic; and a collaborative mentorship structure to guide re-entering nurses.

Relevance to clinical practiceThe rapid recruitment of former nurses to mitigate an acute shortage of qualified nurses could play a vital role during a pandemic. To deploy these nurses effectively, safely and sustainably, it is important to address the needs of these re-entering nurses.

What does this paper contribute towards the wider global clinical community?O_LIThis research showed the need to prepare a flexible individualised training programme which could support re-entering nurses during crisis situations, such as a pandemic.
C_LIO_LIA responsive mentorship structure helps to provide support to re-entering nurses in a dynamic, uncertain and rapidly evolving situation.

237,Evaluation of Facial Protection Against Close-Contact Droplet Transmission,"BackgroundFace shields are used as an alternative to facemasks, but their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. The goal of this study is to compare the performance of face shields, surgical facemasks, and cloth facemasks for mitigation of droplet transmission during close contact conditions.

MethodsA novel test system was developed to simulate droplet transmission during close contact conditions using two breathing headforms (transmitter and receiver) placed 4 feet apart with one producing droplets containing a DNA marker. Sampling coupons were placed throughout the test setup and subsequently analyzed for presence of DNA marker using quantitative PCR.

ResultsAll PPE donned on the transmitter headform provided a significant reduction in transmission of DNA marker to the receiver headform: cloth facemask (78.5%), surgical facemask (89.4%), and face shield (96.1%). All PPE resulted in increased contamination of the eye region of the transmitter headform (9,525.4% average for facemasks and 765.8% for the face shield). Only the face shield increased contamination of the neck region (207.4%), with the cloth facemask and surgical facemask resulting in reductions of 85.9% and 90.2%, respectively.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates face shields can provide similar levels of protection against direct droplet exposure compared to surgical and cloth masks. However, all PPE tested resulted in release of particles that contaminated surfaces. Contamination caused by deflection of the users exhalation prompts concerns for contact transmission via surfaces in exhalation flow path (e.g., face, eyeglasses, etc.).",Thomas B Stephenson; Courtney Cumberland; Geoff Kibble; Christopher Church; Sheila Nogueira-Prewitt; Sebastian MacNamara; Delbert A Harnish; Brian K Heimbuch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251443,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251443,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,True

Long term use of spectacles may prevent repeated touching and rubbing of the eyes. Aim of the study is to compare the risk of COVID-19 in long term spectacles wearers with the risk in persons not using spectacles.

ObjectivesTo know the association between infection with SARSCoV-2 and wearing of spectacles.

Materials and methodsIn this study, 304 patients of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were selected. Their spectacles wearing behaviour was assessed through a questionnaire. Spectacles wearing behaviour of general population was obtained from older studies (for comparison). Risk of COVID-19 was calculated in long term spectacles wearers as well as in persons not using spectacles. Chi-Square test was used for statistical analysis.

ResultsIn this study, total 58 patients showed the behavior of using spectacles continuously during day time and always on outdoor activities. The risk of COVID-19 was found 0.48 in spectacles wearing population as compared to 1.35 in population not using spectacles. The calculated risk ratio was 0.36. The protective effectiveness of the spectacles was found statistically significant (p-value .00113).

ConclusionThe present study showed that the risk of Covid-19 was about 2-3 times less in spectacles wearing population than the population not wearing those.

239,Deep learning models for COVID-19 chest x-ray classification: Preventing shortcut learning using feature disentanglement,"In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, recent research has proposed creating deep learning based models that use chest radiographs (CXRs) in a variety of clinical tasks to help manage the crisis. However, the size of existing datasets of CXRs from COVID-19+ patients are relatively small, and researchers often pool CXR data from multiple sources, for example, using different x-ray machines in various patient populations under different clinical scenarios. Deep learning models trained on such datasets have been shown to overfit to erroneous features instead of learning pulmonary characteristics - a phenomenon known as shortcut learning. We propose adding feature disentanglement to the training process, forcing the models to identify pulmonary features from the images while penalizing them for learning features that can discriminate between the original datasets that the images come from. We find that models trained in this way indeed have better generalization performance on unseen data; in the best case we found that it improved AUC by 0.13 on held out data. We further find that this outperforms masking out non-lung parts of the CXRs and performing histogram equalization, both of which are recently proposed methods for removing biases in CXR datasets.",Caleb Robinson; Anusua Trivedi; Marian Blazes; Anthony Ortiz; Jocelyn Desbiens; Sunil Gupta; Rahul Dodhia; Pavan K Bhatraju; W.

There is an urgent need for antivirals targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus to fight the current COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) represents a promising target for antiviral therapy. The lack of selectivity for some of the reported 3CLpro inhibitors, specifically versus cathepsin L, raises potential safety and efficacy concerns. ALG-097111 potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (IC50 = 7 nM) without affecting the activity of human cathepsin L (IC50 > 10 M). When ALG-097111 was dosed in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2, a robust and significant 3.5 log10 (RNA copies/mg) reduction of the viral RNA copies and 3.7 log10 (TCID50/mg) reduction in the infectious virus titers in the lungs was observed.

241,"Potent, Novel SARS-CoV-2 PLpro Inhibitors Block Viral Replication in Monkey and Human Cell Cultures","Antiviral agents blocking SARS-CoV-2 viral replication are desperately needed to complement vaccination to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Viral replication and assembly are entirely dependent on two viral cysteine proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro also has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifications from host proteins, disrupting the host immune response. 3CLpro is inhibited by many known cysteine protease inhibitors, whereas PLpro is a relatively unusual cysteine protease, being resistant to blockade by such inhibitors. A high-throughput screen of biased and unbiased libraries gave a low hit rate, identifying only CPI-169 and the positive control, GRL0617, as inhibitors with good potency (IC50 < 10 {micro}M). Analogues of both inhibitors were designed to develop structure-activity relationships; however, without a co-crystal structure of the CPI-169 series, we focused on GRL0617 as a starting point for structure-based drug design, obtaining several co-crystal structures to guide optimization. A series of novel 2-phenylthiophene-based non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors were obtained, culminating in low nanomolar potency. The high potency and slow inhibitor off-rate were rationalized by newly identified ligand interactions with a ""BL2 groove"" that is distal from the active site cysteine. Trapping of the conformationally flexible BL2 loop by these inhibitors blocks binding of viral and host protein substrates; however, until now it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can induce potent and efficacious antiviral activity. In this study, we report that novel PLpro inhibitors have excellent antiviral efficacy and potency against infectious SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures. Together, our data provide structural insights into the design of potent PLpro inhibitors and the first validation that non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro can block infection of human cells with low micromolar potency.",Zhengnan Shen; Kiira Ratia; Laura Cooper; Deyu Kong; Hyun Lee; Youngjin Kwon; Yangfeng Li; Saad Alqarni; Fei Huang; Oleksii Dubrovskyi; Lijun Rong; Gregory RJ Thatcher; RUI XIONG,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.431008,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.13.431008,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False
242,Mutation N501Y in RBD of Spike Protein Strengthens the Interaction between COVID-19 and its Receptor ACE2,"SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world for the past year. Enormous efforts have been taken to understand its mechanism of transmission. It is well established now that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its first step of entry. Being a single-stranded RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is evolving rapidly. Recently, several variants such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, with a key mutation N501Y on the RBD, appear to be more infectious to humans. To understand its mechanism, we combined cell surface binding assay, kinetics study, single-molecule technique, and computational method to investigate the interaction between these RBD (mutations) and ACE2. Remarkably, RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a considerably stronger interaction characterized from all these methodologies, while the other two mutations from B.1.351 contributed to a less effect. Fluorescence-activated cell scan (FACS) assays found that RBD N501Y mutations are of higher binding affinity to ACE2 than the wild type. Surface plasmon resonance further indicated that N501Y mutation had a faster association rate and slower dissociation rate. Consistent with the kinetics study, atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force microscopy quantify their strength on living cells, showing a higher binding probability and unbinding force for the mutation. Finally, Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations on the dissociation of RBD-ACE2 complexes revealed that the N501Y introduced additional {pi}-{pi} and {pi}-cation interaction for the higher force/interaction. Taken together, we suggested that the reinforced interaction from N501Y mutation in RBD should play an essential role in the higher transmission of COVID-19 variants.",Fang Tian; Bei Tong; Liang Sun; Shengchao Shi; Bin Zheng; Zibin Wang; Xianchi Dong; Peng Zheng,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431117,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.431117,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,,False

A physical distancing intensity framework comprising 16 domains was recently published to compare physical distancing approaches between U.S. States. We applied this framework to a diverse set of low and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Botswana, India, Jamaica, Mozambique, Namibia, and Ukraine) to test the appropriateness of this framework in the global context and to compare the policy responses in this set of LMICs and with a sample of U.S. States during the first 100-days of the epidemic.

ResultsAll six of the LMICs in our sample adopted wide ranging physical distancing policies. The highest peak daily physical distancing intensity in each country was: Botswana (4.60); India (4.40); Ukraine (4.40); Namibia (4.20); and Jamaica (3.80). The number of days each country stayed at peak intensity ranged from 12-days (Jamaica) to more than 67-days (Mozambique). We found some key similarities and differences, including substantial differences in whether and how countries expressly required certain groups to stay at home. We also found that the LMICs generally implemented physical distancing policies when there were few confirmed cases and the easing of physical distancing policies did not discernably correlate with change in COVID-19 incidence. The physical distancing responses in the LMIC sample were generally more intense than in a sample of U.S. States, but results vary depending on the U.S. State. For example, California had a peak intensity of 4.29, which would place California below the peak intensity for Botswana, India, and Ukraine but above Mozambique, Namibia and Jamaica. The U.S. State of Georgia had a peak intensity of 3.07, which would place it lower than all of the LMICs in this sample. The peak intensity for the U.S. 12-state average was 3.84, which would place it lower than every LMIC in this sample except Jamaica.

245,"CATALYST trial protocol: A multicentre, open-label, phase II, multi-arm trial for an early and accelerated evaluation of the potential treatments for COVID-19 in hospitalised adults","IntroductionSevere SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a dysregulated immune response. Inflammatory monocytes and macrophages are crucial, promoting injurious, pro-inflammatory sequelae. Immunomodulation is, therefore, an attractive therapeutic strategy and we sought to test licensed and novel candidate drugs.

Methods and analysisThe CATALYST trial is a multi-arm, open-label, multi-centre, phase II platform trial designed to identify candidate novel treatments to improve outcomes of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with usual care. Treatments with evidence of biomarker improvements will be put forward for larger-scale testing by current national phase III platform trials. Hospitalised patients >16 years with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (confirmed by chest X-ray or CT scan, with or without a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay) and a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) [&ge;]40 mg/L are eligible. The primary outcome measure is CRP, measured serially from admission to day 14, hospital discharge or death. Secondary outcomes include the WHO Clinical Progression Improvement Scale as a principal efficacy assessment.

Ethics and disseminationThe protocol was approved by the East Midlands - Nottingham 2 Research Ethics Committee (20/EM/0115) and given Urgent Public Health status; initial approval was received on 05-May-2020, current protocol version (v6.0) approval on 12-Oct-2020. The MHRA also approved all protocol versions. The results of this trial will be disseminated through national and international presentations and peer-reviewed publications.

246,"A genetically-informed study disentangling the relationships between tobacco smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, substance use disorders and respiratory infections, including COVID-19","BackgroundObservational studies suggest smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, cannabis use, and substance use disorders (SUDs) may play a role in the susceptibility for respiratory infections and disease, including coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019). However, causal inference is challenging due to comorbid substance use.

MethodsUsing genome-wide association study data of European ancestry (data from >1.7 million individuals), we performed single-variable and multivariable Mendelian randomization to evaluate relationships between smoking, cannabis use, alcohol consumption, SUDs, and respiratory infections.

ResultsGenetically predicted lifetime smoking was found to be associated with increased risk for hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR)=4.039, 95% CI 2.335-6.985, P-value=5.93x10-7) and very severe hospitalized COVID-19 (OR=3.091, 95% CI, 1.883-5.092, P-value=8.40x10-6). Genetically predicted lifetime smoking was also associated with increased risk pneumoniae (OR=1.589, 95% CI, 1.214-2.078, P-value=7.33x10-4), lower respiratory infections (OR=2.303, 95% CI, 1.713-3.097, P-value=3.40x10-8), and several others. Genetically predicted cannabis use disorder (CUD) was associated with increased bronchitis risk (OR=1.078, 95% CI, 1.020-1.128, P-value=0.007).

ConclusionsWe provide strong genetic evidence showing smoking increases the risk for respiratory infections and diseases even after accounting for other substance use and abuse.

248,Human liver organoid derived intra-hepatic bile duct cells support SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication and its comparison with SARS-CoV,"BackgroundAlthough the main route of infection for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the respiratory tract, liver injury is also commonly seen in many patients, as evidenced by deranged parenchymal liver enzymes. Furthermore, patients with severe liver disease have been shown to have higher mortality. Overall, the mechanism behind the liver injury remains unclear.

Approach and resultsWe showed that intra-hepatic bile duct cells could be grown using a human liver organoid platform. The cholangiocytes were not only susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, they also supported efficient viral replication. We also showed that SARS-CoV-2 replication was much higher than SARS-CoV.

249,"Integrated plasma proteomic and single-cell immune signaling network signatures demarcate mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19","The biological determinants of the wide spectrum of COVID-19 clinical manifestations are not fully understood. Here, over 1400 plasma proteins and 2600 single-cell immune features comprising cell phenotype, basal signaling activity, and signaling responses to inflammatory ligands were assessed in peripheral blood from patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, at the time of diagnosis. Using an integrated computational approach to analyze the combined plasma and single-cell proteomic data, we identified and independently validated a multivariate model classifying COVID-19 severity (multi-class AUCtraining = 0.799, p-value = 4.2e-6; multi-class AUCvalidation = 0.773, p-value = 7.7e-6). Features of this high-dimensional model recapitulated recent COVID-19 related observations of immune perturbations, and revealed novel biological signatures of severity, including the mobilization of elements of the renin-angiotensin system and primary hemostasis, as well as dysregulation of JAK/STAT, MAPK/mTOR, and NF-{kappa}B immune signaling networks. These results provide a set of early determinants of COVID-19 severity that may point to therapeutic targets for the prevention of COVID-19 progression.

SummaryFeyaerts et al. demonstrate that an integrated analysis of plasma and single-cell proteomics differentiates COVID-19 severity and reveals severity-specific biological signatures associated with the dysregulation of the JAK/STAT, MAPK/mTOR, and NF-{kappa}B immune signaling networks and the mobilization of the renin-angiotensin and hemostasis systems.",Dorien Feyaerts; Julien Hedou; Joshua Gillard; Han Chen; Eileen S Tsai; Laura S Peterson; Kazuo Ando; Monali Manohar; Evan Do; Gopal K.R.

250,A single-cell atlas of lymphocyte adaptive immune repertoires and transcriptomes reveals age-related differences in convalescent COVID-19 patients,"COVID-19 disease outcome is highly dependent on adaptive immunity from T and B lymphocytes, which play a critical role in the control, clearance and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2. To date, there is limited knowledge on the composition of the T and B cell immune receptor repertoires [T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs)] and transcriptomes in convalescent COVID-19 patients of different age groups. Here, we utilize single-cell sequencing (scSeq) of lymphocyte immune repertoires and transcriptomes to quantitatively profile the adaptive immune response in COVID-19 patients of varying age. We discovered highly expanded T and B cells in multiple patients, with the most expanded clonotypes coming from the effector CD8+ T cell population. Highly expanded CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clones show elevated markers of cytotoxicity (CD8: PRF1, GZMH, GNLY; CD4: GZMA), whereas clonally expanded B cells show markers of transition into the plasma cell state and activation across patients. By comparing young and old convalescent COVID-19 patients (mean ages = 31 and 66.8 years, respectively), we found that clonally expanded B cells in young patients were predominantly of the IgA isotype and their BCRs had incurred higher levels of somatic hypermutation than elderly patients. In conclusion, our scSeq analysis defines the adaptive immune repertoire and transcriptome in convalescent COVID-19 patients and shows important age-related differences implicated in immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",Florian Bieberich; Rodrigo Vazquez-Lombardi; Alexander Yermanos; Roy A Ehling; Derek M Mason; Bastian Wagner; Edo Kapetanovic; Raphael Brisset Di Roberto; Cedric R Weber; Miodrag Savic; Fabian Rudolf; Sai T Reddy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.430907,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.12.430907,2021-02-12,2021-02-12,,False

Some prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies have already showed striking effectiveness against COVID-19. Nevertheless, concerns remain about antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 as well as threats from other sarbecoviruses. Cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-related viruses provide opportunities to address such concerns. Here, we report on crystal structures of a cross-neutralizing antibody CV38-142 in complex with the receptor binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our structural findings provide mechanistic insights into how this antibody can accommodate antigenic variation in these viruses. CV38-142 synergizes with other cross-neutralizing antibodies, in particular COVA1-16, to enhance neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

While some mutations found in camel-derived MERS-CoV strains have been characterized, the majority of natural variation found across MERS-CoV isolates remains unstudied. Here we report on the environmental stability, replication kinetics and pathogenicity of several diverse isolates of MERS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 to serve as a basis of comparison with other stability studies. While most of the MERS-CoV isolates exhibited similar stability and pathogenicity in our experiments, the camel derived isolate, C/KSA/13, exhibited reduced surface stability while another camel isolate, C/BF/15, had reduced pathogenicity in a small animal model.

Until now, physical changes of blood cells have not been considered to play a role in COVID-19 related vascular occlusion and organ damage. Here we report an evaluation of multiple physical parameters including the mechanical features of five frequent blood cell types, namely erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils. More than 4 million blood cells of 17 COVID-19 patients at different levels of severity, 24 volunteers free from infectious or inflammatory diseases, and 14 recovered COVID-19 patients were analyzed.

Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains and examined their sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We established a novel rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become GFP+ after overnight infection. B.1.1.7 was neutralized by 79/83 sera from convalescent patients collected up to 9 months post symptoms, almost similar to D614G. There was a mean 6-fold reduction in titers and even loss of activity against B.1.351 in 40% of convalescent sera after 9 months. Early sera from 19 vaccinated individuals were almost as potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Nasal swabs from vaccine recipients were not neutralizing, except in individuals who were diagnosed COVID-19+ before vaccination.

256,Single-cell sequencing of plasma cells from COVID-19 patients reveals highly expanded clonal lineages produce specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"Isolation and characterization of antibodies in COVID-19 patients has largely focused on memory B cells, however it is the antibody-secreting plasma cells that are directly responsible for the production of serum antibodies, which play a critical role in controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date there is little known about the specificity of plasma cells in COVID-19 patients. This is largely because plasma cells lack surface antibody expression, which complicates their screening. Here, we describe a technology pipeline that integrates single-cell antibody repertoire sequencing and high-throughput mammalian display screening to interrogate the specificity of plasma cells from 16 convalescent COVID-19 patients. Single-cell sequencing allows us to profile antibody repertoire features in these patients and identify highly expanded clonal lineages. Mammalian display screening is employed to reveal that 37 antibodies (out of 132 candidates) derived from expanded plasma cell clonal lineages are specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including antibodies that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) with high affinity and exhibit potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.

258,Virus transmission by ultrasonic scaler and its prevention by antiviral agent,"During an ultrasonic scaler (USS) operation, droplets and aerosol are generated that may contribute to the transmission of viruses contained in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid. The purpose of this research was to develop an experimental model for testing the spread of viruses during USS instrumentation and to examining the prevention of spreading by replacing the coolant with an antiviral agent. In a virus transmission tunnel, USS operation with saline coolant and delivery of a viral suspension to the vicinity of USS tip generated droplets and aerosol containing Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV). Evaluation of droplet transmission was evaluated with adherent 48h cell culture monolayer RK13 cell lines in standard 48-well-plates positioned at a distance from 30 to 55 cm. The aerosol was collected by a cyclone aero-sampler flow of 100l/min. Antiviral activity of 0.25% sodium hypochlorite or electrolyzed water (EOW) was tested by suspension test. The two tested antiviral agents transmission prevention ability was evaluated by repeating the same experiment as with saline coolant. All experiments were repeated twice. With saline coolant, the cytopathic effect on cells was found in cells up to the distance of 45 cm, with the number of infected wells decreasing with distance. Viral particles were detected in only one AS in a very low concentration ([&le;]4.2 TCID50/ml). In suspension test of 0.25% NaOCl and EOW, the TCID50/ml was below detection limit after 5s. With both antiviral agents, no cytopathic effect was found. However, the cytotoxic effect of 0.25% NaOCl was evident up to the distance of 35 cm. By USS activity, EAV could be transmitted by droplets up to a distance of 45 cm. Both antiviral agents could prevent virus droplet transmission.

In the infected animals viral variants arose that harbored mutations in the spike (S) protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies, and these variants were transmitted back to humans. This raised concerns that mink might become a constant source of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with an increased threat to human health and resulted in mass culling of mink. Here, we report that mutations frequently found in the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from mink were mostly compatible with efficient entry into human cells and its inhibition by soluble ACE2. In contrast, mutation Y453F reduced neutralization by an antibody with emergency use authorization for COVID-19 therapy and by sera/plasma from COVID-19 patients.

However, their roles in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-causing coronavirus (CoV) infection are largely unknown. Herein we investigate their functions in human epithelial cells, the primary and initial target of SARS-CoV-2, and the first line of host defense. A deficiency in MDA5 (MDA5-/-), RIG-I or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) greatly enhanced viral replication. Expression of the type I/III interferons (IFN) was upregulated following infection in wild-type cells, while this upregulation was severely abolished in MDA5-/- and MAVS-/-, but not in RIG-I-/- cells.

261,Adjuvanting a subunit SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccine to induce protective immunity in non-human primates,"The development of a portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to vaccinate the global population remains an urgent public health imperative. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of a subunit vaccine under clinical development, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain displayed on a two-component protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP), to stimulate robust and durable neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates. We evaluated five different adjuvants combined with RBD-NP including Essai O/W 1849101, a squalene-in-water emulsion; AS03, an alpha-tocopherol-containing squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion used in pandemic influenza vaccines; AS37, a TLR-7 agonist adsorbed to Alum; CpG 1018-Alum (CpG-Alum), a TLR-9 agonist formulated in Alum; or Alum, the most widely used adjuvant. All five adjuvants induced substantial nAb and CD4 T cell responses after two consecutive immunizations. Durable nAb responses were evaluated for RBD-NP/AS03 immunization and the live-virus nAb response was durably maintained up to 154 days post-vaccination. AS03, CpG-Alum, AS37 and Alum groups conferred significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pharynges, nares and in the bronchoalveolar lavage. The nAb titers were highly correlated with protection against infection. Furthermore, RBD-NP when used in conjunction with AS03 was as potent as the prefusion stabilized Spike immunogen, HexaPro. Taken together, these data highlight the efficacy of the RBD-NP formulated with clinically relevant adjuvants in promoting robust immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates.",Prabhu S Arunachalam; Alexandra C Walls; Nadia Golden; Caroline Atyeo; Stephanie Fischinger; Chunfeng Li; Pyone Aye; Mary Jane Navarro; Lilin Lai; Venkata Viswanadh Edara; Katharina Roltgen; Kenneth Rogers; Lisa Shirreff; Douglas E Ferrell; Samuel Wrenn; Deleah Pettie; John C Kraft; Marcos C Miranda; Elizabeth Kepl; Claire Sydeman; Natalie Brunette; Michael Murphy; Brooke Fiala; Lauren Carter; Alexander G White; Meera Trisal; Ching-Lin Hsieh; Kasi Russell-Lodrigue; Christopher Monjure; Jason Dufour; Lara Doyle-Meyer; Rudolph B Bohm; Nicholas J Maness; Chad Roy; Jessica A Plante; Kenneth S Plante; Alex Zhu; Matthew J Gorman; Sally Shin; Xiaoying Shen; Jane Fontenot; Shakti Gupta; Derek T O Hagan; Robbert Van Der Most; Rino Rappuoli; Robert L Coffman; David Novack; Jason S McLellan; Shankar Subramaniam; David Montefiori; Scott D Boyd; JoAnne L Flynn; Galit Alter; Francois Villinger; Harry Kleanthous; Jay Rappaport; Mehul Suthar; Neil P King; David Veesler; Bali Pulendran,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430696,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.10.430696,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,False
262,Accelerating COVID-19 research with graph mining and transformer-based learning,"In 2020, the White House released the, ""Call to Action to the Tech Community on New Machine Readable COVID-19 Dataset,"" wherein artificial intelligence experts are asked to collect data and develop text mining techniques that can help the science community answer high-priority scientific questions related to COVID-19. The Allen Institute for AI and collaborators announced the availability of a rapidly growing open dataset of publications, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). As the pace of research accelerates, biomedical scientists struggle to stay current. To expedite their investigations, scientists leverage hypothesis generation systems, which can automatically inspect published papers to discover novel implicit connections. We present an automated general purpose hypothesis generation systems AGATHA-C and AGATHA-GP for COVID-19 research. The systems are based on graph-mining and the transformer model. The systems are massively validated using retrospective information rediscovery and proactive analysis involving human-in-the-loop expert analysis. Both systems achieve high-quality predictions across domains (in some domains up to 0.97% ROC AUC) in fast computational time and are released to the broad scientific community to accelerate biomedical research. In addition, by performing the domain expert curated study, we show that the systems are able to discover on-going research findings such as the relationship between COVID-19 and oxytocin hormone.

263,Clinical Validation of Automated and Rapid mariPOC SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test,"Novel SARS coronavirus causing COVID-19 was recognized in late 2019. Diagnostics was quickly ramped up worldwide based on the detection of viral RNA. Based on the scientific knowledge for pre-existing coronaviruses, it was expected that the RNA of this novel coronavirus will be detected at significant rates from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals due to existence of non-infectious RNA. To increase the efficacy of diagnostics, surveillance, screening and pandemic control, rapid methods, such as antigen tests, are needed for decentralized testing and to assess infectiousness. The objectives were to verify analytical sensitivity and specificity, and assess the clinical sensitivity, specificity and usability of a novel automated mariPOC SARS-CoV-2 test based on sophisticated optical laser technology detecting viral structure proteins. Analytical performance was verified using bacterial and viral preparations. Clinical performance of the test was evaluated against qRT-PCR in a retrospective study with nasopharyngeal swab specimens (N=211) collected from symptomatic patients suspected of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections. Sensitivity and specificity of the mariPOC test were 92.3% (12/13) and 100.0% (198/198), respectively. The test's limit of detection was 22 PFU/test and it had no cross-reactions with the tested respiratory microbes. Our study shows that the mariPOC can detect infectious individuals already in 20 minutes while clinical sensitivity close to qRT-PCR is achieved in two hours or less. The test targets conserved epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, making it robust against strain variations. The new test is a promising and versatile tool for syndromic testing of symptomatic cases and for high capacity infection control screening.",Juha M Koskinen; Petri Antikainen; Kristina Hotakainen; Anu Haveri; Niina Ikonen; Carita Savolainen-Kopra; Janne O Koskinen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21250086,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21250086,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,True

266,Country specific mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 in pre- and post-international travel ban: Effect on vaccine efficacy,"In order to curb the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2, nation-wide lockdowns were implemented as a preliminary measure. Since most countries enforced travel-bans during end of March 2020, the country-specific patterns should be discernible in the subsequent months. We identified frequently mutated non-synonymous mutations in 2,15,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences during pre and post-travel-ban periods in 35 countries. We further investigated the mutational profile on a bi-monthly basis and traced the progress over the time. Several new mutations have emerged post-travel-ban and on the rise in specific countries, chief among them being A222V and S477N in Spike, and A220V in Nucleocapsid protein. Consequently, we examined the Spike protein epitopes to inspect whether any of these country-specific mutations overlapped with these epitopes. Several mutations were found to be contained within one or more epitopes, including the highly mutated residues of Spike protein, advocating the requirement of active monitoring of vaccine efficacies in respective countries.",Sayantan Laha; Raghunath Chatterjee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251359,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251359,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,True
267,How much do superspreaders matter? Epidemic dynamics in inhomogeneous populations,"A variant of the SIR model for an inhomogeneous population is introduced in order to account for the effect of variability in susceptibility and infectiousness across a population. An initial formulation of this dynamics leads to infinitely many differential equations. Our model, however, can be reduced to a single first-order one-dimensional differential equation. Using this approach, we provide quantitative solutions for different distributions. In particular, we use GPS data from ~107 cellphones to determine an empirical distribution of the number of individual contacts and use this to infer a possible distribution of susceptibility and infectivity. We quantify the effect of superspreaders on the early growth rate R0 of the infection and on the final epidemic size, the total number of people who are ever infected. We discuss the features of the distribution that contribute most to the dynamics of the infection.",Kyle Kawagoe; Mark Rychnovsky; Serina Y Chang; Greg Huber; Lucy M Li; Jonathan Miller; Reuven Pnini; Boris Veytsman; David Yllanes,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251386,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251386,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,True
268,Combinatorial analysis of phenotypic and clinical risk factors associated with hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"1Characterization of the risk factors associated with variability in the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 is important. Our previous study using genomic data identified a potential role of calcium and lipid homeostasis in severe COVID-19. This study aimed to identify similar combinations of features (disease signatures) associated with severe disease in a separate patient population with purely clinical and phenotypic data.

The PrecisionLife combinatorial analytics platform was used to analyze features derived from de-identified health records in the UnitedHealth Group COVID-19 Data Suite. The platform identified and analyzed 836 disease signatures in two cohorts associated with increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Cohort 1 was formed of cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and a set of controls who developed mild symptoms. Cohort 2 included Cohort 1 individuals for whom additional laboratory test data was available.

We found several disease signatures where lower levels of lipids were found co-occurring with lower levels of serum calcium and leukocytes. Many of the low lipid signatures were independent of statin use and 50% of cases with hypocalcemia signatures were reported with vitamin D deficiency. These signatures may be attributed to similar mechanisms linking calcium and lipid signaling where changes in cellular lipid levels during inflammation and infection affect calcium signaling in host cells.

This study and our previous genomics analysis demonstrate that combinatorial analysis can identify disease signatures associated with the risk of developing severe COVID-19 separately from genomic or clinical data in different populations. Both studies suggest associations between calcium and lipid signalling in severe COVID-19.",Sayoni Das; Matthew Pearson; Krystyna Taylor; Veronique Bouchet; Gert Lykke Møller; Taryn O.

By the end of January, a third of the population has already been administered at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Efforts to estimate the true real-world effectiveness of the vaccine have been hampered by disease dynamics and social-economic discrepancies. Here, using counts of positive and hospitalized cases of vaccinated individuals, we provide sensitive estimations of the vaccine effectiveness by correcting to daily case incidence. We find high effectiveness of 66-85% in reducing SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and over 90% in reducing severe hospitalizations. As more granular data will be available more it will be possible to extract more exact estimates; however, there is little doubt that the vaccine is highly effective in reducing cases, hospitalizations and deaths.",Dvir Aran,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251139,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251139,2021-02-11,2021-02-11,,True

With this study, we wish to provide hospitalization, treatment and in-hospital outcome data for pulmonary embolism during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic and a corresponding 2016 - 2019 control period.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of claims data of Helios hospitals in Germany. Consecutive cases with a hospital admission between January 1 and December 15, 2020 and pulmonary embolism as primary discharge diagnosis were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period covering the same weeks in 2016 - 2019.

ResultsAs previously reported for other emergent medical conditions, there was a hospitalization deficit coinciding with the 1st pandemic wave. Beginning with the 12-week interval May 6 - July 28, there was a stable surplus of hospital admissions in 2020. During this surplus period (May 6 - December 15, 2020), there were 2,449 hospitalizations including 45 PCR-confirmed Covid-19 cases (1.8%) as opposed to 8,717 in 2016 - 2019 (IRR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.18, P<0.01). When excluding Covid-19 cases IRR was 1.10 (95% CI 1.05 - 1.15, P<0.01). While overall comorbidities expressed as weighted AHRQ Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (14.1 {+/-} 10.1 vs. 13.9 {+/-}10.3, P=0.28), the presence of thrombosis (46.1 vs 45.4%, P=0.55) and surgery (3.8 vs. 4.3%, P=0.33) were comparable, coagulopathy (3.3 vs 4.5%, P=0.01) and metastatic cancer (3.0 vs 4.0%, P=0.03) as contributing factors were less frequently observed during the 2020 surplus. Interventional treatments (thrombolytic therapy, thrombectomy or inferior vena cava filter placement) were less frequently used (4.7 vs 6.6%, OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 - 0.89, P< 0.01). Similarly, intensive care (35.1 vs 38.8%, OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 - 0.92, P< 0.01) and mechanical ventilation utilization (7.2 vs 8.1%, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.04, P=0.14) as well as in-hospital-mortality rates (7.8 vs 9.8%, OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 - 0.90, P< 0.01) were lower in 2020 compared with 2016 - 2019. This was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (6.4 {+/-}5.4 vs. 7.2 {+/-}5.7 days, P< 0.01) during the 2020 surplus period.

274,Hospitalizations for emergency-sensitive conditions in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic - Insights from the German-wide Helios hospital network,"BackgroundWhile there are numerous reports that describe emergency care during the early Covid-19 pandemic, there is scarcity of data for later stages. This study analyzes hospitalization rates for 37 emergency-sensitive conditions in the largest German-wide hospital network during different pandemic phases.

MethodsUsing claims data of 80 hospitals, consecutive cases between January 1 and November 17, 2020 were analyzed and compared to a corresponding period in 2019. Incidence-rate ratios (IRR) comparing the both periods were calculated using Poisson regression to model the number of hospitalizations per day.

ResultsThere was a hospitalization deficit between March 12 and June 13, 2020 (coinciding with the 1st pandemic wave) with 32,807 hospitalizations as opposed to 39,379 in 2019 (IRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.82 - 0.85, P<0.01). During the following period (June 14 to November 17, 2020, including the start of 2nd wave), hospitalizations were reduced from 63,799 in 2019 to 59,910 in 2020, but this reduction was not that pronounced (IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93 - 0.95, P<0.01). There was an increase in hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurism/dissection and pulmonary embolism after the 1st wave during which hospitalizations had been reduced for those conditions. In contrast, hospitalizations for sepsis, pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary disease, and intracranial injuries were reduced during the entire pandemic.

ConclusionsThere was an overall reduction of hospitalizations for emergency-sensitive conditions in Germany during the Covid-19 pandemic with heterogeneous effects on different disease categories. The increase of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction, aortic aneurism/dissection and pulmonary embolism is an alarming signal that requires attention and further studies.

Patient blood was comprehensively immunophenotyped via mass cytometry and multiplex cytokine arrays, leading to the identification of 327 basic subsets that were further stratified into more than 5000 immunotypes and correlated with 28 plasma cytokines. Low-density neutrophil abundance was closely correlated with hepatocyte growth factor levels, which in turn correlated with disease severity. Deep analysis also revealed additional players, namely conventional type 2 dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, plasmablasts and CD16+ monocytes, that can influence COVID-19 severity independent of temporal progression.

Recombinant or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and B.1.1.248 (Brazil) harbor mutations in the viral spike (S) protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to inhibitors and antibodies. Here, using pseudoparticles, we show that entry of UK, South Africa and Brazil variant into human cells is susceptible to blockade by entry inhibitors. In contrast, entry of the South Africa and Brazil variant was partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant to antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment and was less efficiently inhibited by serum/plasma from convalescent or BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals.

277,"Tocilizumab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): preliminary results of a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","Findings: Between 23 April 2020 and 25 January 2021, 4116 adults were included in the assessment of tocilizumab, including 562 (14%) patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, 1686 (41%) receiving non-invasive respiratory support, and. 1868 (45%) receiving no respiratory support other than oxygen. Median CRP was 143 [IQR 107-205] mg/L and 3385 (82%) patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids at randomisation. Overall, 596 (29%) of the 2022 patients allocated tocilizumab and 694 (33%) of the 2094 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.96; p=0.007). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients, including those receiving systemic corticosteroids. Patients allocated to tocilizumab were more likely to be discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (54% vs. 47%; rate ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.12-1.34; p<0.0001). Among those not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, patients allocated tocilizumab were less likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (33% vs. 38%; risk ratio 0.85; 95% CI 0.78-0.93; p=0.0005).

278,Novel SARS-CoV-2 spike variant identified through viral genome sequencing of the pediatric Washington D.C. COVID-19 outbreak,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has emerged as a global pandemic, severely impacting everyday life. Significant resources have been dedicated towards profiling the viral genome in the adult population. We present an analysis of viral genomes acquired from pediatric patients presenting to Childrens National Hospital in Washington D.C, including 24 with primary SARS CoV2 infection and 3 with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) undergoing treatment at our facility. Viral genome analysis using next generation sequencing indicated that approximately 81% of the analyzed strains were of the GH clade, 7% of the cases belonged to the GR clade, and 12% of the cases belonged to S, V, or G clades. One sample, acquired from a neonatal patient, presented with the highest viral RNA load of all patients evaluated at our center. Viral sequencing of this sample identified a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant, S:N679S. Analysis of data deposited in the GISAID global database of viral sequences shows the S:N679S variant is present in eight other sequenced samples within the US mid-Atlantic region. The similarity of the regional sequences suggests transmission and persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant within the Capitol region, raising the importance of increasing the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance.

IMPORTANCEA variant in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was identified in a febrile neonate who was hospitalized with COVID-19. This patient exhibited the highest viral RNA load of any COVID-19 patient tested at our center. Viral sequencing identified a spike protein variant, S:N679S, which is proximal to the cleavage site at residue 681. The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike is a protein trimer (three subunits) which serves as the key target for antibody therapies and vaccine development. Study of viral sequences from the GISAID database revealed eight related sequences from the US mid-Atlantic region. The identification of this variant in a very young patient, its critical location in the spike polyprotein, and the evidence that it has been detected in other patients in our region underscores the need for increased viral sequencing to monitor variant prevalence and emergence, which may have a direct impact on recommended public health measures and vaccination strategies.",Jonathan Edward LoTempio Jr.; Erik Antonio Billings; Kyah Draper; Christal Ralph; Madhi Moshgriz; Nhat Duong; Jennifer Dien Bard; Xiaowu Gai; David Wessel; Roberta L DeBiasi; Joseph M Campos; Eric Vilain; Meghan Delaney; Drew G Michael,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251344,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251344,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
279,"Expression of ACE2 receptor, soluble ACE2, Angiotensin I, Angiotensin II and Angiotensin (1-7), is modulated in COVID-19 patients.","Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a pulmonary-tropic virus, it is nonetheless responsible for multi-organ failure in patients with severe forms of COVID-19, particularly those with hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Infection requires virus binding to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) monocarboxypeptidase, a regulator of blood pressure homeostasis through its ability to catalyze the proteolysis of Angiotensin II (AngII) into Ang(1-7). Although assumed, it had not been proven so far whether the SARS-CoV-2 replication in COVID-19 patients could modulate the expression of the ACE2 receptor and/or the AngII plasma levels. We demonstrate here, that in COVID-19 patients the ACE2 mRNA expression is markedly reduced in circulating blood cells. This ACE2 gene dysregulation mainly affects the monocytes which also show a lower expression of membrane ACE2 protein. Moreover, a significant decrease in soluble ACE2 plasma levels is observed in COVID-19 patients, whereas the concentration of sACE2 returns to normal levels in patients recovered from COVID-19. In the plasma of COVID-19 patients, we also found an increase in AngI and AngII. On the other hand, the plasma levels of Ang(1-7) remains almost stable in COVID-19 patients. Despite the Ang(1-7) presence in the plasma of COVID-19 patients it seems insufficient to prevent the effects of massive AngII accumulation. These are the first direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 may affect the expression of blood pressure regulators with possible harmful consequences on COVID-19 outcome.",Ikram Omar OSMAN; Clea Menelotte Jr.; Philippe Brouqui; Matthieu MILLION; Jean-christophe LAGIER; Phillipe PAROLA; Andreas STEIN; Bernard LA SCOLA; Line MEDDEB; Jean-Louis MEGE; Didier RAOULT; Christian Albert DEVAUX,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251001,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251001,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
280,Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the Bronx enables clinical and epidemiological inference,"The Bronx was an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. We conducted temporal genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the Bronx from March-October 2020. Although the local structure of SARS-CoV-2 lineages mirrored those of New York City and New York State, temporal sampling revealed a dynamic and changing landscape of SARS- CoV-2 genomic diversity. Mapping the trajectories of variants, we found that while some have become 'endemic' to the Bronx, other, novel variants rose in prevalence in the late summer/early fall. Geographically resolved genomes enabled us to distinguish between a case of reinfection and a case of persistent infection.

281,Associations of DMT therapies with COVID-19 severity in multiple sclerosis,"Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are a vulnerable group for severe COVID-19, particularly those taking immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). We examined the characteristics of COVID-19 severity in an international sample of people with MS. Methods: Data from 12 data-sources in 28 countries were aggregated. Demographic and clinical covariates were queried, alongside COVID-19 clinical severity outcomes, hospitalisation, admission to ICU, requiring artificial ventilation, and death. Characteristics of outcomes were assessed in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression. Results: 657 (28.1%) with suspected and 1,683 (61.9%) with confirmed COVID-19 were analysed. Older age, progressive MS-phenotype, and higher disability were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.56,95%CI=1.01-2.41; aOR=2.43,95%CI=1.48-4.02) and ICU admission (aOR=2.30,95%CI=0.98-5.39; aOR=3.93,95%CI=1.56-9.89), though only rituximab was associated with higher risk of artificial ventilation (aOR=4.00,95%CI=1.54-10.39). Compared to pooled other DMTs, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.75,95%CI=1.29-2.38; aOR=2.76,95%CI=1.87-4.07) and ICU admission (aOR=2.55,95%CI=1.49-4.36; aOR=4.32,95%CI=2.27-8.23) but only rituximab with artificial ventilation (aOR=6.15,95%CI=3.09-12.27). Compared to natalizumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.86,95%CI=1.13-3.07; aOR=2.88,95%CI=1.68-4.92) and ICU admission (aOR=2.13,95%CI=0.85-5.35; aOR=3.23,95%CI=1.17-8.91), but only rituximab with ventilation (aOR=5.52,95%CI=1.71-17.84). Importantly, associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases. No associations were observed between DMTs and death. Conclusions: Using the largest cohort of people with MS and COVID-19 available, we demonstrated consistent associations of rituximab with increased risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and requiring artificial ventilation, and ocrelizumab with hospitalisation and ICU admission, suggesting their use may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19.",Steve Simpson-Yap; Edward De Brouwer; Tomas Kalincik; Nick Rijke; Jan Hillert; Clare Walton; Gilles Edan; YVES Yves MOREAU; Tim Spelman; Lotte Geys; Tina Parciak; Clement Gautrais; Nikola Lazovski; Ashkan Pirmani; Amin Ardeshirdavani; Lars Forsberg; Anna Glaser; Robert McBurney; Hollie Schmidt; Arnfin Bergmann; Stefan Braune; Alexander Stahmann; Rodden Middleton; Amber Salter; Robert J Fox; Anneke van der Walt; Helmut Butzkueven; Raed Al-Roughani; Serkan Ozakbas; Juan I Rojas; Ingrid van der Mei; Nupur Nag; Rumen Ivanov; Guilherme Sciascia do Olival; Alice Estavo Dias; Melinda Magyari; Doralina Guimaraes Brum; Maria Fernanda Mendes; Ricardo Alonso; Richard Nicholas; Johana Bauer; Anibal Chertcoff; Anna Zabalza; Georgina Arrambide; Alexander Fidao; Giancarlo Comi; Liesbet Peeters,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251316,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251316,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
282,"SARS-CoV-2 transmission, vaccination rate and the fate of resistant strains","Vaccines are thought to be the best available solution for controlling the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [1,2]. However, the emergence of vaccine-resistant strains [3-6] may come too rapidly for current vaccine developments to alleviate the health, economic and social consequences of the pandemic [7,8]. To quantify and characterize the risk of such a scenario, we created a SIR-derived model [9,10] with initial stochastic dynamics of the vaccine-resistant strain to study the probability of its emergence and establishment. Using parameters realistically resembling SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we model a wave-like pattern of the pandemic and consider the impact of the rate of vaccination and the strength of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the probability of emergence of a resistant strain. We found a counterintuitive result that the highest probability for the establishment of the resistant strain comes at a time of reduced non-pharmaceutical intervention measures when most individuals of the population have been vaccinated. Consequently, we show that a period of transmission reduction close to the end of the vaccination campaign can substantially reduce the probability of resistant strain establishment. Our results suggest that policymakers and individuals should consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions [7,11,12] throughout the entire vaccination period.",Simon Rella; Yuliya Kulikova; Emmanouil Dermitzakis; Fyodor Kondrashov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251383,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251383,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True

A first series of official published data from March 1st to May 31st, 2020 was used to adjust the model parameters aiming to forecast one year of the COVID-19 evolutionary outbreak. The cohort study was set as a city population-based analysis. The population-based sample, 25,366 during the study period, was the number of confirmed cases on exposed individuals. The analysis was applied to predict the consequences of releasing the NPIs, and indicated the appearance of a second wave starting last quarter of 2020.

284,"Assessment of Post SARS CoV 2 Fatigue among Physicians Working in COVID Designated Hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh","BackgroundFatigue has been observed after a number of infectious disease outbreaks around the world. After the outbreak of SARS CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in 2019, the disease turned into a pandemic very rapidly. Mental health is a key issue associated with such outbreaks. To explore the fatigue level among physicians working in designated public and private hospitals in Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case-control study of post-SARS-CoV-2 fatigue.

MethodIn this study 105 physicians who were diagnosed as COVID-19 infected, got treatment, and declared cured at least 6 weeks before the interview date, were recruited as cases and the same number of age and designation matched healthy physicians as control who are working in the same hospital. Case and control were selected in 1:1 ratio from each of the hospitals. The study population was selected by inclusion and exclusion criteria after taking informed written consent. Data collection was done by a semi-structured questionnaire. Diagnosis of COVID--19 infection was done by detection of SARS CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR from reference laboratories in Bangladesh or by HRCT Chest.

ResultAround two-thirds of the physicians were male (67.6% versus 32.4%). Most of them aged less than forty years (80.5%). The cases had a greater number of comorbid conditions than those who were negative. The FSS score (mean) was much higher for cases (36.7 {+/-} 5.3 versus 19.3 {+/-} 3.8) than the control group with a statistically significant difference with no significant gender differentiation. Similarly, around 67.7% of the previously COVID positive physicians represented in the highest FSS score tertile compared to the respondents in the control group had a mean score of less than 3. The difference was also highly significant.

ObjectivesTo estimate the associations between daily residential mobility index (RMI), air pollution, and meteorology, and daily cases and deaths for COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

MethodsWe applied a semiparametric generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate: 1) the association between residential mobility index and cases and deaths due to COVID-19, accounting for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), relative humidity, temperature and delayed exposure between 3-21 days and 2) the association between exposure to for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), accounting for relative humidity, temperature and mobility.

ResultsWe found an RMI of 45.28% results in 1,212 cases (95% CI: 1,189 to 1,235) and 44 deaths (95% CI: 40 to 47). Reducing mobility 5% would avoid 438 cases and 21 deaths. Also, we found that an increment of 10 g{middle dot}m-3 of PM2.5 risk of 1.140 (95% CI: 1.021 to 1.274) for cases and of 1.086 (95% CI: 1.008 to 1.170) for deaths, while O3 produces a relative risk of 1.075 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.150) for cases and 1.063 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.124) for deaths, respectively.

DiscussionWe compared our results with observations and literature review, finding well agreement. These results implicate that authorities and policymakers can use such mobility indices as tools to support social distance activities and assess their effectiveness in the coming weeks and months. Small increments of air pollution pose a risk of COVID-19 cases.

ConclusionSpatial distancing is a determinant factor to control cases and deaths for COVID-19. Small increments of air pollution result in a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

To better understand temporal evolution of COVID-19 related serological and other immune responses during a pandemic, we designed and implemented a baseline cross-sectional study of asymptomatic community volunteers and first responders in metro-Atlanta before the predicted infection peak in 2020. Methods: We recruited healthy community volunteers and first responders for health history, serology, and biobanking. Through an iterative process, we identified one location on our campus and one community location which were accessible, vacant, distant from COVID-19 testing sites, open for social distancing, private for informed consent, and operational for sanitation and ventilation. Research and cleaning supplies were obtained from other researchers and private online vendors due to shortages, and faculty directly participated in consenting and phlebotomy. Results: A total of 369 participants completed the study visits over six full and three half days. Over half of Phase 1 (174/299, 58.2%) and Phase 2 (45/70, 64.3%) self-reported as healthcare workers, and there was a high percentage of participants reporting exposure to known COVID-19 cases (48.2% and 61.4%).

289,Large-scale silane bead-based SARS-CoV-2 testing of a nursing home in Spain identifies a viral reservoir during lockdown period,"Background: Spain is one of the countries most heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As in other countries such as UK and USA, nursing homes have been an important human reservoir for the virus and the population with the highest mortality worldwide. The presence of asymptomatic carriers within nursing homes is one of the factors that could provoke new outbreaks during the relaxing of lockdown measures. Methods: We developed a high-throughput protocol for RNA extraction of patient samples based on silane magnetic beads in multi-well plates. The sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility rates were assessed using positive and negative clinical samples from the Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Spain. We utilized the protocol to test a pilot cohort of 138 residents and 87 staff from a nursing home in Northern Navarre, Spain. Findings: Our protocol showed high sensitivity (100%), specificity (96.0%) and linear correlation with PCR cycle threshold values obtained with a standard testing kit (R2 = 0.807, p=3E-05). Testing of 225 individuals from the nursing home revealed 63 residents (46%) and 14 staff (16%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 18 of the positive residents (28.6%) were symptomatic at time of testing. During follow-up, six PCR-negative symptomatic residents were retested and resulted positive. One-month mortality among positive residents was higher than in negative residents (15.9% vs 1.3%), regardless of age or comorbidities. Interpretation: Rapid silane bead-based RNA extraction expanded the testing capabilities and COVID-19 patients were promptly identified.

However, less is known about the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including lockdowns, on circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages and variants of concern, the relative contribution of travel to re-emergence of pandemic waves within communities or how different lineages and variants contribute to disease severity. Methods: We have conducted an analysis within a prospective, multicentre observational study of individuals attending four hospitals in the South-East of Ireland with COVID-19. Samples underwent WGS from which lineages and variants were assigned, lineage frequency was plotted over time and phylogenetic analysis was employed to determine the origin of variants detected post-lockdown. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed relationships between viral lineage/variant and COVID-19 disease severity. Results: We analysed 225 genome sequences across two SARS-CoV-2 waves, 134 (59.6%) from wave 1 (March to June) and 91 (40.4%) from wave 2 (July to December), representing 15.2% of COVID-19 admissions to these hospitals during the sampling periods. Four variants (B.1.1.162, B1.1.70, B.1.1.267 and B.1.1) comprised 68% of variants detected during wave 1. Of these variants, only a single B.1.1.70 sequence was detected in wave 2, while the B.1.177 lineage emerged and contributed to 82.3% of lineages detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggested multiple introductions of wave 2 variants from outside Ireland. We found no consistent association between SARS-CoV-2 lineages and disease severity. Conclusions: These data suggest elimination of common SARS-CoV-2 lineages from hospitalised cases associated with effective NPIs and that importation of new viral variants through travel was a significant contributor to the re-emergence of the pandemic in the second wave in Ireland. Our findings highlight the importance of genomic surveillance in identifying circulating viral genetic diversity and variants of concern and, also, modelling the disease burden of SARS-CoV-2.",Patrick W.G.

292,Estimating the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections reported through diagnostic testing,"The number of positive diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 is a critical metric that is commonly used to assess epidemic severity and the efficacy of current levels of control. However, a proportion of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may never receive a diagnostic test, while many of those who are tested may receive a false negative result. Consequently, cases reported through testing of symptomatic individuals represent only a fraction of the total number of infections, and this proportion is expected to vary depending on changes in natural factors and variability in test-seeking behaviour. Here we combine a number of data sources from England to estimate the proportion of infections that have resulted in a positive diagnosis. Using published estimates of the incubation period distribution and time-dependent test sensitivity, we estimate SARS-CoV-2 incidence from daily reported diagnostic test data. By calibrating this estimate against surveillance data we find that approximately 25\% of infections were consistently reported through diagnostic testing before November 2020. This percentage increased through the final months of 2020, predominantly in regions with a large presence of the the UK variant of concern (VOC), before falling rapidly in the last two weeks of January 2021. These changes are not explained by variation in rates of lateral flow device or PCR testing, but are consistent with there being an increased probability for the VOC that infection will result in an eventual positive diagnosis.",Ewan Colman; Jessica Enright; Gavrila Amadea Puspitarani; Rowland Raymond Kao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251411,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.21251411,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,True
293,"Susceptibility and risk of suffering SARS-COV-2 infection by demographic characteristics and pre-existing medical conditions among middle-aged and older adults in Tarragona, Spain: results from the COVID19 TARRACO Cohort Study, March-June 2020","Objective: To analyse susceptibility/risk of suffering COVID19 among adults with distinct underlying medical conditions. Methods: Cohort study (population-based) including 79,083 people >=50 years-old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). At study start (01/03/2020) baseline cohort characteristics (demographic, previous comorbidities, chronic medications and vaccinations history) were recorded. Primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed COVID19 incurred in cohort members throughout 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Risk of suffering COVID19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age/sex and previous comorbidities. Results: Across study period, 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID19 cases were observed (mean incidence: 39.5 cases per 100,000 persons-week). In multivariable-analysis, age/years (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02; p=0.050), nursing-home (HR: 20.19; 95% CI: 15.98-25.51; p<0.001), neurological disease (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.03-1.77; p=0.029), taking diuretics (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10-1.75; p=0.006), antiplatelet (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05-1.76; p=0.021) and benzodiazepines (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00-1.53; p=0.047) significantly increased risk; while smoking (HR: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.41-0.80; p=0.001), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61-1.00; p=0.048), angiotensin II receptor blockers (HR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.51-0.96; p=0.027) and statins (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58-0.96; p=0.025) were associated with reduced risk. Among non-institutionalised persons, cancer, renal and cardiac disease appeared also related to increased risk, whereas influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk. Conclusion: In a setting with relatively low incidence of COVID19 across the first wave of pandemic period, age, nursing-home residence and multiple comorbidities appear predisposing for COVID19 among middle-aged/older adults. Conversely, statins, angiotensin-receptor blockers/inhibitors and influenza vaccination were related with decreased risk.

294,Naive human B cells can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 through recognition of its receptor binding domain,"Exposure to a pathogen elicits an adaptive immune response aimed to control and eradicate. This initial exposure is imprinted on the immune system, so that a subsequent encounter to the same pathogen or a variant will result in a memory recall response that is often protective. Interrogating the naive B cell repertoire in terms of both abundance and specificity to said pathogen may contribute to an understanding of how to potentially elicit protective responses. Here, we isolated naive B cells across 8 human donors, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Single B cell sorting, and subsequent sequence analysis, showed diverse gene usage and pairing with no apparent restriction on complementarity determining region length in either the heavy or light chains. We show that recombinantly expressed IgGs and Fabs of these germline precursors bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Importantly, a subset of these naive antibodies also bind SARS-CoV, an emergent variant (501Y.V2) and a potential pandemic (WIV-1) coronavirus. Furthermore, naive antibodies can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in the absence of any somatic hypermutation, suggesting that protective immunity to coronaviruses, more broadly, may be genetically encoded. Future studies aimed at understanding the naive repertoire to other coronaviruses may ultimately reveal shared specificities that could be leveraged to develop pan-coronavirus vaccines aimed at priming encoded germline responses.",Jared Feldman; Julia Bals; Kerri St. Denis; Evan C.

Herein we describe an ACE2-lentivirus system and illustrate its utility for in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection models. Transduction of non-permissive cell lines with hACE2 imparted replication competence, and transduction with mACE2 containing N30D, N31K, F83Y and H353K substitutions, to match hACE2, rescued SARS-CoV-2 replication. hACE2-lentivirus transduction of C57BL/6J, IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice lungs illustrated that removing type I or III interferon responses had no significant effect on virus replication. However, RNA-Seq analyses illustrated they were required for the inflammatory responses, which were similar to those seen in COVID-19 patients. We also illustrate the utility of hACE2 transduction for vaccine evaluation in C57BL/6J mice. In summary, we establish a hACE2-lentivirus mouse model which has broad application in SARS-CoV-2 research, while also offering the inherent advantages of lentiviral transduction such as stable genomic integration.",Daniel J Rawle; Thuy T Le; Troy Dumenil; Kexin Yan; Bing Tang; Cameron Bishop; Andreas Suhrbier,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430547,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430547,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,,False
296,In vitro evolution of Remdesivir resistance reveals genome plasticity of SARS-CoV-2,"Remdesivir (RDV) is used widely for COVID-19 patients despite varying results in recent clinical trials. Here, we show how serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in the presence of RDV selected for drug-resistant viral populations. We determined that the E802D mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was sufficient to confer decreased RDV sensitivity without affecting viral fitness. Analysis of more than 200,000 sequences of globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants show no evidence of widespread transmission of RDV-resistant mutants. Surprisingly, we also observed changes in the Spike (i.e., H69 E484, N501, H655) corresponding to mutations identified in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants indicating that they can arise in vitro in the absence of immune selection. This study illustrates SARS-CoV-2 genome plasticity and offers new perspectives on surveillance of viral variants.

297,Bifurcated monocyte states are predictive of mortality in severe COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with varied clinical manifestations1, ranging from mild symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high mortality2,3. Despite extensive analyses, there remains an urgent need to delineate immune cell states that contribute to mortality in severe COVID-19. We performed high-dimensional cellular and molecular profiling of blood and respiratory samples from critically ill COVID-19 patients to define immune cell genomic states that are predictive of outcome in severe COVID-19 disease. Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) manifested increased frequencies of inflammatory monocytes and plasmablasts that were also associated with ARDS not due to COVID-19. Single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq)-based deconvolution of genomic states of peripheral immune cells revealed distinct gene modules that were associated with COVID-19 outcome. Notably, monocytes exhibited bifurcated genomic states, with expression of a cytokine gene module exemplified by CCL4 (MIP-1{beta}) associated with survival and an interferon signaling module associated with death. These gene modules were correlated with higher levels of MIP-1{beta} and CXCL10 levels in plasma, respectively. Monocytes expressing genes reflective of these divergent modules were also detectable in endotracheal aspirates. Machine learning algorithms identified the distinctive monocyte modules as part of a multivariate peripheral immune system state that was predictive of COVID-19 mortality. Follow-up analysis of the monocyte modules on ICU day 5 was consistent with bifurcated states that correlated with distinct inflammatory cytokines. Our data suggests a pivotal role for monocytes and their specific inflammatory genomic states in contributing to mortality in life-threatening COVID-19 disease and may facilitate discovery of new diagnostics and therapeutics.",Anthony R Cillo; Ashwin Somasundaram; Feng Shan; Carly Cardello; Creg J Workman; Georgios D Kitsios; Ayana Ruffin; Sheryl Kunning; Caleb Lampenfeld; Sayali Onkar; Stephanie Grebinowski; Gaurav Deshmukh; Barbara Methe; Chang Liu; Sham Nambulli; Lawrence Andrews; W.

Vaccines approved for use and those in development intend to use neutralizing antibodies to block viral sites binding to the hosts cellular receptors. Virus infection is mediated by the spike glycoprotein trimer on the virion surface via its receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibody response to this domain is an important outcome of the immunization and correlates well with viral neutralization. Here we show that macromolecular constructs with recombinant RBD conjugated to tetanus toxoid induce a potent immune response in laboratory animals. Some advantages of the immunization with the viral antigen coupled to tetanus toxoid have become evident such as predominant IgG immune response due to affinity maturation and long-term specific B-memory cells.

299,A novel antibody against the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: effects on proteolytic cleavage and ACE2 binding,"SARS-CoV-2 harbors a unique S1/S2 furin cleavage site within its spike protein, which can be cleaved by furin and other proprotein convertases. Proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the S1/S2 boundary facilitates interaction with host ACE2 receptor for cell entry. To address this, high titer antibody was generated against the SARS-CoV-2-specific furin motif. Using a series of innovative ELISA-based assays, this furin site blocking antibody displayed high sensitivity and specificity for the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, and demonstrated effective blockage of both enzyme-mediated cleavage and spike-ACE2 interaction. The results suggest that immunological blocking of the furin cleavage site may afford a suitable approach to stem proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and curtail viral infectivity.",Michael G Spelios; Jeanne M Capanelli; Adam W Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430451,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430451,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False

Even with the unprecedented speed at which vaccines were developed and introduced into society, identifying therapeutic interventions and drug targets for patients infected with the virus remains important as new strains of the virus may evolve, or future coronaviruses may emerge, that are resistant to current vaccines. The application of transcriptomic RNA sequencing of infected samples may shed new light on the pathways involved in viral mechanisms and host responses. We describe the application of ""dual RNA-seq"" analysis to consider both the host and pathogen transcriptomes simultaneously, to investigate for the first time the co-regulation of human and SARS-CoV-2 genes. Together with differential expression analysis, we describe the tissue specificity of SARS-CoV-2 expression, an inferred lipopolysaccharide response, and co-regulation of CXCLs, SPRRs, S100s with SARS-CoV-2 expression. Lipopolysaccharide response pathways in particular offer promise for future therapeutic research and the prospect of subgrouping patients based on chemokine expression that may help explain the vastly different reactions patients have to infection.

301,Exosomes from COVID-19 patients carry tenascin-C and fibrinogen-β in triggering inflammatory signals in distant organ cells,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cytokine storm and overshoot immunity in humans; however, it remains to be determined whether genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 and/or virus induced soluble mediators from lung epithelial cells as natural host are carried out by macrophages or other vehicles at distant organs causing tissue damage. We speculated that exosomes as extracellular vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-{beta} (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-{kappa}B pathway, we examined the status of TNF-, IL-6 and CCL5 expression upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients.

ImportanceExosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins. Little is known about exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and their role in pathogenesis. Here, we have carefully examined and analyzed this aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Disruption in our ability to detect odors, or anosmia, has emerged as a hallmark symptom of infection with SARS-CoV-2, yet the mechanism behind this abrupt sensory deficit remains elusive. Here, using molecular evaluation of human olfactory epithelium (OE) from subjects succumbing to COVID-19 and a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we discovered widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) as well as key components of their signaling pathway. OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters. Our experiments uncover a novel molecular mechanism by which a virus with a very selective tropism can elicit persistent transcriptional changes in cells that evade it, contributing to the severity of COVID-19.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430314,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430314,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False

In the Syrian hamster model, we show that intranasal administration of IFN- starting one day pre-infection or one day post-infection limited weight loss and decreased viral lung titers. By contrast, intranasal administration of IFN- starting at the onset of symptoms three days post-infection had no impact on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Pericytes are perivascular cells within the brain that are proposed as SARS-CoV-2 infection points1. Here we show that pericyte-like cells (PLCs), when integrated into a cortical organoid, are capable of infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Prior to infection, PLCs elicited astrocytic maturation and production of basement membrane components, features attributed to pericyte functions in vivo. While traditional cortical organoids showed little evidence of infection, PLCs within cortical organoids served as viral  replication hubs, with virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I interferon transcriptional responses.

Vaccine candidates have demonstrated robust humoral responses and have protected against infection. However, efficacy trials were focused on individuals with no prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and, as a result, little is known about immune responses induced by these mRNA vaccines in individuals who recovered from COVID-19. Here, we evaluated immune responses in 32 subjects who received two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. In individuals naive to SARS-CoV-2, we observed robust increases in humoral and antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses following each dose of vaccine, whereas individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated strong humoral and antigen-specific ASC responses to the first dose but muted responses to the second dose of the vaccine for the time points studied. These data highlight an important gap in our knowledge and may have major implications for how these vaccines should be used to prevent COVID-19.

Many guidelines recommend using aerosol precautions during ""aerosol generating procedures"" (AGPs) and droplet (>5 m) precautions at other times. However, there is emerging evidence that respiratory activities such as cough and not AGPs are the important source of aerosols. Methods We used a novel chamber with an optical particle counter sampling at 100 L/min to count and size-fractionate all exhaled particles (0.5-25 m). We compared emissions from ten healthy subjects during respiratory ""activities"" (quiet breathing, talking, shouting, forced expiratory maneuvers, exercise and coughing) with respiratory ""therapies"" designated as AGPs: high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D, respectively.

During quiet breathing, HFNO at 60 L/min increased counts 2.3-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.4) (p=0.03) and NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D at 25/10 cm H2O increased counts by 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.7 to 4.1) and 7.8-fold (95% CI, 4.4 to 13.6) respectively (p<0.001). During activities, respiratory therapies and facemasks reduced emissions compared to activities alone. Conclusion Talking, exertional breathing and coughing generate substantially more aerosols than the respiratory therapies HFNO and NIPPV which can reduce total emissions.

307,How to decide which COVID-19 patient with myocardial infarction to send to the Cath Lab? - A case series of COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction,"INTRODUCTIONThe Coronavirus pandemic has hit the world with its vast contagiousness, high morbidity, and mortality. Apart from the direct damage to the lung tissue, the corona virus infection is able to predispose patients to thrombotic disease, thus causing cerebral or coronary incidents.

AIMSThe aim of this study was to find a clinical or laboratory parameter, that would help in distinguishing between COVID-19 patients with myocardial infarction (MI), who have an infarct-related artery (IRA) and therefore, require immediate revascularization, and those, who have no IRA.

METHODSThis was a single-center, observational study of 10 consecutive patients with COVID-19, who were admitted with confirmed MI.

RESULTSIn our study group the mean age was 67.5 {+/-} 8.3 years, half of the patients were female; all of them had arterial hypertension; 8 patients (80%) had dyslipidemy; 4 (40%) had diabetes. 30% of the patients with MI did not have an IRA, and did not require pPCI. Patients with MI and IRA had significantly higher hsTrI values (48.9 {+/-} 43.2 vs 0.6 {+/-} 0.7, p=0.007) and exclusively typical chest pain 100% vs 0%, p=0.007), compared to patients with MI without an IRA. The ECG changes had only marginal statistical significance. Our results suggest that using a higher cut-off value for hsTrI (>7.5 times upper reference range) increases the specificity and positive predictive value for diagnosing a MI with the presence of IRA and need for pPCI, to 100%

CONCLUSIONIn our analysis we confirm that a higher cut-off value for hsTrI helps distinguish between COVID patients with MI, who have IRA and therefore, require immediate revascularization, compared to those, who have no IRA.",Iana Simova; Denis Nikolov; Nikolay Dimitrov; Vladimir Kornovski; Vesela Tomova; Toni Vekov; Yordan Krasnaliev,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251081,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251081,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
308,Multivariate spatio-temporal analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic,"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant mortality and disruption on a global scale not seen in living memory. Understanding the spatial and temporal vectors of transmission as well as similarities in the trajectories of recorded cases and deaths across countries can aid in understanding the benefit or otherwise of varying interventions and control strategies on virus transmission. It can also highlight emerging globa trends as they occur. Data on number of cases and deaths across the globe have been made available through a variety of databases and provide a wide range of opportunities for the application of multivariate statistical methods to extract information on similarity or difference from them. Here we conduct spatial and temporal multivariate statistical analyses of global Covid-19 cases and deaths for the period spanning January to August 2020, using a variety of distance based multivariate methods to cluster countries according to similar temporal trends in cases and deaths resulting from COVID-19. We also use novel air passenger data as a proxy for movement between countries. The air passenger movement can act as an important vector of transmission and thus scaling covariance matrices before conducting dimension reduction techniques can account for known structures in the data and help highlight important residual spatial and/or temporal trends that may then be attributable to the success of interventions or other cultural differences. Global temporal structure is found to be of significantly more importance than local spatial structure in terms of global dynamics. Our results highlight a significant global change in case and mortality daynamics from early-August, consistent in timing with the emergence of new strains with highger levels of transmission. We propose the methodology offers great potential in real-time analysis of complex, noisy spatio-temporal data and the extraction of emerging changes in pandemic dynamics that can support policy and decision makers.",Wen Xiang; Ben Swallow,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251339,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251339,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
309,Rapid Impact Analysis of B 1.1.7 Variant on the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in North Carolina,"BackgroundSeveral cases of the B1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were identified in North Carolina first on January 23, 2021 in Mecklenburg County and later in Guilford County on January 28, 2021.[1,2] This variant has been associated with higher levels of transmissibility.[3-6] This study examines the potential impact of increased transmissibility as the B1.1.7 variant becomes more predominant given current vaccine distribution plans and existing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).

MethodWe explored the anticipated impact on the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and Guilford County given the date of import of B1.1.7. The approximate growth rate in proportion of B1.1.7 observed in the United Kingdom was fit and used to establish the estimate share of B1.1.7 circulating in North Carolina. Using the nowcasted reproduction numbers, a stochastic discrete compartmental model was fit with the current vaccination rates and B1.1.7 transmissibility to estimate the impact on the effective reproduction number.

ResultsWe found that the effective reproduction number for North Carolina and Guilford County may exceed one, indicating a return to accelerating spread of infection in April as the proportion of B1.1.7 increases. The effective reproduction number will likely decrease into March, then increase as the proportion of B1.1.7 increases in circulation in the population.

ConclusionsExisting non-pharmaceutical interventions will need to remain in effect through the spring. Given the current vaccination rate and these interventions, it is likely that there will be an increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The impact of the variant will likely be heterogeneous across North Carolina given the reproduction number and volume of susceptible persons in each county at the time of introduction of the variant. Age-based vaccinations will likely reduce the overall impact on hospitalizations. This analysis underlines the need for population level genetic surveillance to confirm the proportion of variants circulating.",Michael E DeWitt Jr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251291,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251291,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
310,L18F substrain of SARS-CoV-2 VOC-202012/01 is rapidly spreading in England,"The Variant of Concern (VOC)-202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7) is a rapidly growing lineage of SARS-CoV-2. In January 2021, VOC-202012/01 constituted about 80% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in England and was present in 27 out of 29 countries that reported at least 50 viral genomes. As this strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. Based on GISAID data we systematically estimated growth rates of mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that L18F substitution in viral spike protein has initiated a substrain characterized by replicative advantage of 1.70 [95% CI: 1.56-1.96] in relation to the remaining VOC-202012/01 substrains. The L18F mutation is of significance because when recently analyzed in the context of the South African strain 501Y.V2 it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. We additionally indicate three mutations that were acquired by VOC-202012/01 in the receptor binding motif of spike, specifically E484K, F490S, and S494P, that may also give rise to escape mutants. Such mutants may hinder efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence.",Frederic Grabowski; Marek Kochanczyk; Tomasz Lipniacki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251262,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251262,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True

However, no data are available for the pediatric population. For this reason, we performed this study aiming to understand if sex influenced disease severity and outcomes in a large cohort of latin-american children with COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). We found that a higher percentage of male children developed MIS-C (8.9% vs 5% in females) and died (1.2% and 0.4% in females), although on multivariate adjusted analyses the only statistically significant difference was found in need of hospitalization, with females less frequently admitted compared with boys (25.6% vs 35.4%).

312,Impact on Mental Health of students due to restriction caused by COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional study,"BackgroundThe aim of the study was to investigate fear, depression and anxiety symptoms among students of India due to COVID-19 pandemic and its restriction.

MethodThe cross-sectional web-based research was conducted between mid-November and mid-December 2020 with the objective of understanding the psychological and behavioral consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic effect on students due to the constraint of forced control. The questionnaire included a) socio-demographic questions and b) psychometric scales evaluating the psychological and behavioral impact caused by COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions.

ResultsTotal number of 324 students participated in this study in which 44.4% were male and 55.6% were female. Fear of COVID-19 scale showed 68.8% of students had high fear, 24.4% had moderate to severe depression and 51.5% had moderate to severe anxiety. The correlation of fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19s) with Generalized Anxiety scale (GAD-7) and brief patient health questionnaire scale (PHQ-9) was found to be 0.492 and 0.474 respectively.

ConclusionThis research concludes that there is a very strong fear of COVID-19 among students, along with anxiety and depression symptoms.

313,An integrated rural health system baseline assessment of COVID-19 preparedness in Siaya Kenya,"ObjectiveOur aim was to assess Siaya county COVID-19 preparedness at community and health facility levels and measure baseline household prevalences of fever and cough.

DesignThere was retrospective and prospective data collection using standard tools. We determined the prevalence of fever and cough in households. We evaluated household knowledge about COVID-19 prevention and adherence to preventive measures. We evaluated the presence of a workforce, essential infrastructure and equipment needed for COVID-19 case management, and the availability of essential maternal and child health services in health facilities.

SettingSiaya in rural Western Kenya

Participantshouseholds and health facilities in Siaya

ResultsWe visited 19474 households and assessed 152 facilities. The prevalences of fever and cough ranged from 1.4% to 4.3% and 0.2 to 0.8% respectively; 97% and 98% of households had not received a guest from nor travelled outside Siaya respectively; 97% knew about frequent handwashing, 66% knew about keeping distance, and 80% knew about wearing a mask; 63% washed their hands countless times; 53% remained home; and 74% used a mask when out in public. The health facility assessment showed: 93.6% were dispensaries and health centers; 90.4% had nurses; 40.5% had oxygen capacity; 13.5% had pulse oximeters; and 2 ventilators were available; 94.2% of facilities did not have COVID-19 testing kits; 94% and 91% of facilities continued to provide antenatal care and immunization services respectively. Health care worker training in COVID-19 had been planned.

ConclusionsHousehold prevalence of fever and cough was low suggesting Siaya had not entered the active community transmission phase in June 2020. Our assessment revealed a need for training in COVID-19 case management, and a need for basic equipment and supplies including pulse oximeters and oxygen. Future interventions should address these gaps.

314,Galectin-3 as a potential prognostic biomarker of severe COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,"BACKGROUNDPrognostic biomarkers are needed to identify patients at high-risk for severe COVID-19. Galectin-3 is known to drive neutrophil infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributing to airway inflammation.

METHODSIn this prospective cohort, we assessed galectin-3 levels in 156 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were diagnosed as either critical (>50% lung damage) or moderate (<50% of lung damage) based on computerized tomography. Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or died during hospitalization were categorized as having a severe outcome, and a non-severe outcome if they were discharged and none of the former occurred.

RESULTSElevated serum galectin-3 was significantly higher in critical patients compared to moderate ones (35.91 {+/-} 19.37 ng/mL vs. 25 {+/-} 14.85 ng/mL, p<0.0001). Patients who progressed to a severe outcome including IMV and/or in-hospital death, presented higher galectin-3 levels (41.17 ng/mL [IQR 29.71 - 52.25] vs. 23.76 ng/mL [IQR 15.78 - 33.97] compared to those of a non-severe outcome, p<0.0001). Galectin-3 discriminated well between those with severe and non-severe outcome, with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 - 0.84, p<0.0001) and was found to be an independent predictor of severe outcome regardless of the percentage of lung involvement. Additionally, the combination of galectin-3, CRP and albumin, significantly improved its individual predicting ability with an AUC 0.84 (95% CI 0.77 - 0.91, p<0.0001).

CONCLUSIONCirculating galectin-3 levels can be used to predict severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including the requirement of mechanical ventilation and/or death, regardless of the initial severity of the disease.",Eduardo Cervantes-Alvarez; Nathaly Limon-de la Rosa; Moises Salgado-de la Mora; Paola Valdez-Sandoval; Mildred Palacios-Jimenez; Fatima Rodriguez-Alvarez; Brenda I.

315,The protective association between statins use and adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionStatins may reduce a cytokine storm, which has been hypothesized as a possible mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report on adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin usage.

MethodsLiteratures were searched from January 2019 to December 2020 to identify studies that reported the association between statin usage and adverse outcomes, including mortality, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately.

ResultsThirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.03). Patients who were administered statins after their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.61; OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.75). The use of statins did not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.64). Among non-ICU patients, statin users were at a lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.62; OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.88).

Moreover, the use of these designs is wide spreading and nowadays they are used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples to act as epidemiological surveillance tool. However, at the time of designing the published RT-qPCR assays, a lack of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available may explain a low exclusivity in some cases.

317,Development and Validation of a Simplified Risk Score for the Prediction of Critical COVID-19 Illness in Newly Diagnosed Patients,"Scores for identifying patients at high risk of progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are discussed as key instruments for clinical decision-making and patient management during the current pandemic.

Here we used the patient data from the multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 - Infected Patients (LEOSS) and applied a technique of variable selection in order to develop a simplified score to identify patients at increased risk of critical illness or death.

A total of 1,946 patients, who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the initial analysis. They were split into a derivation and a validation cohort (n=1,297 and 649, respectively). A stability selection among a total of 105 baseline predictors for the combined endpoint of progression to critical phase or COVID-19-related death allowed us to develop a simplified score consisting of five predictors: CRP, Age, clinical disease phase (uncomplicated vs. complicated), serum urea and D-dimer (abbreviated as CAPS-D score). This score showed an AUC of 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) in the validation cohort for predicting the combined endpoint within 7 days of diagnosis and 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) during the full follow-up. Finally, we used an additional prospective cohort of 682 patients, who were diagnosed largely after the ""first wave"" of the pandemic to validate predictive accuracy of the score, observing similar results (AUC for an event within 7 days: 0.83, CI95%, 0.78-0.87; for full follow-up: 0.82, CI95%, 0.78-0.86).

We thus successfully establish and validate an easily applicable score to calculate the risk of disease progression of COVID-19 to critical illness or death.",Stanislas Werfel; Carolin E. M.

318,"COVID-19 infection and outcomes in a population-based cohort of 17,173 adults with intellectual disabilities compared with the general population","ObjectivesTo compare COVID-19 infection, severe infection, mortality, case-fatality, and excess deaths, among adults with intellectual disabilities and those without.

DesignRecord-linkage of all adults recorded with intellectual disabilities in Scotlands Census, 2011, and a 5% sample of other adults, to COVID-19 test results (Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland), hospitalisations (Scottish Morbidity Record 01), and deaths (National Records of Scotland).

SettingGeneral population; 24th January 2020 - 15th August 2020

ParticipantsSuccessful linkage of 94.8% provided data on 17,173 adults with, and 195,859 without, intellectual disabilities.

OutcomesCrude rates of COVID-19 infection, severe infection (hospitalisation/death), mortality, and case fatality; age-, sex- and deprivation-standardised severe infection and mortality ratios; annual all-cause mortality for 2020 and 2015-2019.

ResultsAdults with intellectual disabilities had higher rates of COVID-19 infection (957/100,000 versus 513/100,000); severe infection (549/100,000 versus 237/100,000); mortality (259/100,000 versus 114/100,000); and case-fatality (30% versus 24%). Poorer COVID-19 outcomes remained after standardising for age, sex and deprivation: standardised severe infection ratio 2.59 (95% CI 1.80, 3.39) and mortality ratio 3.20 (95% CI 2.16, 4.25). These were higher among 55-64 year olds: 7.12 (95% CI 3.73, 10.50) and 16.16 (95% CI7.69, 24.63) respectively. Among adults with intellectual disabilities, all-cause mortality was only slightly higher in 2020 than the previous five years: standardised mortality ratios 2.49 (95% CI 2.17, 2.81) and 2.38 (95% CI 2.26, 2.49) respectively.

ConclusionsAdults with intellectual disabilities were more likely to be infected with COVID-19, and had worse outcomes once infected, particularly those under 65 years. Non-pharmaceutical interventions directed at formal and informal carers are essential to reduce transmission and all adults with intellectual disabilities should be immediately prioritised for vaccination regardless of age.

319,Modelling the impact of reopening schools in early 2021 in the presence of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant and with roll-out of vaccination against COVID-19,"BackgroundFollowing the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK in late 2020 and the emergence of the new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, B.1.1.7, a third national lockdown was imposed from January 5, 2021. Following the decline of COVID-19 cases over the remainder of January 2021, it is important to assess the conditions under which reopening schools from early March is likely to lead to resurgence of the epidemic. This study models the impact of a partial national lockdown with social distancing measures enacted in communities and workplaces under different strategies of reopening schools from March 8, 2021 and compares it to the impact of continual full national lockdown remaining until April 19, 2021.

MethodsWe used our previously published model, Covasim, to model the emergence of B.1.1.7 over September 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We extended the model to incorporate the impacts of the roll-out of a two-dose vaccine against COVID-19, assuming 200,000 daily doses of the vaccine in people 75 years or older with vaccination that offers 95% reduction in disease acquisition and 10% reduction of transmission blocking. We used the model, calibrated until January 25, 2021, to simulate the impact of a full national lockdown (FNL) with schools closed until April 19, 2021 versus four different partial national lockdown (PNL) scenarios with different elements of schooling open: 1) staggered PNL with primary schools and exam-entry years (years 11 and 13) returning on March 8, 2021 and the rest of the schools years on March 15, 2020; 2) full-return PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021; 3) primary-only PNL with primary schools and exam critical years (Y11 and Y13) going back only on March 8, 2021 with the rest of the secondary schools back on April 19, 2021 and 4) part-Rota PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021 with primary schools remaining open continuously but secondary schools on a two-weekly rota-system with years alternating between a fortnight of face-to-face and remote learning until April 19, 2021. Across all scenarios, we projected the number of new daily cases, cumulative deaths and effective reproduction number R until April 30, 2020.

ResultsOur calibration across different scenarios is consistent with the new variant B.1.1.7 being around 60% more transmissible. Strict social distancing measures, i.e. national lockdowns, are required to contain the spread of the virus and control the hospitalisations and deaths during January and February 2021. The national lockdown will reduce the number of cases by early March levels similar to those seen in October with R also falling and remaining below 1 during the lockdown. Infections start to increase when schools open but if other parts of society remain closed this resurgence is not sufficient to bring R above 1. Reopening primary schools and exam critical years only or having primary schools open continuously with secondary schools on rotas will lead to lower increases in cases and R than if all schools open. Under the current vaccination assumptions and across the set of scenarios considered, R would increase above 1 if society reopens simultaneously, simulated here from April 19, 2021.

FindingsOur findings suggest that stringent measures are necessary to mitigate the increase in cases and bring R below 1 over January and February 2021. It is plausible that a PNL with schools partially open from March 8, 2021 and the rest of the society remaining closed until April 19, 2021 may keep R below 1, with some increase evident in infections compared to continual FNL until April 19, 2021. Reopening society in mid-April, with the vaccination strategy we model, could push R above 1 and induce a surge in infections, but the effect of vaccination may be able to control this in future depending on the transmission blocking properties of the vaccines.",Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths; Robyn Margaret Stuart; Cliff Kerr; Katherine Rosenfeld; Dina Mistry; William Waites; Daniel J Klein; Chris Bonell; Russell M Viner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251287,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21251287,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
320,High School Sports During the CoVID-19 Pandemic: The Impact of Sport Participation on the Health of Adolescents,"ContextDuring the fall of 2020, some high schools across the US allowed their students to participate in interscholastic sports while others cancelled or postponed their sport programs due to concerns regarding CoVID19 transmission. It is unknown what effect this has had on the physical and mental health of student athletes.

ObjectiveIdentify the impact of playing a sport during the CoVID19 pandemic on the health of student athletes.

DesignCross-sectional study.

SettingSample recruited via email.

Patients or Other Participants559 Wisconsin high school athletes (age=15.7+1.2 yrs., female=44%) from 44 high schools completed an online survey in October 2020. A total of 171 (31%) athletes played (PLY) a fall sport, while 388 (69%) did not play (DNP).

Main Outcome Measure(s)Demographics included: sex, grade and sports played. Assessments included the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Univariable comparisons between the two groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means for each continuous outcome measure were compared between the groups by ANOVA models that controlled for Age, Sex, Teaching method (Virtual, Hybrid, or In-person), and the % of students eligible for free lunch.

RESULTSPLY group participants were less likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety (PLY=6.6%, DNP=44.1%, p<0.001) and depression (PLY=18.2%, DNP=40.4%, p<0.001). PLY athletes reported higher (better) PFABS scores (mean: [95%CI]), (PLY=23.2[22.0,24.5], DNP=16.4[15.0,17.8], p <0.001) and higher (better) PedsQL total scores (PLY=88.4[85.9,90.9], DNP=79.6[76.8,82.4], p <0.001).

CONCLUSIONSAdolescent athletes who played a sport during the CoVID19 pandemic reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as higher physical activity and quality of life scores compared to adolescent athletes who did not play a sport.

321,COVID-19 in pregnancy: characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women admitted to hospital because of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Nordic countries.,"IntroductionPopulation-based studies about the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) in pregnancy are few and have limited generalizability to the Nordic population and health care systems.

Material and methodThis study examines pregnant women with COVID-19 in the five Nordic countries. Pregnant women were included if they were admitted to hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020 and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test 14 days or fewer prior to the admission. Cause of admission was classified as obstetric or COVID-19 related.

ResultsIn the study areas, 214 pregnant women with a positive test were admitted to hospital, of which 56 women needed hospital care due to COVID-19. The rate of admission due to COVID-19 was 0.4 per 1000 deliveries in Denmark, Finland, and Norway and 3.8 per 1000 deliveries in the Swedish regions. Women hospitalized because of COVID-19 were more frequently obese (P < 0.001) and had migrant background (P < 0.001) compared to the total population of women who delivered in 2018. Twelve women (21.4%) needed intensive care. Preterm delivery (n=12, 25%, P < 0.001) and cesarean delivery (n=21, 43,8%, P < 0.001) were more frequent in women with COVID-19 compared to the women who delivered in 2018. No maternal deaths, stillbirths or neonatal deaths were reported.

ConclusionsThe risk of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy was low in the Nordic countries. A fifth of the women required intensive care and we observed higher rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries. National public health policies appear to have had an impact on the rates of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy. Nordic collaboration is important in collecting robust data and assessing rare outcomes.

Key MessageRisk of hospital admission due to COVID-19 infection among pregnant women was low in the Nordic countries, but varied between the countries, which is most likely related to different national public health strategies.",Hilde Engjom; Anna Aabakke; Kari Klungsoyr; Teresia Svanvik; Outi Ayras; Eva Jonasdottir; Lars Thurn; Karin Petterson; Elin Jones; Karin Kallen; Lill T Nyflot; Iqbal Al-Zirqi; Siri Vangen; Petur Juliusson; Mika Gissler; Lone Krebs,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250672,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250672,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
322,Patterns of COVID-19 pandemic dynamics following deployment of a broad national immunization program,"Studies on the real-life impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine, recently authorized for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are urgently needed. Here, we analysed the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization in Israel following a vaccination campaign initiated on December 20th, 2020. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data originating from the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) from March 2020 to February 2021. In order to distill the possible effect of the vaccinations from other factors, including a third lockdown imposed in Israel on January 2021, we compared the time-dependent changes in number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations between (1) individuals aged 60 years and older, eligible to receive the vaccine earlier and younger individuals (0-59 years old); (2) early-vaccinated cities compared to late-vaccinated cities; (3) early-vaccinated geographical statistical areas (GSAs) compared to late-vaccinated GSAs; and (4) the current lockdown versus the previous lockdown, imposed on September 2020. By February 6th 2021, 45.3% and 29.7% of the entire Israeli population (89.9% and 80% of individuals older than 60 years old) received the first dose or both doses of the vaccine, respectively, or recovered from COVID-19. In mid-January, the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalization started to decline, with a larger and earlier decrease among older individuals. This trend was more evident in early-vaccinated compared to late-vaccinated cities. Such a pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown. Our analysis demonstrates evidence for the real-life effectiveness of a national vaccination campaign in Israel on the pandemic dynamics. This report reflects a snapshot of a fast-changing situation. However, we believe our findings have major public health implications in the struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic, including the publics perception of the need for and benefit of nationwide vaccination campaigns. More studies aimed at assessing the effectiveness of vaccination both on the individual and on the population level, with larger followup are needed.",Hagai Rossman; Smadar Shilo; Tomer Meir; Malka Gorfine; Uri Shalit; Eran Segal,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251325,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251325,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,True
323,A potent bispecific nanobody protects hACE2 mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection via intranasal administration,"The dramatically expanding COVID-19 needs multiple effective countermeasures. Neutralizing antibodies are a potential therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. A number of neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) were reported for their in vitro activities. However, in vivo protection of these nanobodies was not reported in animal models. In the current report, we characterized several RBD-specific Nbs isolated from a screen of an Nb library derived from an alpaca immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S); among them, three Nbs exhibited picomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2 live virus, pseudotyped viruses, and 15 circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. To improve the efficacy, various configurations of Nbs were engineered. Nb15-NbH-Nb15, a novel trimer constituted of three Nbs, was constructed to be bispecific for human serum albumin (HSA) and RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited sub-ng/ml neutralization potency against the wild-type and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 with a long half-life in vivo. In addition, we showed that intranasal administration of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 provided 100% protection for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes against SARS-CoV-2 infection in transgenic hACE2 mice. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 is a potential candidate for both prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory administration.

One sentence summaryNb15-NbH-Nb15, with a novel heterotrimeric bispecific configuration, exhibited potent and broad neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and provided in vivo protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 transgenic mice via intranasal delivery.

324,High Throughput Nanopore Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Genomes from Patient Samples,"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China, causing a potentially lethal respiratory viral infection. By early 2020, the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, had spread globally, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The infection and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 make it amenable to tracking movement and evolution by viral genome sequencing. Efforts to develop effective public health policies, therapeutics, or vaccines to treat or prevent COVID-19 are also expected to benefit from tracking mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here we describe a set of comprehensive working protocols, from viral RNA extraction to analysis using online visualization tools, for high throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes using a MinION instrument. This set of protocols should serve as a reliable how-to reference for generating quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with ARTIC primer sets and next-generation nanopore sequencing technology. In addition, many of the preparation, quality control, and analysis steps will be generally applicable to other sequencing platforms.",Adrian A Pater; Michael S Bosmeny; Mansi Parasrampuria; Seth B Eddington; Katy N Ovington; Adam A White; Christopher L Barkau; Paige E Metz; Rourke J Sylvain; Ramdevi Chilamkurthy; Abadat O Yinusa; Scott W Benzinger; Madison M Hebert; Keith T Gagnon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430478,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430478,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
325,"Transformations, Comparisons, and Analysis of Down to Up Protomer States of Variants of the SARS-CoV-2 Prefusion Spike Protein Including the UK Variant B.1.1.7","Monitoring and strategic response to variants in SARS-CoV-2 represents a considerable challenge in the current pandemic, as well as potentially future viral outbreaks of similar magnitude. In particular mutations and deletions involving the virions prefusion Spike protein has significant potential impact on vaccines and therapeutics that utilize this key structural viral protein in their mitigation strategies. In this study, we have demonstrated how dominant energetic landscape mappings (""glue points"") coupled with sequence alignment information can potentially identify or flag key residue mutations and deletions associated with variants. Surprisingly, we also found excellent homology of stabilizing residue glue points across the lineage of {beta} coronavirus Spike proteins, and we have termed this as ""sequence homologous glue points"". In general, these flagged residue mutations and/or deletions are then computationally studied in detail using all-atom biocomputational molecular dynamics over approximately one microsecond in order to ascertain structural and energetic changes in the Spike protein associated variants. Specifically, we examined both a theoretically-based triple mutant and the so called UK or B.1.1.7 variant. For the theoretical triple mutant, we demonstrated through Alanine mutations, which help ""unglue"" key residue-residue interactions, that these three key stabilizing residues could cause the transition of Down to Up protomer states, where the Up protomer state allows binding of the prefusion Spike protein to hACE2 host cell receptors, whereas the Down state is believed inaccessible. For the B.1.1.7 variant, we demonstrated the critical importance of D614G and N5017 on the structure and binding of the Spike protein associated variant. In particular, we had previously identified D614 as a key glue point in the inter-protomer stabilization of the Spike protein. Other mutations and deletions associated with this variant did not appear to play a pivotal role in structure or binding changes. The mutant D614G is a structure breaking Glycine mutation demonstrating a relatively large hinge angle and highly stable Up conformation in agreement with previous studies. In addition, we demonstrate that the mutation N501Y may significantly increase the Spike protein binding to hACE2 cell receptors through its interaction with Y41 of hACE2 forming a potentially strong hydrophobic residue binding pair. We note that these two key mutations, D614G and N501Y, are also found in the so-called South African (SA; B.1.351) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Future studies along these lines are therefore aimed at mapping glue points to residue mutations and deletions of associated prefusion Spike protein variants in order to help direct and optimize efforts aimed at the mitigation of this deadly virion.",michael h peters; Oscar Basidas; Daniel Kokron; Christopher E.

326,Energetic and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein co-assemblies with nucleic acids,"Nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus packages the viral genome into well-defined ribonucleoprotein particles, but the molecular pathway is still unclear. N-protein is dimeric and consists of two folded domains with nucleic acid (NA) binding sites, surrounded by intrinsically disordered regions that promote liquid-liquid phase separation. Here we use biophysical tools to study N-protein interactions with oligonucleotides of different length, examining the size, composition, secondary structure, and energetics of the resulting states. We observe formation of supramolecular clusters or nuclei preceding growth into phase-separated droplets. Short hexanucleotide NA forms compact 2:2 N-protein/NA complexes with reduced disorder. Longer oligonucleotides expose additional N-protein interactions and multi-valent protein-NA interactions, which generate higher-order mixed oligomers and simultaneously promote growth of droplets. Phase separation is accompanied by a significant increase in protein secondary structure, different from that caused by initial NA binding, which may contribute to the assembly of ribonucleoprotein particles within molecular condensates.",Huaying Zhao; Di Wu; Ai Nguyen; Yan Li; Regina Ad&atildeo; Eugene Valkov; George H Patterson; Grzegorz Piszczek; Peter Schuck,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.430344,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.430344,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
327,GABA administration limits viral replication and pneumonitis in a mouse model of COVID-19,"Despite the availability of vaccines for COVID-19, serious illness and death induced by coronavirus infection will remain a global health burden because of vaccination hesitancy, possible virus mutations, and the appearance of novel coronaviruses. Accordingly, there is a need for new approaches to limit severe illness stemming from coronavirus infections. Cells of the immune system and lung epithelia express receptors for GABA (GABA-Rs), a widely used neurotransmitter within the CNS. GABA-R agonists have anti-inflammatory effects and can limit acute lung injury. We previously showed that GABA treatment effectively reduced disease severity and death rates in mice following infection with a coronavirus (MHV-1) which provides a potentially lethal model of COVID-19. Here, we report that GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs, suggesting that GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit pulmonary coronavirus replication. Histopathological analysis revealed that GABA treatment reduced lung inflammatory infiltrates and damages. Since GABA is safe for human consumption, inexpensive, and available worldwide, it is a promising candidate to help treat COVID-19.",Jide Tian; Blake Middleton; Daniel L Kaufman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430446,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.09.430446,2021-02-09,2021-02-09,,False
328,SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Risk from sports Equipment (STRIKE),"OBJECTIVESTo investigate the potential of shared sporting equipment as transmission vectors of SARS-CoV-2 during the reintroduction of sports such as soccer, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and gymnastics.

SETTINGLaboratory based live SARS-CoV-2 virus study

INTERVENTIONSTen different types of sporting equipment were inoculated with 40l droplets containing clinically relevant high and low concentrations of live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Materials were then swabbed at time points relevant to sports (1, 5, 15, 30, 90 minutes). The amount of live SARS-CoV-2 recovered at each time point was enumerated using viral plaque assays, and viral decay and half-life was estimated through fitting linear models to log transformed data from each material.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREThe primary outcome measure was quantification of retrievable SARS-CoV-2 virus from each piece of equipment at pre-determined time points.

RESULTSAt one minute, SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered in only seven of the ten types of equipment with the low dose inoculum, one at five minutes and none at 15 minutes. Retrievable virus dropped significantly for all materials tested using the high dose inoculum with mean recovery of virus falling to 0.74% at 1 minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes. Viral recovery, predicted decay, and half-life varied between materials with porous surfaces limiting virus transmission.

CONCLUSIONSThis study shows that there is an exponential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 recoverable from a range of sports equipment after a short time period, and virus is less transferrable from materials such as a tennis ball, red cricket ball and cricket glove. Given this rapid loss of viral load and the fact that transmission requires a significant inoculum to be transferred from equipment to the mucous membranes of another individual it seems unlikely that sports equipment is a major cause for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These findings have important policy implications in the context of the pandemic and may promote other infection control measures in sports to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and urge sports equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may or may not be likely to retain transferable virus.

O_TEXTBOXWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LITransmission of SARS-CoV-2 between individuals playing sport may be via respiratory droplets when in close proximity to an infected person.
C_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 remains viable on a variety of surfaces resulting in recommendations to reduce the sharing of sports equipment such as tennis balls when sports were re-opened.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIThe recoverable SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduces exponentially with mean viral load of all materials less than 1% of the original inoculum after 1 minute.
C_LIO_LIThe type of material has a significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 transfer, with less virus transferred from porous materials such as bovine leather or nylon woven cloth.
C_LIO_LIPolicies on infection control measures in sport may be better directed towards areas other than reducing the sharing of sports equipment.
C_LIO_LISports equipment manufacturers may consider using materials that absorb or retain virus as a way of reducing viral transmission from sports equipment.

329,Implementation of an in-house real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant,"IntroductionThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with the occurrence since summer 2020 of several viral variants that overlapped or succeeded each other in time. Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477N substitution in this RBD.

Materials and methodsWe aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant.

ResultsAll 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93%) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 1,585/2,889 patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6%) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR.

DiscussionOur in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in more than half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data.",Marielle Bedotto; Pierre-Edouard Fournier; Linda Houhamdi; Anthony LEVASSEUR; Jeremy Delerce; Lucine Pinault; Abdou Padane; Amanda CHAMIEH; Herve TISSOT-DUPONT; Philippe BROUQUI; Cheikh Sokhna; Eid Azar; Rachid Saile; Souleymane Mboup; Idir Bitam; Philippe Colson; Didier Raoult,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250823,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250823,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
330,TOP-Plus is a Versatile Biosensor Platform for Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Durability,"BackgroundThere is a concern that low initial SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in individuals may drop to undetectable levels within months after infection. Although this may raise concerns over long term immunity, both the antibody levels and avidity of the antibody-antigen interaction should be examined to understand the quality of the antibody response.

MethodsA testing-on-a-probe ""plus"" panel (TOP-Plus) was developed, which included a newly developed avidity assay built into the previously described SARS-CoV-2 TOP assays that measured total antibody (TAb), surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb), IgM and IgG on a versatile biosensor platform. TAb and SNAb levels were compared with avidity in previously infected individuals at 1.3 and 6.2 months post-infection in paired samples from 80 COVID-19 patients.

ResultsThe newly designed avidity assay in this TOP panel correlated well with a reference Bio-Layer Interferometry avidity assay (R=0.88). The imprecision of the TOP avidity assay was less than 9%. Although TAb and neutralization activity (by SNAb) decreased between 1.3 and 6.2 months post infection, the antibody avidity increased significantly (P < 0.0001).

ConclusionThis highly precise and versatile TOP-Plus panel with the ability to measure SARS-CoV-2 TAb, SNAb, IgG and IgM antibody levels and avidity of individual sera on one sensor can become a valuable asset in monitoring not only SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, but also the status of individuals COVID-19 vaccination response.",Sabrina E Racine-Brzostek; Mohsen Karbaschi; Christian Gaebler; PJ Klasse; Jim Yee; Marina Caskey; He S Yang; Ying Hao; Amy Chadburn; Yuanyuan Shi; Robert Zuk; Michel C Nussenzweig; Melissa M Cushing; Zhen Zhao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251089,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251089,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True

Transmission was more likely from teachers than from students/children (incidence risk ratio [IRR] 3{middle dot}17, 1{middle dot}79-5{middle dot}59), and from index cases in day-care centres (IRR 3{middle dot}23, 1{middle dot}76-5{middle dot}91) than from those in secondary schools. In 748 index cases, teachers caused four times more secondary cases than children (1{middle dot}08 vs. 0{middle dot}25 secondary cases per index, IRR 4{middle dot}39, 2{middle dot}67-7{middle dot}21). This difference was mainly due to a large number of teacher-to-teacher transmissions in day-care centres (mean number of secondary cases 0.66) and a very low number of student/child-to-teacher transmissions in schools (mean number of secondary cases 0.004).

InterpretationIn educational institutions, the risk of infection for contacts to a confirmed COVID-19 case is one percent, but varies depending on type of institution and index case. Hygiene measures and vaccination targeting the day-care setting and teacher-to-teacher transmission are priorities in reducing the burden of infection and may promote educational justice during the pandemic.

FundingNo particular funding was received for this study.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed on Jan 27, 2021, without any language restrictions for all articles in which the title or abstract contained the search terms ""COVID 19"" or ""corona"", and ""school"", ""education*"", or ""daycare"", and ""transmission"", and ""risk"", ""attack rate"", or ""SAR"", and screened 175 results for original research or reviews on COVID-19 transmission risk in the educational setting. Following a similar strategy, we also searched Google Scholar, SSRN, medRxiv, and the reference lists of identified literature. We found five cohort studies on transmission risk looking at overall 171 index cases and their 6,910 contact persons in Australian, Italian, Irish, Singaporean, and German schools and reporting attack rates between 0% and 3% percent. These five studies were conducted before October 2020 and thus looked at COVID-19 transmission risk in schools before the second wave in Europe.

A number of modelling studies from the first wave of COVID-19 provide inconclusive guidance to policy makers. While two publications, one from several countries and one from Switzerland, concluded that school closures contributed markedly to the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and individual mobility, two other studies, one using cross-country data and one from Japan rated school closures among the least effective measures to reduce COVID-19 incidence rates.

Added value of this studyBased on a large data set that emerged from the current public health practice in Germany, which incorporates routine PCR-testing during active follow-up of asymptomatic high-risk contacts to index cases, this study provides a precise estimate of the true underlying SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk in schools and day-care centres. Its analysis also allows for a meaningful examination of differences in the risk of transmission with respect to the characteristics of the index case. We found that the individual risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 among high-risk contacts in the educational setting is 1.3%, but that this risk rises to 3.2% when the index case is a teacher and to 2.5% when the index case occurs in a day-care centre. Furthermore, we could show that, on average, teacher index cases produced about four times as many secondary cases as student/child index cases. Despite the relatively small proportion of teachers among index cases (20%), our study of transmission pathways revealed that the majority of all secondary cases (54%), and the overwhelming majority of secondary cases in teachers (78%) were caused by teacher index cases. Of note, most cases of teacher-to-teacher transmission (85%) occurred in day-care centres.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn this setting, where preventative measures are in place and COVID-19 incidence rates were rising sharply in the population, we found a low and stable transmission risk in educational institutions over time, which provides evidence for the effectiveness of current preventative measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in schools. The identification of a substantial teacher-to-teacher transmission risk in day-care, but a clearly mitigated child/student-to-teacher transmission risk in schools, indicates the need to shift the focus to hygiene among day-care teachers, including infection prevention during staff-meetings and in break rooms. These findings also strongly support the re-prioritization of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 to educational staff in day-care.",Anja Schoeps; Dietmar Hoffmann; Claudia Tamm; Bianca Vollmer; Sabine Haag; Tina Kaffenberger; Kimberly Ferguson-Beiser; Berit Kohlhase-Griebel; Silke Basenach; Andrea Missal; Katja Hoefling; Harald Michels; Anett Schall; Holger Kappes; Manfred Vogt; Klaus Jahn; Till Baernighausen; Philipp Zanger,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250670,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250670,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
332,Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 stains harbouring the signature mutations of both A2a and A3 clade,"SARS-CoV-2 strains with both high transmissibility and potential to cause asymptomatic infection is expected to gain selective advantage over other circulating strains having either high transmissibility or ability to trigger asymptomatic infection. The D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein, the characteristic mutation A2a clade, has been associated with high transmissibility, whereas the A3 clade specific mutation L37F in NSP6 protein has been linked with asymptomatic infection. In this study, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected during January, 2020 to December, 2020 from all across the world for the presence of D614G and L37F mutations. Out of 3,77,129 SARS-CoV-2 strains analysed, 14, 598 (3.87%) were found to harbour both the D614G and L37F mutations. Majority of these double mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains were identified in Europe (11097) followed by North America (1915), Asia (980), Oceania (242), Africa (219), and South America (145). Geographical root surveillance revealed their first emergence during February-March in all the six continents. Temporal prevalence analysis from February, 2020 to December, 2020 showed a gradual upsurge in their frequencies worldwide, which strongly demonstrated the adaptive selection of these double mutants. Evolutionary analysis depicted that these double mutants emerged as a new clade in the dendrogram (named as A2a/3), and were sub-divided into four distinct clusters (Cluster I, II, III and IV) according to different sets of coexisting mutations. The frequency distribution pattern showed the global predominance of cluster III (41.42%), followed by cluster IV (23.31%), cluster II (21.02%) and cluster I (14.25%). Overall, our study highlighted the emergence of a unique phylogenetic clade encompassing the double-mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains which may provide a fitness advantage during course of virus evolution.",Rakesh Sarkar; Dr. Anindita Banerjee; Shanta Dutta; Dr. Mamta Chawla-Sarkar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251117,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251117,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True

State-level seroprevalence was 31.6%. However, this masks substantial variation across the state. Seroprevalence ranged from just 11.1% in The Nilgris to 51.0% in Perambalur district. Seroprevalence in urban areas (36.9%) was higher than in rural areas (26.9%). Females (30.8%) had similar seroprevalence to males (30.3%). However, working age populations (age 40-49: 31.6%) have significantly higher seroprevalence than the youth (age 18-29: 30.7%) or elderly (age 70+: 25.8%). Estimated seroprevalence implies that at least 22.6 million persons were infected by the end of November, roughly 36 times the number of confirmed cases. Estimated seroprevalence implies an infection fatality rate of 0.052%.",Anup Malani; Sabareesh Ramachandran; Vaidehi Tandel; Rajeswari Parasa; S Sudharshini; V. Prakash; Y. Yogananth; S. Raju; T.S.

334,Inhaled budesonide in the treatment of early COVID-19 illness: a randomised controlled trial,"BackgroundMultiple early hospital cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showed that patients with chronic respiratory disease were significantly under-represented. We hypothesised that the widespread use of inhaled glucocorticoids was responsible for this finding and tested if inhaled glucorticoids would be an effective treatment for early COVID-19 illness.

MethodsWe conducted a randomised, open label trial of inhaled budesonide, compared to usual care, in adults within 7 days of the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was COVID-19-related urgent care visit, emergency department assessment or hospitalisation. The trial was stopped early after independent statistical review concluded that study outcome would not change with further participant enrolment.

Results146 patients underwent randomisation. For the per protocol population (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in 10 participants and 1 participant in the usual care and budesonide arms respectively (difference in proportion 0.131, p=0.004). The number needed to treat with inhaled budesonide to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was 8. Clinical recovery was 1 day shorter in the budesonide arm compared to the usual care arm (median of 7 days versus 8 days respectively, logrank test p=0.007). Proportion of days with a fever and proportion of participants with at least 1 day of fever was lower in the budesonide arm. Fewer participants randomised to budesonide had persistent symptoms at day 14 and day 28 compared to participants receiving usual care.

ConclusionEarly administration of inhaled budesonide reduced the likelihood of needing urgent medical care and reduced time to recovery following early COVID-19 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe majority of interventions studied for the COVID-19 pandemic are focused on hospitalised patients. Widely available and broadly relevant interventions for mild COVID-19 are urgently needed.

Added value of this studyIn this open label randomised controlled trial, inhaled budesonide, when given to adults with early COVID-19 illness, reduces the likelihood of requiring urgent care, emergency department consultation or hospitalisation. There was also a quicker resolution of fever, a known poor prognostic marker in COVID-19 and a faster self-reported and questionnaire reported symptom resolution. There were fewer participants with persistent COVID-19 symptoms at 14 and 28 days after budesonide therapy compared to usual care.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe STOIC trial potentially provides the first easily accessible effective intervention in early COVID-19. By assessing health care resource utilisation, the study provides an exciting option to help with the worldwide pressure on health care systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

335,DrugWAS: Leveraging drug-wide association studies to facilitate drug repurposing for COVID-19,"ImportanceThere is an unprecedented need to rapidly identify safe and effective treatments for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

ObjectiveTo systematically investigate if any of the available drugs in Electronic Health Record (EHR), including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, can be repurposed as potential treatment for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsBased on a retrospective cohort analysis of EHR data, drug-wide association studies (DrugWAS) were performed on COVID-19 patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). For each drug study, multivariable logistic regression with overlap weighting using propensity score was applied to estimate the effect of drug exposure on COVID-19 disease outcomes.

ExposuresPatient exposure to a drug during 1-year prior to the pandemic and COVID-19 diagnosis was chosen as exposure of interest. Natural language processing was employed to extract drug information from clinical notes, in addition to the prescription drug data available in structured format.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause of death was selected as primary outcome. Hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and need for mechanical ventilation were identified as secondary outcomes.

ResultsThe study included 7,768 COVID-19 patients, of which 509 (6.55%) were hospitalized, 82 (1.06%) were admitted to ICU, 64 (0.82%) received mechanical ventilation, and 90 (1.16%) died. Overall, 15 drugs were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 severity. Previous exposure to either Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.98), diphtheria toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98), and tetanus toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (primary outcome). Secondary analyses identified several other significant associations showing lower risk for COVID-19 outcomes: 2 vaccines (acellular pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae), 3 dietary supplements (turmeric extract, flaxseed extract, omega-3 fatty acids), methylprednisolone acetate, pseudoephedrine, ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, ibuprofen, and fluticasone.

Conclusions and RelevanceThis cohort study leveraged EHR data to identify a list of drugs that could be repurposed to improve COVID-19 outcomes. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of the proposed drugs.

336,Using Machine Learning to Predict Mortality for COVID-19 Patients on Day Zero in the ICU,"RationaleGiven the expanding number of COVID-19 cases and the potential for upcoming waves of infection, there is an urgent need for early prediction of the severity of the disease in intensive care unit (ICU) patients to optimize treatment strategies.

ObjectivesEarly prediction of mortality using machine learning based on typical laboratory results and clinical data registered on the day of ICU admission.

MethodsWe studied retrospectively 263 COVID-19 ICU patients. To find parameters with the highest predictive values, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Pearson chi-squared tests were used. Logistic regression and random forest (RF) algorithms were utilized to build classification models. The impact of each marker on the RF model predictions was studied by implementing the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation technique (LIME-SP).

ResultsAmong 66 documented parameters, 15 factors with the highest predictive values were identified as follows: gender, age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, mean corpuscular volume, white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean cell hemoglobin along with a history of neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory disorders. Our RF model can predict patients outcomes with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 75%.

ConclusionsThe most decisive variables in our model were increased levels of BUN, lowered albumin levels, increased creatinine, INR, and RDW along with gender and age. Complete blood count parameters were also crucial for some patients. Considering the importance of early triage decisions, this model can be a useful tool in COVID-19 ICU decision-making.",Elham Jamshidi; Amirhossein Asgary; Nader Tavakoli; Alireza Zali; Hadi Esmaily; Seyed Hamid Jamaldini; Amir Daaee; Amirhesam Babajani; Mohammad Ali Sendani Kashi; Masoud Jamshidi; Sahand Rahi; Nahal Mansouri,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251131,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251131,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
337,Symptoms of COVID-19 infection and magnitude of antibody response in a large community-based study,"BackgroundThe majority of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, or minimally symptomatic with management in the home. Little is known about the frequency of specific symptoms in the general population, and how symptoms predict the magnitude of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsWe quantified IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in home-collected dried blood spot samples from 3,365 adults participating in a community-based seroprevalence study in the city of Chicago, USA, collected between June 24 and November 11, 2020.

Results17.8% of the sample was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. A cluster of symptoms (loss of sense of smell or taste, fever, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches, cough, fatigue, diarrhea, headache) was associated with stronger anti-RBD IgG responses among the seropositives. 39.2% of infections were asymptomatic, and 2 or fewer symptoms were reported for 66.7% of infections. Total number of symptoms was positively but weakly associated with IgG response: Median anti-RBD IgG was 0.95 ug/mL for individuals with 3 or more symptoms, in comparison with 0.61 ug/mL for asymptomatic infections.

ConclusionWe document high rates of asymptomatic and mild infection in a large community-based cohort, and relatively low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in the general population of previously exposed individuals.",Thomas W McDade; Joshua Schrock; Richard D'Aquila; Brian Mustanski; Nanette Benbow; Lauren Vaught; Nina Reiser; Matt Velez; Ryan Hsieh; Daniel Ryan; Rana Saber; ELIZABETH MCNALLY; Alexis R.

338,Longitudinal serology in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in India - a prospective cohort study,"Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are now widely available, but there are few data on longitudinal serology in large cohorts, particularly from low-and middle-income countries. We established an ongoing prospective cohort of 3840 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals in the Delhi-National Capital Region of India, to document clinical and immunological characteristics during illness and convalescence. The IgG responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid were assessed at 0-7, 10-28 days and 6-10 weeks after infection. The clinical predictors of seroconversion were identified by multivariable regression analysis. The seroconversion rates in the post-infection windows of 0-7 days, 10-28 days and 6-10 weeks were 46%, 84.7% and 85.3% respectively (n=782). The proportion with a serological response increased with severity of COVID-19 disease. All participants with severe disease, 89.6% with mild to moderate infection and 77.3% of asymptomatic participants had IgG antibodies to the RBD antigen. The threshold values in the nasopharyngeal viral RNA RT-PCR in a subset of asymptomatic and symptomatic seroconverters were comparable (p value: 0.48), with similar results among non-seroconverters (p value: 0.16) (n=169). This is the first report of longitudinal humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a period of ten weeks from South Asia. The low seropositivity in asymptomatic participants and differences between assays highlight the importance of contextualizing the understanding of population serosurveys.

SummaryWe measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NC protein IgG in a multi-hospital-based prospective cohort from northern India up to ten weeks post-infection.

339,Introduction of a hand dermatitis clinic to reduce occupational dermatoses during the covid-19 pandemic.,"BackgroundThe SARS-Co-V pandemic has necessitated strict hand hygiene practices in healthcare settings. An increased incidence of staff presentations of occupational dermatitis in our institutions prompted the establishment of a drop-in access daily hand dermatitis clinic.

Objectiveto document the incidence and severity of cases of occupational dermatitis arising in healthcare workers during the first wave of the pandemic, and to reduce the impact of this with early assessment and treatment.

Methodsan open-access daily staff clinic run by dermatologists was established, and demographic and clinical data collected from each clinical encounter.

Results532 staff attended the clinic over a 6 week period. This compared to 7 staff presenting to occupational health over the same period in 2019. The majority were females 81%,and ward based 51%. ITU and A&E staff represented 15%. The prevalence of occupational hand dermatitis was 88%. 52% were classed as mild, 26% as moderate 26% and 9% severe/very severe.

The model is validated with the COVID-19 cases, deaths, and the number of patients in ICUs and ventilation units as reported by Turkey Department of Health for the period March 11 through May 30 when the nationwide lockdown is in order. COVID-19 interventions in Turkey are incorporated into the model to detect the future trend of the outbreak accurately. The lockdown is lifted on June 1, and the model is modified to include a time dependent transmission rate which is linked to the effective reproduction number [R]t through basic reproduction number [R]0. The modified model captures the changing dynamics and peaks of the outbreak successfully. With the onset of vaccination on 13 January 2021, we augment the model with the vaccination class to investigate the impact of vaccination rate and efficacy.

341,COVID-19 prevention behaviour over time in Australia: Patterns and long-term predictors from April to July 2020,"BackgroundIn Australia in March 2020 a national public health directive required that non-essential workers stay at home, except for essential activities. These restrictions began easing in May 2020 as community transmission slowed.

PurposeThis study investigated changes in COVID-19 prevention behaviours from April-July 2020, and psychosocial predictors of these behaviours.

Methods1,843 participants in Australia completed a national COVID-19 survey in April, with monthly follow-up over four months. Principal components analysis (PCA) combined self-reported adherence across seven prevention behaviours. Multivariable regression models explored baseline (April) correlates of behaviour in June (a period of low community transmission) and July (a period of increasing community transmission).

ResultsOn average, participants agreed with statements of adherence for all behaviours (means all above 4 out of 7). PCA identified two behaviour types:  distancing (e.g. staying 1.5m away) and  hygiene (e.g. washing hands), explaining 28.3% and 24.2% of variance, respectively. Distancing declined each month (ps<.001), whereas hygiene remained relatively stable. For distancing, stronger perceptions of societal risk, self-efficacy to maintain distancing, and greater perceived social obligation at baseline were associated with adherence in June and July (ps<0.05). For hygiene, the only significant correlate of adherence in June and July was belief that ones actions could prevent infection of family members (p<.001).

ConclusionsHigh adherence to COVID-19 prevention behaviours were reported; however, distancing behaviours tended to decrease over time. Belief in social responsibility may be an important aspect to consider in encouraging distancing behaviours.

342,Impact of school closures on the health and well-being of primary school children in Wales UK; a routine data linkage study using the HAPPEN survey (2018-2020).,"IntroductionIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, school closures were implemented across the United Kingdom. This study aimed to explore the impact of school closures on childrens health by comparing health and wellbeing outcomes collected during school closures (April - June 2020) with data from the same period in 2019 and 2018.

MethodsData were collected online via the  HAPPEN At Home survey, which captured the typical health behaviours of children aged 8 - 11 years between April - June 2020. These data were compared with data in 2018 and 2019 also collected between April-June, from HAPPEN. Free school meal (FSM) status was used as a proxy for socio-economic deprivation. Analyses were repeated stratifying by FSM.

ResultsComparing responses between April - June in 2020 (n=1068), 2019 (n=1150) and 2018 (n=475), there were improvements in physical activity levels, sleep time, happiness and general wellbeing for children during school closures compared to previous years. However, children on FSM ate less fruit and vegetables (21% (95%CI (5.7% to 37%)) and had lower self-assessed school competence compared to 2019. Compared to those not on FSM they also spent less time doing physical activity (13.03% (95%CI: 3.3% to 21.7%) and consumed more takeaways (16.3% (95%CI: 2%-30%)) during school closures.

ConclusionThis study suggests that schools play an important role in reducing inequalities in physical health. The physical health (e.g. physical activity and diet) of children eligible for FSM may be impacted by prolonged school closures.

What is already known on this subject?In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, by mid-March 2020, 138 countries had implemented national school closures to reduce the number of social contacts between pupils, therefore interrupting the transmission of COVID-19 as part of pandemic plans. UNESCO warned that the global scale and speed of the educational disruption would be unparalleled. There is an ongoing debate with regard to the effectiveness of schools closures on transmission rates, but the fact schools are closed for a long period of time could have detrimental impacts on pupils physical and mental health.

This study provides evidence of any differences in the health and wellbeing of children prior to and during the COVID-19 enforced lockdown and school closures between March and June 2020. These findings could have a significant impact for the future and support schools to better understand their pupils physical, psychological, emotional and social health. It also contributes to a significant literature gap regarding the impact of school closures on school-aged children.

What this study adds?Improvements in physical activity levels, sleep time, happiness and general wellbeing were observed in general for children during school closures compared to previous years. However, children on FSM reported eating less fruit and vegetables and had lower self-assessed school competence compared to 2019. Compared to those not on FSM they also spent less time doing physical activity and consumed more takeaways during school closures. These trends are not evident among children not on FSM. All children reported improvements in wellbeing during lockdown especially on the happiness with family measure.

Overall, findings suggest schools help to reduce inequalities in physical health for socio-economically deprived children. During school closures children from deprived backgrounds are likely to have poorer physical health (e.g. less time spent doing physical activities and poorer diet) and this is not observed in children who are not in receipt of FSM. This research suggests that school closures will result in widening health inequalities and when schools return measures will need to be in place to readdress the widened gap in physical health.",Michaela James; Emily Marchant; Margaret A Defeyter; Jayne V Woodside; Sinead Brophy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251155,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251155,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
343,Enhancing Food Security for Families Vulnerable to COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed some of the underlying inequities in our society. Vulnerable and low-income communities who have typically struggled with food insecurity have been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To make matters worse, transit dependent households in the City of Detroit that rely on SNAP benefits from the government have a 54% probability of not having internet access, reducing the possibility of online food delivery. Thus, the motivation for the Detroit Food Delivery Pilot Program, a prepared meal delivery service for food insecure households during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this program, the City had aided 350 households; over 1,000 unique individuals and has served over 90,000 meals. This had all been made possible through the engagement of 575 volunteers, volunteering over 6,850 delivery miles. Our team helped to identify the magnitude and the needs of the Citys food insecure population; then partnered with the City of Detroit to modify existing food programs to address the crisis, and finally, assessed the impact of the program on the target population. Our analysis revealed that approximately 20,800 households will be classified as food insecure in Detroit and only a fraction of this population is benefitting from the food delivery pilot program. However, on average, the concerns about food sufficiency have abated appreciably from the surveys analyzed. Responses from the beneficiaries of the food delivery pilot program were positive though concerns about the travel behavior of individuals, particularly those from COVID-19 positive households remain.",Tayo Fabusuyi; Aditi Misra; Jon Martinez; Andong Chen; Vivian Jiang; H.

344,Staff-Pupil SARS-CoV-2 Infection Pathways in Schools: A Population Level Linked Data Approach,"BackgroundBetter understanding of the role that children and school staff play in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to guide policy development on controlling infection whilst minimising disruption to childrens education and wellbeing.

MethodsOur national e-cohort (n=500,779) study used anonymised linked data for pupils, staff and associated households linked via educational settings. We estimated the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection for staff and pupils over the period August - December 2020, dependent on measures of recent exposure to known cases linked to their educational settings.

ResultsThe total number of cases in a school was not associated with a subsequent increase in the risk of testing positive (Staff OR per case 0.92, 95%CI 0.85, 1.00; Pupils OR per case 0.98, 95%CI 0.93, 1.02). Amongst pupils, the number of recent cases within the same year group was significantly associated with subsequent increased risk of testing positive (OR per case 1.12, 95%CI 1.08 - 1.15). These effects were adjusted for a range of demographic covariates, and in particular any known cases within the same household, which had the strongest association with testing positive (Staff OR 39.86, 95%CI 35.01, 45.38, pupil OR 9.39, 95%CI 8.94 - 9.88).

ConclusionsIn a national school cohort, the odds of staff testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not significantly increased in the 14-day period after case detection in the school. However, pupils were found to be at increased risk, following cases appearing within their own year group, where most of their contacts occur. Strong mitigation measures over the whole of the study period may have reduced wider spread within the school environment.

345,A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic,"The effective reproduction number Reff is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic.

In this work, we propose to estimate Reff for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted with Bayesian inference (PMCMC) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland.

This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data, without any specific hypothesis on its evolution. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its Reff(t). In this way, we can appropriately assess the effect of the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland.",Bernard Cazelles; Clara Champagne; Benjamin Nguyen Van Yen; Catherine Comiskey; Elisabeta Vergu; Benjamin Roche,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251167,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251167,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
346,Mapping internet activity in Australian cities during COVID-19 lockdown: how occupational factors drive inequality,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence has accumulated that movement restrictions enacted to combat virus spread produce disparate consequences along socioeconomic lines. One explanation for this differential impact is the distribution of people into occupations that can be performed from home and may provide greater financial security. However, little is known about the nature and scale of shifting home-based work patterns and their geographic distribution, despite this being a likely determinant of the success of geographically defined COVID-19 lockdown strategies. We investigate the hypothesis that people engaged in financially secure employment are better able to adapt to mobility restrictions, due to common occupational factors. In the context of two Australian urban centres, we test this hypothesis by analysing changes to home-based internet usage and quantify the relationship between area-level measures of population income security, the ability to perform job requirements remotely, and the degree of transition to home-based work during COVID-19. Our analysis confirms that financial security in Australia is geographically clustered and concentrated. Income security is also correlated with increased internet traffic during work hours under lockdown, and home-based work patterns that persist post-lockdown. Our findings suggest that geographic diversity in preparedness for government-imposed restrictions should be factored into response planning and provision of social and economic support for residents within lockdown areas.",Cameron Zachreson; Erika Martino; Martin Tomko; Freya M Shearer; Rebecca Bentley; Nicholas Geard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251171,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251171,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
347,Development and validation of an algorithm to estimate the risk of severe complications of COVID-19 to prioritise vaccination,"ObjectiveTo develop an algorithm (sCOVID) to predict the risk of severe complications of COVID- 19 in a community-dwelling population to optimise vaccination scenarios.

DesignPopulation based cohort study

Setting264 Dutch general practices contributing to the NL-COVID database

Participants6074 people aged 0-99 diagnosed with COVID-19

Main outcome measuresSevere complications (hospitalisation, institutionalisation, death). The algorithm was developed from a training dataset comprising 70% of the patients and validated in the remaining 30%. Potential predictor variables included age, sex, a chronic co-morbidity score (CCS) based on risk factors for COVID-19 complications as defined by the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), obesity, neighborhood deprivation score (NDS), first or second COVID wave, and confirmation test. Six different population vaccination scenarios were explored: 1) random (naive), 2) random for persons above 60 years (60plus), 3) oldest patients first in age bands of five years (oldest first), 4) target population of the annual influenza vaccination program (influenza) and 5) those 25-65 years of age first (worker), and 6) risk-based using the prediction algorithm (sCOVID). For each vaccination strategy the amount of vaccinations needed to reach a 50% reduction of severe complications was calculated.

ResultsSevere complications were reported in 243 (4.8%) people with 59 (20.3%) nursing home admissions, 181 (62.2%) hospitalisations and 51 (17.5%) deaths. The algorithm included age, sex, CCS, NDS, wave, and confirmation test with a c statistic of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.94) in the validation set. Applied to different vaccination scenarios, the proportion of people needed to be vaccinated to reach a 50% reduction of severe complications was 67.5%, 50.0%, 26.1%, 16.0%, 10.0%, and 8.4% for the worker, naive, infuenza, 60plus, oldest first, and sCOVID scenarios respectively.

ConclusionCOVID-19 related severe complications will be reduced most efficiently when vaccinations are risk-based, prioritizing the highest risk group using the sCOVID algorithm. The vaccination scenario, prioritising oldest people in age bands of 5 years down to 60 years of age, performed second best. The sCOVID algorithm can readily be applied to identify persons with highest risks from data in the electronic health records of GPs.

Four adenovirus vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) protein have advanced into phase 3 trials, with three approved for use. Here, we generated several recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S, receptor-binding domain (RBD) or dimeric tandem-repeat RBD (RBD-tr2). We found vaccination via either intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in mice to elicit both humoral and cellular (Th1-based) immune responses. AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody responses compared with both AdC7-S and AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either single-dose or two-dose mucosal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and relieved lung injury.

349,Impact of cobas PCR Media Freezing on SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA Integrity and Whole Genome Sequencing Analyses,"SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is an important molecular biology tool performed to support many aspects of the response to the pandemic. Freezing of primary clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples and shipment to reference laboratories is usually required since RNA sequencing is rarely available in routine clinical microbiology laboratories where initial diagnosis and support to outbreak investigations occur. The cobas PCR Media transport medium developed by Roche facilitates high throughput analyses on cobas multianalyzer PCR platforms. There is no data on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after freezing and thawing of clinical samples in this transport medium, but potential denaturing of the molecular template could impair test results. Our objective was to compare the quality and results of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing when performed on fresh or frozen samples in cobas PCR Media. Viral whole genome sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform. Genomic coverage and sequencing depth did not significantly differ between fresh and frozen samples (n=10). For samples with lower viral inoculum and PCR cycle threshold above 30, sequencing quality scores and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ either. Freezing of cobas PCR Media does not negatively affect the quality of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing results and it is therefore a suitable transport medium for outsourcing sequencing analyses to reference laboratories. Those results support secondary use of diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab material for viral sequencing without requirement for additional clinical samples.",Patrick Benoit; Cecile Tremblay; P.

To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we performed untargeted metabolomics profiling of 341 patients with plasma samples collected at six longitudinal time points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we then built a predictive model of disease severity. We determined that the levels of 25 metabolites measured at the time of hospital admission successfully predict future disease severity. Through analysis of longitudinal samples, we confirmed that these prognostic markers are directly related to disease progression and that their levels are restored to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we validated that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19.

353,Modelling the impact of contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic,"OBJECTIVESWith declining numbers of COVID-19 cases in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, social distancing measures were gradually being lifted. The risk of an increase in the number of cases, however, cannot be overlooked. Even with the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as restrictions on mass gatherings, wearing masks, and complete or partial closure of schools, other public health measures may help to control the epidemic. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic regardless of the use of diagnostic testing.

METHODSWe developed a mathematical model that includes isolation of symptomatic individuals and tracing of contacts to assess the effects of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic in the State of Sao Paulo.

RESULTSFor a selection efficacy (proportion of isolated contacts who are infected) of 80%, cases and deaths may be reduced by 80% after 60 days when 5000 symptomatic individuals are isolated per day, each of them together with 10 contacts. On the other hand, for a selection efficacy of 20%, the number of cases and deaths may be reduced by approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with the scenario in which no contact tracing strategy is performed.

354,Outdoor transmission of COVID-19: Analysis of windspeed,"BackgroundTo examine whether outdoor exposures may contribute to the COVID-19 epidemic, we hypothesized that slower outdoor windspeed is associated with increased risk of transmission when individuals socialize outside.

MethodsDaily COVID-19 incidence reported between 3/16/2020-12/31/2020 was the outcome. Average windspeed and maximal daily temperature were derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Negative binomial regression was used to model incidence, adjusting for susceptible population size.

ResultsCases were very high in the initial wave but diminished quickly once lockdown procedures were enacted. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses revealed that warmer days with windspeed <5.5 MPH had increased COVID-19 incidence (aIRR=1.50, 95% C.I.=[1.25-1.81], P<0.001) as compared to days with average windspeed [&ge;]5.5 MPH.

The constructs ""Velocity"" and ""Increase in Velocity"" were operationalized in terms of rates of transmission events over successive iterations (generations) in a set of CovidSIMVL trials. Treating 40-70% increase in velocity as a target, based on reports in the literature for the UK variant (VUI 202012/01), the series of trials reported in the paper demonstrate the calibration of CovidSIMVL parameters to produce increases in transmission rates of 40-70% above a baseline value. A series of follow-up studies is proposed to evaluate three different possible explanations for reported increases in SARS-Cov2-2 infections that are being attributed to spread of the UK and other variants: (a) simulations where the inherent characteristics of the virus (infectivity) are varied (genomic studies); (b) simulations where the behaviour of agents is varied (e.g., movement within and between spaces) while inherent characteristics of the virus are held constant (behavioural studies); and (c) simulations where both inherent properties of the virus and the behaviour of agents are varying to ""tease out"" the interaction between biologically-based contributions to increased case counts, and contextual/behavioural contributions (epigenetic studies).",Ernie Chang; Kenneth Andrew Moselle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251230,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251230,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
356,How effective was Newfoundland & Labrador's travel ban to prevent the spread of COVID-19? An agent-based analysis,"BackgroundTo prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Newfoundland & Labrador (NL), NL implemented a wide travel ban in May 2020. We estimate the effectiveness of this travel ban using a customized agent-based simulation (ABS).

MethodsWe built an individual-level ABS to simulate the movements and behaviors of every member of the NL population, including arriving and departing travellers. The model considers individual properties (spatial location, age, comorbidities) and movements between environments, as well as age-based disease transmission with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic transmission rates. We examine low, medium, and high travel volume, traveller infection rates, and traveller quarantine compliance rates to determine the effect of travellers on COVID spread, and the ability of contact tracing to contain outbreaks.

ResultsInfected travellers increased COVID cases by 9-136x times and peak hospitalizations by 9-149x, without contact tracing. Although contact tracing was highly effective at reducing spread, it was insufficient to stop outbreaks caused by travellers in even the best-case scenario, and the likelihood of exceeding contact tracing capacity was a concern in most scenarios. Quarantine compliance had only a small impact on COVID spread; travel volume and infection rate drove spread.

InterpretationNLs travel ban was likely a critically important intervention to prevent COVID spread. Even a small number of infected travellers can play a significant role in introducing new chains of transmission, resulting in exponential community spread and significant increases in hospitalizations, while outpacing contact tracing capabilities. With the presence of more transmissible variants, e.g., the UK variant, prevention of imported cases is even more critical.",Dionne M Aleman; Benjamin Z Tham; Sean J Wagner; Justin Semelhago; Asghar Mohammadi; Paul Price; Randy Giffen; Proton Rahman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251157,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251157,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True

Accurate prevalence estimates, however, can be difficult to calculate due to a combination of low population prevalence, imperfect diagnostic tests, and limited testing resources. In addition, strategies based on convenience samples that target only symptomatic or high-risk individuals will yield biased estimates of the population prevalence. We present Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification models that incorporate probability sampling designs, the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test, and specimen pooling to obtain unbiased prevalence estimates. These models easily incorporate all available prior information and can yield reasonable inferences even with very low base rates and limited testing resources. We examine the performance of these models with an extensive numerical study that varies the sampling design, sample size, true prevalence, and pool size. We also demonstrate the relative robustness of the models to key prior distribution assumptions via sensitivity analyses.",Eric J Oh; Alyssa Mikytuck; Vicki Lancaster; Joshua Goldstein; Sallie Keller,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251231,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251231,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True

The exact role that correctional facilities play in enhancing COVID-19 spread and enabling community re-emergence of COVID-19 is unknown. We constructed a novel stochastic model of COVID-19 transmission to estimate the impact of correctional facilities, specifically jails and state prisons, for enhancing disease transmission and enabling disease re-emergence in local communities. Using our model, we evaluated scenarios of testing and quarantining infected incarcerated people at 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 times the rate that occurs for infected people in the local community for population sizes of 5, 10, and 20 thousand people. Our results illustrate testing and quarantining an incarcerated population of 800 would reduce the probability of a major community outbreak by 6% and also prevent between 250 to 730 incidences of COVID-19 per year, depending on local community size. These findings illustrate that managing COVID-19 in correctional facilities is essential to mitigate risks to community health, and thereby stresses the importance of improving the health standards of incarcerated people.",Scott Greenhalgh; Ashley Provencher,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251174,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251174,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
359,Modeling the Effect of Population-Wide Vaccination on the Evolution of COVID-19 Epidemic in Canada,"Population-wide vaccination is critical for containing the COVID-19 pandemic when combined with effective testing and prevention measures. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, several companies worked tirelessly for the development of an efficient vaccine that would put an end to this pandemic. Today, a number of COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use by a number of national regulatory organizations. Vaccination campaigns have already started in several countries with different daily-vaccination rates depending on the countrys vaccination capacity. Therefore, we find it timely and extremely important to conduct a study on the effect of population-wide vaccination campaigns on the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. To this end, we propose a new deterministic mathematical model to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic evolution under the effect of vaccination and vaccine efficacy. This model, referred to as SIRV, consists of a compartmental SIR (susceptible, infectious and removed) model augmented with an additional state V representing the effectively vaccinated population as well as two inputs representing the daily-vaccination rate and the vaccine efficacy. Using our SIRV model, we predict the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada and its most affected provinces (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba), for different daily vaccination rates and vaccine efficacy. Projections suggest that, without vaccination, 219, 000 lives could be lost across Canada by the end of 2021 due to COVID-19. The ongoing vaccination campaign across Canada seems to unfold relatively slowly at an average daily rate close to 1/2 vaccine per 1, 000 population. At this pace, we could be saving more than 77, 496 lives by the end of the year. Doubling the current vaccination efforts (1 vaccine per day per 1, 000 population) could be sufficient to save 125, 839 lives in Canada during the current year 2021. We would like to point out that our study assumes that the vaccine is perfectly safe without any short or long term side-effects. This study has been conducted independently at arms length from vaccine manufacturers, using the available data from Canada health services. This study can be easily adapted to other places in the world.",Intissar Harizi; Soulaimane Berkane; Abdelhamid Tayebi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250572,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250572,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
360,Engagement with COVID-19 Public Health Measures in the United States: A Cross-Sectional Social Media Analysis from June to November 2020,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to spread in the US and globally. Closely monitoring public engagement and perception of COVID-19 and preventive measures using social media data could provide important information for understanding the progress of current interventions and planning future programs.

ObjectiveTo measure the publics behaviors and perceptions regarding COVID-19 and its daily life effects during the recent 5 months of the pandemic.

MethodsNatural language processing (NLP) algorithms were used to identify COVID-19 related and unrelated topics in over 300 million online data sources from June 15 to November 15, 2020. Posts in the sample were geotagged, and sensitivity and specificity were both calculated to validate the classification of posts. The prevalence of discussion regarding these topics was measured over this time period and compared to daily case rates in the US.

ResultsThe final sample size included 9,065,733 posts, 70% of which were sourced from the US. In October and November, discussion including mentions of COVID-19 and related health behaviors did not increase as it had from June to September, despite an increase in COVID-19 daily cases in the US beginning in October. Additionally, counter to reports from March and April, discussion was more focused on daily life topics (69%), compared with COVID-19 in general (37%) and COVID-19 public health measures (20%).

ConclusionsThere was a decline in COVID-19-related social media discussion sourced mainly from the US, even as COVID-19 cases in the US have increased to the highest rate since the beginning of the pandemic. Targeted public health messaging may be needed to ensure engagement in public health prevention measures until a vaccine is widely available to the public.",Daisy Massey; Yuan Lu; Chenxi Huang; Alina Cohen; Yahel Oren; Tali Moed; Pini Matzner; Shiwani Mahajan; Cesar Caraballo; Navin Kumar; Yuchen Xue; Qinglan Ding; Rachel P Dreyer; Brita Roy; Harlan Krumholz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250127,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21250127,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
361,Antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection and boosted by vaccination neutralize an emerging variant and SARS-CoV-1,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants raises concerns about their resistance to neutralizing antibodies elicited from previous infection, or from vaccination. Here we examined whether sera and monoclonal antibodies from convalescent donors, prior to and following a single immunization with the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines, neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain and a variant, B.1.351 from South Africa. Pre-vaccination sera weakly neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351. Immunization with either vaccine generated anamnestic B and CD4+ T cell responses and a 1000-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titers against both strains and SARS-CoV-1. Neutralization was likely due to anti-RBD and anti-S2 antibodies. Our study highlights the importance of vaccination of both uninfected and of previously infected subjects, as the elicited immune response will neutralize distinct viral strains.",Leonidas Stamatatos; Julie Czartoski; Yu-Hsin Wan; Leah Homad; Vanessa Rubin; Hayley Glantz; Moni Neradilek; Emilie Seydoux; Madeleine F.

362,Immune cell residency in the nasal mucosa and COVID-19 severity across the age range,"Severe coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) positively correlates with age (Centers for Disease Control), develops after progression of infection from the upper airway to the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and can worsen into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Shi et al., 2020). Why children seem to be less likely to develop severe disease remains unclear. As the nasal mucosa (NM) is the first site of contact and defense for respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 before dissemination to the LRT (Casadei and Salinas, 2019), we hypothesized that differences in this tissue across the age range may help explain the disparity in COVID-19 severity. To this end, we profiled NM samples across the lifespan in health and disease. We find that global transcriptomic changes including the expression of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors are not correlated with age or the novel virus type, since pediatric NM cells mount similar antiviral response to both SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza B. Rather, we find immune cell residency in NM decreases dramatically with age especially cells of the innate immune system. This includes a resident-memory-like T cell subset with antiviral properties. These observations give plausible biological explanation to the observed clinical differences in disease spectrum and provide a foundation for future experimental studies.",Konner Winkley; Dithi Banerjee; Daniel Louiselle; Rebecca Biswell; Nyshele Posey; Kelly Fatheree; Stephanie McDanel; Todd Bradley; Mary E.

363,Emergence of an early SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the United States,"The emergence of the early COVID-19 epidemic in the United States (U.S.) went largely undetected, due to a lack of adequate testing and mitigation efforts. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana experienced one of the earliest and fastest accelerating outbreaks, coinciding with the annual Mardi Gras festival, which went ahead without precautions. To gain insight into the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and how large, crowded events may have accelerated early transmission, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Louisiana. We show that SARS-CoV-2 in Louisiana initially had limited sequence diversity compared to other U.S. states, and that one successful introduction of SARS-CoV-2 led to almost all of the early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Louisiana. By analyzing mobility and genomic data, we show that SARS-CoV-2 was already present in New Orleans before Mardi Gras and that the festival dramatically accelerated transmission, eventually leading to secondary localized COVID-19 epidemics throughout the Southern U.S.. Our study provides an understanding of how superspreading during large-scale events played a key role during the early outbreak in the U.S. and can greatly accelerate COVID-19 epidemics on a local and regional scale.",Mark Zeller; Karthik Gangavarapu; Catelyn Anderson; Allison R.

364,Risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 among teachers compared to healthcare workers and other working-age adults. A nationwide case-control study,"ObjectiveTo determine the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 among teachers and their household members, overall and compared to healthcare workers and the general working-age population.

DesignPopulation-based nested case-control study.

SettingsScotland, March 2020 to January 2021. Before and after schools re-opened in early August 2020.

ParticipantsAll cases of COVID-19 in Scotland in adults ages 21 to 65 (n = 83,817) and a random sample of controls matched on age, sex and general practice (n = 841,708).

ExposureIndividuals identified as actively teaching in a Scottish school by the General Teaching Council for Scotland, and household members of such individuals identified via the Unique Property Reference Number.

ComparatorIndividuals identified as healthcare workers in Scotland, their household members, and the remaining ""general population"" of working-age adults.

Main outcomesThe primary outcome was hospitalisation with COVID-19 defined in anyone testing positive with COVID-19 in hospital, admitted to hospital within 28 days of a positive test, and/or diagnosed with COVID-19 on discharge from hospital. Severe COVID-19 was defined as individuals admitted to intensive care or dying within 28 days of a positive test or assigned COVID-19 as a cause of death.

ResultsMost teachers were young (mean age 42), female (80%) and had no underlying conditions (84%). The cumulative incidence (risk) of hospitalisation with COVID-19 was below 1% for all of the working age adults. In the period after school re-opening, compared to the general population, in conditional logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, general practice, deprivation, underlying conditions and number of adults in the household, the relative risk in teachers (among 18,479 cases and controls) for hospitalisation was rate ratio (RR) 0.97 (95%CI 0.72-1.29) and for severe COVID-19 was RR 0.27 (95%CI 0.09-0.77). Equivalent rate ratios for household members of teachers were 0.97 (95%CI 0.74-1.27) and 0.67 (95%CI 0.36-1.24), and for healthcare workers were 1.82 (95%CI 1.55-2.14) and 1.76 (95%CI 1.22-2.56), respectively.

ConclusionCompared to working-age adults who are otherwise similar, teachers and their household members are not at increased risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 and are at lower risk of severe COVID-19.

365,"Estimated SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Children and Adolescents in Mississippi, May Through September 2020","Case-based tracking of COVID-19 in children and adolescents may underestimate infection, and compared with adults there is little pediatric SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data. To assess evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections among children and adolescents in Mississippi, serologic testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was conducted on a convenience sample of residual serum specimens collected for routine laboratory testing by an academic medical center laboratory during May 17 through September 19, 2020. Seroprevalence by calendar month was standardized to the state population by race/ethnicity; cumulative numbers of infections were estimated by extrapolating seroprevalence to all those aged <18 years in Mississippi. Serum specimens from 1,603 individuals were tested; 175 (10.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 1,579 (98.5%) individuals for whom race/ethnicity was known, the number testing positive was 16 (23.2%) of 69 Hispanic individuals, 117 (13.0%) of 901 non-Hispanic Black individuals and 30 (5.3%) of 565 non-Hispanic White individuals. Population-weighted seroprevalence estimates among those aged <18 years increased from 2.6% in May to 16.9% in September 2020. Cumulative numbers of infections extrapolated from seroprevalence data, however, were estimated at 117,805 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 68,771-168,708), suggesting that cases in children and adolescents are much higher than what was reported to the Mississippi State Department of Health (9,044 cases during this period).

366,Estimation of real-infection and immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in Indian populations,"Infection born by Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has swept the world within a time of a few months. It has created a devastating effect on humanity with social and economic depressions. Europe and America were the hardest hit continents. India has also lost several lives, making the country fourth most deadly worldwide. However, the infection and death rate per million and the case fatality ratio in India were substantially lower than many of the developed nations. Several factors have been proposed including the genetics. One of the important facts is that a large chunk of Indian population is asymptomatic to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the real infection in India is much higher than the reported number of cases. Therefore, the majority of people are already immune in the country. To understand the dynamics of real infection as well as level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, we have performed antibody testing (serosurveillance) in the urban region of fourteen Indian districts encompassing six states. In our survey, the seroprevalence frequency varied between 0.01-0.48, suggesting high variability of viral transmission among states. We also found out that the cases reported by the Government were several fold lower than the real infection. This discrepancy is majorly driven by a higher number of asymptomatic cases. Overall, we suggest that with the high level of immunity developed against SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of the districts, it is less likely to have a second wave in India.",Prajjval Pratap Singh; Rakesh Tamang; Manoj Shukla; Abhishek Pathak; Anshika Srivastava; Pranav Gupta; Alay Bhatt; Abhishek K.

367,"COVID-19 increases age- and sex-controlled 21-day fatality rates for patients with melanoma, hematologic malignancies, uterine cancer, or kidney cancer","IntroductionPrior research has reported an increased risk of fatality for cancer patients, but most studies investigated the risk by comparing cancer patients to non-cancer patients among COVID-19 infections. Only a few studies have compared the impact of a COVID-19 infection to non-infection with matched cancer patients and types.

Methods & MaterialsWe conducted survival analyses of 4,606 cancer patients with COVID-19 test results from March 16 to October 11, 2020 in UK Biobank and estimated the overall hazard ratio of fatality with and without COVID-19 infection. We also examined the hazard ratios of thirteen specific cancer types with at least 100 patients.

ResultsCOVID-19 resulted in an overall hazard ratio of 7.76 (95% CI: [5.78, 10.40], p<10-10) by studying the survival rate of 4,606 cancer patients for 21-days after the tests. The hazard ratio was shown to vary among cancer type, with over a 10-fold increase in fatality rate (false discovery rate[&le;]0.02) for melanoma, hematologic malignancies, uterine cancer, and kidney cancer using a stratified analysis on each of the cancer types. Although COVID-19 imposed a higher risk for localized cancers compared to distant metastasis ones, those of distant metastasis yielded higher fatality rates due to their multiplicative effects.

ConclusionThe results highlight the importance of timely care for localized and hematological cancer patients and the necessity to vaccinate uninfected patients as soon as possible, particularly for the cancer types influenced most by COVID-19.",Haiquan Li; Edwin Alexander Baldwin; Xiang Zhang; Colleen Kenost; Wenting Luo; Elizabeth A Calhoun; Lingling An; Charles L Bennett; Yves A Lussier,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.21251099,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.21251099,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True

More than 10 million confirmed cases have been reported worldwide until now. Due to the growing number of confirmed cases, timely and accurate classification of healthy and infected patients is essential to control and treat COVID-19. To this end, in this paper, we aim to develop a deep learning-based system for the persuasive classification and reliable detection of COVID-19 using chest radiography. Firstly, we evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proposed over recent years for medical image classification. Secondly, we develop and train CNN from scratch. In both cases, we use a recently published public X-Ray dataset for training and validation purposes. For transfer learning, we obtain 100% accuracy for binary classification (i.e., Normal/COVID-19) and 87.50% accuracy for tertiary classification (Normal/COVID-19/Pneumonia). With the CNN trained from scratch, we achieve 93.75% accuracy for tertiary classification. We observe, in the case of transfer learning, the classification accuracy drops with an increased number of classes.

370,Clinical and Economic Impact of Widespread Rapid Testing to Decrease SARS-CoV-2 Transmission,"BackgroundThe value of frequent, rapid testing to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo define performance standards and predict the clinical, epidemiological, and economic outcomes of nationwide, home-based, antigen testing.

DesignA simple compartmental epidemic model estimated viral transmission, clinical history, and resource use, with and without testing.

Data SourcesParameter values and ranges informed by Centers for Disease Control guidance and published literature.

Target PopulationUnited States population.

Time Horizon60 days.

PerspectiveSocietal.Costs include: testing, inpatient care, and lost workdays.

InterventionHome-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing.

Outcome MeasuresCumulative infections and deaths, numbers isolated and/or hospitalized, and total costs.

Results of Base-Case AnalysisWithout a testing intervention, the model anticipates 15 million infections, 125,000 deaths, and $10.4 billion in costs ($6.5 billion inpatient; $3.9 billion lost productivity) over a 60-day horizon. Weekly availability of testing may avert 4 million infections and 19,000 deaths, raising costs by $21.5 billion. Lower inpatient outlays ($5.9 billion) would partially offset additional testing expenditures ($12.0 billion) and workdays lost ($13.9 billion), yielding incremental costs per infection (death) averted of $5,400 ($1,100,000).

Results of Sensitivity AnalysisOutcome estimates vary widely under different behavioral assumptions and testing frequencies. However, key findings persist across all scenarios: large reductions in infections, mortality, and hospitalizations; and costs per death averted roughly an order of magnitude lower than commonly accepted willingness-to-pay values per statistical life saved ($5-17 million).

LimitationsAnalysis restricted to at-home testing and limited by uncertainties about test performance.

ConclusionHigh-frequency home testing for SARS-CoV-2 using an inexpensive, imperfect test could contribute to pandemic control at justifiable cost and warrants consideration as part of a national containment strategy.

374,Assessment & mitigation of O2 therapy driven spread of COVID-19,"BACKGROUNDExhalation exposure from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs), while using a nasal cannula or simple O2 mask used in treating COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, is a present and future risk. Little is known on exhalation dispersal through these devices, and on mitigating the viral exposure to those in the vicinity.

METHODSRespiration through O2 therapy devices was studied with a supine manikin equipped with a controllable mechanical lung by measuring aerosol density and flow with direct imaging. Dispersal direction and distances were quantified while placing a surgical mask loosely over the devices and contrasted with unmitigated oxygenation device use. Exhalation jets were examined over the entire range of oxygenation rates used in treatment.

RESULTSExhalation jets travel 0.35 {+/-} 0.02 m upward while wearing a nasal cannula, and 0.29 {+/-} 0.02 m laterally while wearing a simple O2 mask posing significant inhalation risk. Placing a surgical facemask loosely over the oxygenation device is demonstrated to alleviate exposure by reducing and deflecting the exhalation jets from being launched forward, and by reducing exhalations from being launched directly higher over a supine patient. Less than 12% of the exhaled breath is observed to reach above a masked face where HCWs would be present, independent of oxygen flow rates.

375,Chronic COVID-19 Syndrome and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) following the first pandemic wave in Germany: a first analysis of a prospective observational study,"ObjectiveCharacterization of the clinical features of patients with persistent symptoms after mild to moderate COVID-19 infection and exploration of factors associated with the development of Chronic COVID-19 Syndrome (CCS).

MethodsSetting: Charite Fatigue Center with clinical immunologists and rheumatologist, neurologists and cardiologists at Charite University hospital.

Participants: 42 patients who presented with persistent moderate to severe fatigue six months following a mostly mild SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Charite Fatigue Center from July to November 2020.

Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were clinical and paraclinical data and meeting diagnostic criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant neurological and cardiopulmonary morbidity was excluded.

ResultsThe median age was 36.5, range 22-62, 29 patients were female and 13 male. At six months post acute COVID-19 all patients had fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Score median 25 of 33, range 14-32), the most frequent other symptoms were post exertional malaise (n=41), cognitive symptoms (n=40), headache (n=38), and muscle pain (n=35). Most patients were moderately to severely impaired in daily live with a median Bell disability score of 50 (range 15-90) of 100 (healthy) and Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical function score of 63 (range 15-80) of 100. 19 of 42 patients fulfilled the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). These patients reported more fatigue in the Chalder Fatigue Score (p=0.006), more stress intolerance (p=0.042) and more frequent and longer post exertional malaise (PEM) (p=0.003), and hypersensitivity to noise (p=0.029), light (p=0.0143) and temperature (p=0.024) compared to patients not meeting ME/CFS criteria. Handgrip force was diminished in most patients compared to healthy control values, and lower in CCS/CFS compared to non-CFS CCS (Fmax1 p=0.085, Fmax2, p=0.050, Fmean1 p=0.043, Fmean2 p=0.034, mean of 10 repeat handgrips, 29 female patients). Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency was observed frequently (22% of all patients) and elevated IL-8 levels were found in 43% of patients.

376,Dynamics of neutralizing antibody responses in acute-phase COVID-19: A potential relationship between disease progression and rapid neutralizing antibody response,"IntroductionAdaptive immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dynamics remain largely unknown. The neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are helpful for understanding the pathology.

Patients and MethodsUsing SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, serum sample neutralization values in symptomatic COVID-19 patients were measured using the chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT). At least two sequential serum samples collected during hospitalization were analyzed to assess NAbs neutralizing activity dynamics at different time points.

ResultsOf the 11 patients, four (36.4%), six (54.5%), and one (9.1%) had moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Fifty percent neutralization (N50%-CRNT) was observed upon admission in 90.9% (10/11); all patients acquired neutralizing activity 2-12 days after onset. In patients with moderate disease, neutralization was observed at earliest within two days after symptom onset. In patients with severe-to-critical disease, neutralization activity increased, plateauing 9-16 days after onset. Neutralization activity on admission was significantly higher in patients with moderate disease than in patients with severe-to-critical disease (relative % of infectivity, 6.4% vs. 41.1%; P=.0011).

ConclusionsNeutralization activity on admission inversely correlated with disease severity.

377,The impact of mobility network properties on predicted epidemic dynamics in Dhaka and Bangkok,"1Properties of city-level commuting networks are expected to influence epidemic potential of cities and modify the speed and spatial trajectory of epidemics when they occur. In this study, we use aggregated mobile phone user data to reconstruct commuter mobility networks for Bangkok (Thailand) and Dhaka (Bangladesh), two megacities in Asia with populations of 16 and 21 million people, respectively. We model the dynamics of directly-transmitted infections (such as SARS-CoV2) propagating on these commuting networks, and find that differences in network structure between the two cities drive divergent predicted epidemic trajectories: the commuting network in Bangkok is composed of geographically-contiguous modular communities and epidemic dispersal is correlated with geographic distance between locations, whereas the network in Dhaka has less distinct geographic structure and epidemic dispersal is less constrained by geographic distance. We also find that the predicted dynamics of epidemics vary depending on the local topology of the network around the origin of the outbreak. Measuring commuter mobility, and understanding how commuting networks shape epidemic dynamics at the city level, can support surveillance and preparedness efforts in large cities at risk for emerging or imported epidemics.",Tyler S Brown; Kenth Engø-Monsen; Mathew V Kiang; Ayesha S Mahmud; Richard J Maude; Caroline O Buckee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21250586,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.07.21250586,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,,True
378,"COVIDHunter: An Accurate, Flexible, and Environment-Aware Open-Source COVID-19 Outbreak Simulation Model","MotivationEarly detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential for successful implementation of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing the disease spread. With a limited number of daily COVID-19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation measures.

ResultsUsing Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the policy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days to prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average of 23.8 x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.

380,Pre-pandemic cognitive function and COVID-19 mortality: prospective cohort study,"BackgroundPoorer performance on standard tests of cognitive function is related to an elevated risk of death from lower respiratory tract infections. Whether pre-pandemic measures of cognition are related to COVID-19 mortality is untested.

MethodsUK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when a reaction time test was administered to the full sample, and verbal-numeric reasoning assessed in a subgroup. Death from COVID-19 was ascertained from participant linkage to a UK-wide national registry.

ResultsBetween April 1st and September 23rd 2020, there were 388 deaths (138 women) ascribed to COVID-19 in the 494,932 individuals (269,602 women) with a reaction time test result, and 125 such deaths (38 women) in the 180,198 (97,794 women) for whom there were data on verbal-numeric reasoning. In analyses adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity, a one standard deviation (118.2 msec) slower reaction time was related to a higher rate of death from COVID-19 (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval: 1.18; 1.09, 1.28). A one standard deviation disadvantage (2.16 point) on the verbal-numeric reasoning test was also associated with an elevated risk of death (1.32; 1.09, 1.59). Attenuation after adjustment for additional covariates followed a similar pattern for both measures of cognition. For verbal-numeric reasoning, for instance, the hazard ratios were 1.22 (0.98, 1.51) after control for socioeconomic status, 1.16 (0.96, 1.41) after lifestyle factors, 1.25 (1.04, 1.52) after co-morbidity, and 1.29 (1.01, 1.64) after physiological indices.

381,Social predictors of food insecurity during the stay-at-home order due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Results from a cross-sectional web-based survey,"BackgroundStay-at-home orders and social distancing have been implemented as the primary tool to reduce the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, this approach has indirectly caused, only in Lima-Peru, more than 2{middle dot}3 million Peruvians to lose their jobs. As a result, the risk of food insecurity may have increased in affected low-income families, especially those that depend on daily income. This study estimates the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity (MSFI) and identifies the associated factors that explain this outcome during the stay-at-home order.

MethodsA cross-sectional web-based survey, with the non-probability sample, was conducted between May 18 and June 30, 2020, during the stay-at-home order in Peru. We used social media advertisements on Facebook to reach 18-59 year-olds living in Peru. MSFI was assessed using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Rasch model methodology requirements were considered, and factors associated with MSFI were selected using a stepwise forward selection. A Poisson generalized linear model (Poisson GLMs), with log link function, was employed to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR).

FindingsThis analysis is based on 1846 replies. The prevalence of MSFI was 23{middle dot}2%, and FIES proved to be an acceptable instrument with reliability 0{middle dot}72 and infit 0{middle dot}8-1{middle dot}3. People more likely to experience MSFI were those with low income (less than 255 US$/month) in the pre-pandemic period (aPR 3{middle dot}77; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}98-7{middle dot}16), those whose income was significantly reduced during the pandemic period (aPR 2{middle dot}27; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}55-3{middle dot}31), and those whose savings ran out in less than 21 days (aPR 1{middle dot}86; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}43-2{middle dot}42). Likewise, heads of households (aPR 1{middle dot}20; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}00-1{middle dot}44) and those with relatives with probable SARS-CoV2 cases (aPR 1{middle dot}29; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}05-1{middle dot}58) were at an increased risk of MSFI. Additionally, those who perceived losing weight during the pandemic (aPR 1{middle dot}21; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}01-1{middle dot}45), and reported increases in processed foods prices (aPR 1{middle dot}31; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}08-1{middle dot}59), and eating less minimally processed food (aPR 1{middle dot}82; 95%CI, 1{middle dot}48-2{middle dot}24) were also more likely to experience MSFI.

InterpretationPeople most at risk of MSFI were those in a critical economic situation before and during the pandemic period. It is necessary to reinforce social protection policies to prevent or mitigate these adverse effects.

The molecular mechanisms causing COVID-19-induced ARDS have yet to be defined, though many studies have documented an increase in cytokines known as a ""cytokine storm."" Here, we demonstrate that cytokines that activate the NF-kappaB pathway can induce Activin A and its downstream marker, FLRG. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients elevated Activin A/FLRG at baseline were predictive of the most severe longitudinal outcomes of COVID-19, including the need for mechanical ventilation, lack of clinical improvement and all-cause mortality. Patients with Activin A/FLRG above the sample median were 2.6/2.9 times more likely to die, relative to patients with levels below the sample median, respectively.

385,Neural epidermal growth factor-like 1 protein variant increases survival and modulates the inflammatory and immune responses in human ACE-2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is a worsening global pandemic. COVID-19 has caused at least 1.7 million deaths worldwide and over 300,000 in the United States. Recently, two promising vaccines are being administered in several countries. However, there remains an urgent need for a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory damage that can lead to intensive care, prolonged hospitalization, or mortality. Moreover, an increasing population of patients manifest lingering disabling symptoms (called Long Haulers). Here, we tested the efficacy of a recombinant neural epidermal growth factor like 1 protein variant (NELL1-NV1) in a COVID-19 mouse model, transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (tg-mice hACE2) infected with SARS-CoV-2. The administration of NELL1-NV1 to SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 significantly improved clinical health score and increased survival. Analyses of bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid demonstrated decreased levels of several cytokines and chemokines (IFN-{gamma}, IL-10, IL-12 p70, CXCL-10/IP-10, MIG and Rantes), in NV1-treated treated mice compared to controls.

386,Genomic epidemiology identifies emergence and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 in the United States,"As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021.

387,"Neutralization of viruses with European, South African, and United States SARS-CoV-2 variant spike proteins by convalescent sera and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies","The increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein has raised concerns that recovered individuals may not be protected from reinfection and that current vaccines will become less effective. The B.1.1.7 isolate identified in the United Kingdom and B.1.351 isolate identified in the Republic of South Africa encode spike proteins with multiple mutations in the S1 and S2 subunits. In addition, variants have been identified in Columbus, Ohio (COH.20G/677H), Europe (20A.EU2) and in domesticated minks. Analysis by antibody neutralization of pseudotyped viruses showed that convalescent sera from patients infected prior to the emergence of the variant viruses neutralized viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, COH.20G/677H Columbus Ohio, 20A.EU2 Europe and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor decrease in titer compared to that of the earlier D614G spike protein. Serum specimens from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine neutralized D614G virus with titers that were on average 7-fold greater than convalescent sera. Vaccine elicited antibodies neutralized virus with the B.1.1.7 spike protein with titers similar to D614G virus and neutralized virus with the B.1.351 spike with, on average, a 3-fold reduction in titer (1:500), a titer that was still higher than the average titer with which convalescent sera neutralized D614G (1:139). The reduction in titer was attributable to the E484K mutation in the RBD. The B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses were not more infectious than D614G on ACE2.293T cells in vitro but N501Y, an ACE2 contacting residue present in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and COH.20G/677H spike proteins caused higher affinity binding to ACE2, likely contributing to their increased transmissibility. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by primary infection and by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine are likely to maintain protective efficacy against B.1.1.7 and most other variants but that the partial resistance of virus with the B.1.351 spike protein could render some individuals less well protected, supporting a rationale for the development of modified vaccines containing E484K.",Takuya Tada; Belinda M Dcosta; Marie Samanovic-Golden; Ramin S Herati; Amber Cornelius; Mark J Mulligan; Nathaniel R Landau,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.430003,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.430003,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False

Our lead antibody JMB2002, now in a phase I clinical trial, showed broad-spectrum in vitro blocking activity against hACE2 binding to the RBD of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants including B.1.351 that was reportedly much more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma, vaccine sera and some clinical stage neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, JMB2002 has demonstrated complete prophylactic and potent therapeutic efficacy in a rhesus macaque disease model.

389,Human immunoglobulin from transchromosomic bovines hyperimmunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen efficiently neutralizes viral variants.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with amino-acid substitutions and deletions in spike protein (S) can reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may compromise immunity induced by vaccines. We report a polyclonal, fully human, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin produced in transchromosomic bovines (Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2) hyperimmunized with two doses of plasmid DNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain S gene, followed by repeated immunization with S protein purified from insect cells. The resulting Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2, termed SAB-185, efficiently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) SARS-CoV-2 chimeras in vitro. Neutralization potency was retained for S variants including S477N, E484K, and N501Y, substitutions present in recent variants of concern. In contrast to the ease of selection of escape variants with mAbs and convalescent human plasma, we were unable to isolate VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutants resistant to Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. This fully human immunoglobulin that potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide an effective therapeutic to combat COVID-19.",Zhuoming Liu; Hua Wu; Kristi A. Egland; Theron C.

390,Targeting CTP Synthetase 1 to Restore Interferon Induction and Impede Nucleotide Synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic with astonishing mortality and morbidity. The mechanisms underpinning its highly infectious nature remain poorly understood. We report here that SARS-CoV-2 exploits cellular CTP synthetase 1 (CTPS1) to promote CTP synthesis and suppress interferon (IFN) induction. Screening a SARS-CoV-2 expression library identified ORF7b and ORF8 that suppressed IFN induction via inducing the deamidation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Deamidated IRF3 fails to bind the promoters of classic IRF3-responsible genes, thus muting IFN induction. Conversely, a shRNA-mediated screen focused on cellular glutamine amidotransferases corroborated that CTPS1 deamidates IRF3 to inhibit IFN induction. Functionally, ORF7b and ORF8 activate CTPS1 to promote de novo CTP synthesis while shutting down IFN induction. De novo synthesis of small-molecule inhibitors of CTPS1 enabled CTP depletion and IFN induction in SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus impeding SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our work uncovers a strategy that a viral pathogen couples immune evasion to metabolic activation to fuel viral replication. Inhibition of the cellular CTPS1 offers an attractive means for developing antiviral therapy that would be resistant to SARS-CoV-2 mutation.",Youliang Rao; Ting-Yu Wang; Chao Qin; Bianca Espinosa; Qizhi Liu; Arunika Ekanayake; Jun Zhao; Ali Can Savas; Shu Zhang; Mehrnaz Zarinfar; Yongzhen Liu; Wenjie Zhu; Nicholas Alexander Graham; Taijiao Jiang; Chao Zhang; Pinghui Feng,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429959,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429959,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False
391,The local topological free energy of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells using a mechanism that involves binding and structural rearrangement of its spike protein. Understanding protein rearrangement and identifying specific residues where mutations affect protein rearrangement has attracted a lot of attention for drug development. We use a mathematical method introduced in [9] to associate a local topological/geometrical free energy along the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein backbone. Our results show that the total local topological free energy of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monotonically decreases from pre-to post-fusion and that its distribution along the protein domains is related to their activity in protein rearrangement. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with inclusion of solvent effects, we show that high local topological free energy conformations are unstable compared to those of low topological free energy. By comparing to experimental data, we find that the high local topological free energy conformations in the spike protein are associated with mutations which have the largest experimentally observed effect to protein rearrangement.",Quenisha Baldwin; Bobby G Sumpter; Eleni Panagiotou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430094,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430094,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False
392,Insights on SARS-CoV-2's Mutations for Evading Human Antibodies: Sacrifice and Survival,"Recent mutations on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2s spike protein have been manifested as the major cause of the wide and rapid spread of the virus. Especially, the variant B.1.351 in South Africa with the hallmark of triple mutations (N501Y, K417N and E484K) is worrisome. Quickly after the outbreak of this new variant, several studies showed that both N501Y and E484K can enhance the binding between RBD and the human ACE2 receptor. However, the mutation K417N seems to be unfavorable because it removes one interfacial salt-bridge. So far, it is still not well understood why the K417N mutation is selected in the viral evolution. Here, we show that despite the loss in the binding affinity (1.48 kcal/mol) between RBD and ACE2 the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt-bridge between RBD and the neutralizing antibody CB6 and thus substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal/mol, facilitating the variants to efficiently elude CB6 (as well as many other antibodies). Thus, when proliferating from person to person the virus might have adapted to the human immune system through evasive mutations. Taking into account limited and relevant experimental works in the field, we show that our theoretical predictions are consistent with existing experimental findings. By harnessing the revealed molecular mechanism for variants, it becomes feasible to redesign therapeutic antibodies accordingly to make them more efficacious.

393,Self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccines targeting the S protein induces protective immunity in mice,"The spike (S), a homotrimer glycoprotein, is the most important antigen target in the research and development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. There is no doubt that fully simulating the advanced structure of this homotrimer in the subunit vaccine development strategy is the most likely way to improve the immune protective effect of the vaccine. In this study, the preparation strategies of S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) trimer, S1 region trimer, and ectodomain (ECD) trimer nanoparticles were designed based on ferritin nanoparticle self-assembly technology. The Bombyx mori baculovirus expression system was used to prepare these three nanoparticle vaccines with high expression levels in the silkworm. The immune results of mice show that the nanoparticle vaccine prepared by this strategy can not only induce an immune response by subcutaneous administration but also effective by oral administration. Given the stability of these ferritin-based nanoparticles vaccine, easy-to-use and low-cost oral immunization strategy can make up for the vaccination blind areas caused by the shortage of ultralow-temperature equipment and medical resources in underdeveloped areas. And the oral vaccine is also a very potential candidate to cut off the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic and farmed animals, especially in stray and wild animals.",Xingjian Liu; Haozhi Song; Jianmin Jiang; Xintao Gao; Yongzhu Yi; Yuting Shang; Jialei Li; Dan Li; Zhen Zeng; Yinu Li; Zhifang Zhang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.428685,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.428685,2021-02-07,2021-02-07,,False
394,"Assessing knowledge, concerns, and risk perceptions among Italian medical students during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","INTRODUCTIONDuring the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic, Italian medical students transitioned from in-person to remote learning. This study was carried out to early assess students sources of information, perceived risk of infection, knowledge and preventive practices in order to resume academic activity. The impact of training and volunteer work was also assessed.

METHODSA cross-sectional online survey was conducted in May 2020 among medical students enrolled in the School of Medicine and Surgery, Bologna University.

RESULTSThe analysis included 537 responses. On average students used seven sources of information on COVID-19. Scientific journals were considered the most trustworthy but they ranked only 6th in the frequency of use. Perceived risk of infection was higher for academic activities, especially in the hospital than daily living activities. Less than 50% of students reported being trained on biological risk and use of PPE. Training received was significantly associated with both perceived risk of infection and confidence in the use of PPE. Students engaged in volunteer work had higher confidence in PPE usage.

DISCUSSIONAccessible scientific information and students engagement in spreading correct knowledge play an important role in challenging misinformation during the pandemic crisis. Students showed suboptimal knowledge about PPE use, calling for additional training. We found a moderate-high perceived risk of infection that could be mitigated with specific educational programs and by promoting voluntary work. Students engagement in public health emergencies (PHE) could potentially be beneficial for their training and as well as for the healthcare system.",Manfredi Greco; Elisa Maietti; Elena Savoia; Davide Trere; Chiara Reno; Flavia Rallo; Maria Pia Fantini; DAVIDE GORI,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250922,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,True
395,"Was R<1 before the English lockdowns? On modelling mechanistic detail, causality and inference about Covid-19","Detail is a double edged sword in epidemiological modelling. The inclusion of mechanistic detail in models of highly complex systems has the potential to increase realism, but it also increases the number of modelling assumptions, which become harder to check as their possible interactions multiply. Knock et al. (2020) fit an age structured SEIR model with added health service compartments to data on deaths, hospitalization and test results from Covid-19 in seven English regions for the period March to December 2020. The simplest version of the model has 684 states per region. One main conclusion is that only full lockdowns brought the pathogen reproduction number, R, below one, with R >> 1 in all regions on the eve of March 2020 lockdown. We critically evaluate the Knock et al. epidemiological model, and the semi-causal conclusions made using it, based on an independent reimplementation of the model designed to allow relaxation of some of its strong assumptions. In particular, Knock et al. model the effect on transmission of both non-pharmaceutical interventions and weather using a piecewise linear function, b(t), with 12 breakpoints at selected government announcement or intervention dates. We replace this representation by a smoothing spline with time varying smoothness, thereby allowing the form of b(t) to be substantially more data driven. We conclude that there is no sound basis for using the Knock et al. model and their analysis to make counterfactual statements about the number of deaths that would have occurred with different lockdown timings. However, if fits of this epidemiological model structure are viewed as a reasonable basis for inference about the time course of incidence and R, then without very strong modelling assumptions, the pathogen reproduction number was probably below one, and incidence in substantial decline, some days before either of the first two English national lockdowns. Of course this does not imply that lockdowns had no effect, but it does suggest that other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were much more effective than Knock et al. imply.

396,Symptom Prediction and Mortality Risk Calculation for COVID-19 Using Machine Learning,"BackgroundEarly prediction of symptoms and mortality risks for COVID-19 patients would improve healthcare outcomes, allow for the appropriate distribution of healthcare resources, reduce healthcare costs, aid in vaccine prioritization and self-isolation strategies, and thus reduce the prevalence of the disease. Such publicly accessible prediction models are lacking, however.

MethodsBased on a comprehensive evaluation of existing machine learning (ML) methods, we created two models based solely on the age, gender, and medical histories of 23,749 hospital-confirmed COVID-19 patients from February to September 2020: a symptom prediction model (SPM) and a mortality prediction model (MPM). The SPM predicts 12 symptom groups for each patient: respiratory distress, consciousness disorders, chest pain, paresis or paralysis, cough, fever or chill, gastrointestinal symptoms, sore throat, headache, vertigo, loss of smell or taste, and muscular pain or fatigue. The MPM predicts the death of COVID-19-positive individuals.

ResultsThe SPM yielded ROC-AUCs of 0.53-0.78 for symptoms. The most accurate prediction was for consciousness disorders at a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 70%. 2440 deaths were observed in the study population. MPM had a ROC-AUC of 0.79 and could predict mortality with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 70%. About 90% of deaths occurred in the top 21 percentile of risk groups. To allow patients and clinicians to use these models easily, we created a freely accessible online interface at www.aicovid.org.

ConclusionsThe ML models predict COVID-19-related symptoms and mortality using information that is readily available to patients as well as clinicians. Thus, both can rapidly estimate the severity of the disease, allowing shared and better healthcare decisions with regard to hospitalization, self-isolation strategy, and COVID-19 vaccine prioritization in the coming months.

397,Prioritizing allocation of COVID-19 vaccines based on social contacts increases vaccination effectiveness,"We study allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to individuals based on the structural properties of their underlying social contact network. Even optimistic estimates suggest that most countries will likely take 6 to 24 months to vaccinate their citizens. These time estimates and the emergence of new viral strains urge us to find quick and effective ways to allocate the vaccines and contain the pandemic. While current approaches use combinations of age-based and occupation-based prioritizations, our strategy marks a departure from such largely aggregate vaccine allocation strategies. We propose a novel agent-based modeling approach motivated by recent advances in (i) science of real-world networks that point to efficacy of certain vaccination strategies and (ii) digital technologies that improve our ability to estimate some of these structural properties. Using a realistic representation of a social contact network for the Commonwealth of Virginia, combined with accurate surveillance data on spatio-temporal cases and currently accepted models of within- and between-host disease dynamics, we study how a limited number of vaccine doses can be strategically distributed to individuals to reduce the overall burden of the pandemic. We show that allocation of vaccines based on individuals degree (number of social contacts) and total social proximity time is significantly more effective than the currently used age-based allocation strategy in terms of number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Our results suggest that in just two months, by March 31, 2021, compared to age-based allocation, the proposed degree-based strategy can result in reducing an additional 56-110k infections, 3.2-5.4k hospitalizations, and 700-900 deaths just in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Extrapolating these results for the entire US, this strategy can lead to 3-6 million fewer infections, 181-306k fewer hospitalizations, and 51-62k fewer deaths compared to age-based allocation. The overall strategy is robust even: (i) if the social contacts are not estimated correctly; (ii) if the vaccine efficacy is lower than expected or only a single dose is given; (iii) if there is a delay in vaccine production and deployment; and (iv) whether or not non-pharmaceutical interventions continue as vaccines are deployed. For reasons of implementability, we have used degree, which is a simple structural measure and can be easily estimated using several methods, including the digital technology available today. These results are significant, especially for resource-poor countries, where vaccines are less available, have lower efficacy, and are more slowly distributed.",Jiangzhuo Chen; Stefan Hoops; Achla Marathe; Henning Mortveit; Bryan Lewis; Srinivasan Venkatramanan; Arash Haddadan; Parantapa Bhattacharya; Abhijin Adiga; Anil Vullikanti; Aravind Srinivasan; Mandy Wilson; Gal Ehrlich; Maier Fenster; Stephen Eubank; Christopher Barrett; Madhav Marathe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251012,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21251012,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,True
398,SARS-CoV-2 Worldwide Replication Drives Rapid Rise and Selection of Mutations across the Viral Genome: A Time-Course StudyPotential Challenge for Vaccines and Therapies,"Scientists and the public were alarmed at the first large viral variant of SARS-CoV2 reported in December 2020. We have followed the time course of emerging viral mutants and variants during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in ten countries on four continents. We examined complete SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences in GISAID, (Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data) with sampling dates extending until January 20, 2021. These sequences originated from ten different countries: United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, USA, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China. Among the novel mutations, some previously reported mutations waned and some of them increased in prevalence over time. VUI2012/01 (B.1.1.7) and 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), the so-called UK and South Africa variants, respectively, and two variants from Brazil, 484K.V2, now called P.1 and P.2, increased in prevalence. Despite lockdowns, worldwide active replication in genetically and socio-economically diverse populations facilitated selection of new mutations. The data on mutant and variant SARS-CoV-2 strains provided here comprise a global resource for easy access to the myriad mutations and variants detected to date globally. Rapidly evolving new variant and mutant strains might give rise to escape variants, capable of limiting the efficacy of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostic tests.

Significance and New Aspects of Study - SynopsisO_LIWe examine the time course of emerging mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have rapidly been selected in the worlds populations through the beginning of 2021. A study of the prevalence of viral mutations in the GISAID database in ten different countries - United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, US, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China - revealed widespread mutations along the genome.
C_LIO_LIWe previously identified about 10 hotspot mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that became prevalent in many of the countries studied1. Since the beginning of February, many new mutations arose in the ten countries (and worldwide). The preponderance of variants and mutations correlated with the increased spread of Covid-19.
C_LIO_LIThere was a temporal progression from about 10 predominant mutants shared by several countries up to the end of May 2020, followed by a consistent and rapid increase in the number of new mutations between June and December along with the emergence of variants of concern, first reported in December 2020.
C_LIO_LIWe examine the relative frequencies of mutations, along with variants of interest, in 10 countries up until January 20, 2021. Investigations on the pathogenic properties of individual SARS-CoV-2 mutations will be urgently needed to understand the kaleidoscopic patterns of worldwide Covid-19 outbreaks and symptoms. Monitoring the frequency and speed of mutant selection have direct relevance to diagnostic testing, vaccines and therapeutics.
C_LIO_LIAs an explanation for efficient viral mutagenesis, we hypothesize that the viral spike protein - as documented - facilitates viral entry via the cells ACE receptor2. This in turn interacts with the APOBEC polypeptide, an m-RNA editing function. The actually observed frequent C to U (T) transitions and other base exchanges are thus effected. Hence, as one of the earliest steps upon viral entry, active mutagenesis commences, since SARS-CoV-2 exploits one of the cells defenses against viral infections.

MethodsElectronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17th March 2020 - 1st May 2020) and (cohort 2: 18th May 2020 - 6th July 2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data.

ResultsCompared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to be female (p<0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were PCR positive, CXR negative (both p<0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations (p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%). Over the 2 cohorts, age [&ge;]70 (p<0.001), male gender (p<0.05), hypertension (p<0.01), heart failure (p<0.05), cognitive impairment (p<0.001), frailty (p<0.001), COPD (p<0.05), delirium (p<0.001), elevated perioperative Glasgow Prognostic Score (p[&le;]0.001), elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001), low haematocrit (p<0.01), elevated urea (p<0.001), creatinine (p<0.001), glucose (p<0.05) and lactate (p<0.01); and the 4C score were associated with 30-day mortality. When compared with the 4C score, greater frailty (OR 10.2, 95% C.I. 3.4 - 30.6, p<0.01) and low albumin (OR 5.6, 95% C.I. 2.0 - 15.6, p<0.01) were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality.

ConclusionIn addition to the 4C mortality score, frailty score and a low albumin were strongly independently associated with 30-day mortality in two consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

Article summaryO_LIIn two consecutive cohorts of patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to two urban teaching hospitals in Glasgow, UK, there were variations in a number of clinicopathological characteristics despite similar mortality (23 and 22%).

MethodsSerological testing was conducted on 708 individuals. Concordance metrics were estimated. Logistic regression was used to assess associations with seropositivity.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 63.4% (449/708; 95% CI 59.8%-66.9%) using the BioMedomics assay and 71.9% (509/708; 95% CI 68.5%-75.1%) using the Elecsys assay. There were 62 discordant results between the two assays. One specimen was seropositive in the BioMedomics assay, but seronegative in the Elecsys assay, while 61 specimens were seropositive in the Elecsys assay, but seronegative in the BioMedomics assay. Positive, negative, and overall percent agreements between the two assays were 88.0% (95% CI 84.9%-90.6%), 99.5% (95% CI 97.2%-99.9%), and 91.2% (95% CI 88.9%-93.1%), respectively, with a Cohens kappa of 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83), indicating excellent agreement. Excluding specimens with lower antibody titers, the agreement improved with positive, negative, and overall percent concordance of 91.2% (95% CI 88.2%-93.6%), 99.5% (95% CI 97.2%-99.9%), and 93.9% (95% CI 91.7%-95.5%), respectively, and a Cohens kappa of 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.89). Logistic regression confirmed better agreement with higher antibody titers.

401,"Combination therapy of Tocilizumab and steroid for management of COVID-19 associated cytokine release syndrome: A single center experience from Pune, Western India","BackgroundCytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is thought to be the cause of inflammatory lung damage, worsening pneumonia and death in patients with COVID-19. Steroids (Methylprednisolone or Dexamethasone) and Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, are approved for the treatment of CRS in India. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of TCZ and steroids in COVID-19 associated CRS.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary level private hospital in Pune, India between 2nd April and 2nd November 2020. All patients administered TCZ and steroids for treatment of CRS were included. The primary endpoint was incidence of all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes studied were need for mechanical ventilation and incidence of infectious complications. Baseline and time-dependent risk factors significantly associated with death were identified by Relative risk estimation.

ResultsOut of 2831 admitted patients, 515 (24.3% females) were administered TCZ and steroids. Median age of the cohort was 57 (IQR: 46.5, 66) years. Almost 72 % patients had preexisting co-morbidities. Median time to TCZ administration since onset of symptoms was 9 days (IQR: 7, 11). 63% patients needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Mechanical ventilation was required in 242 (47%) patients. Of these, 44.2% (107/242) recovered and were weaned off the ventilator. There were 135 deaths (26.2%), while 380 patients (73.8%) had clinical improvement. Infectious complications like hospital acquired pneumonia, bloodstream bacterial and fungal infections were observed in 2.13 %, 2.13 % and 0.06 % patients respectively. Age [&ge;] 60 years (p=0.014), presence of co-morbidities like hypertension (p = 0.011), IL-6 [&ge;] 100 pg/ml (p = 0.002), D-dimer [&ge;] 1000 ng/ml (p < 0.0001), CT severity index [&ge;] 18 (p < 0.0001) and systemic complications like lung fibrosis (p = 0.019), cardiac arrhythmia (p < 0.0001), hypotension (p < 0.0001) and encephalopathy (p < 0.0001) were associated with increased risk of death.

402,Subgenomic RNAs as molecular indicators of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,"In coronaviridae such as SARS-CoV-2, subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) are replicative intermediates, therefore, their abundance and structures could infer viral replication activity and severity of host infection. Here, we systematically characterized the sgRNA expression and their structural variation in 81 clinical specimens collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with a goal of assessing viral genomic signatures of disease severity. We demonstrated the highly coordinated and consistent expression of sgRNAs from individuals with robust infections that results in symptoms, and found their expression is significantly repressed in the asymptomatic infections, indicating that the ratio of sgRNAs to genomic RNA (sgRNA/gRNA) is highly correlated with the severity of the disease. Using long read sequencing technologies to characterize full-length sgRNA structures, we also observed widespread deletions in viral RNAs, and identified unique sets of deletions preferentially found primarily in symptomatic individuals, with many likely to confer changes in SARS-CoV-2 virulence and host responses. Furthermore, based on the sgRNA structures, the frequently occurred structural variants in SARS-CoV-2 genomes serves as a mechanism to further induce SARS-CoV-2 proteome complexity. Taken together, our results show that differential sgRNA expression and structural mutational burden both appear to be correlated with the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Longitudinally monitoring sgRNA expression and structural diversity could further guide treatment responses, testing strategies, and vaccine development.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430041,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.430041,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,,False
403,Exponential increase in neutralizing and spike specific antibodies following vaccination of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors,"BackgroundWith the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines, recovered COVID-19 subjects who are vaccinated may be ideal candidates to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP).

Case SeriesThree recovered COVID-19 patients were screened to donate CCP. All had molecularly confirmed COVID-19, and all were antibody positive by chemiluminescence immunoassay (DiaSorin) prior to vaccination. All were tested again for antibodies 11 to 21 days after they received the first dose of the vaccine (Pfizer). All showed dramatic increases ([~]50 fold) in spike-specific antibody levels and had at least a 20-fold increase in the IC50 neutralizing antibody titer based on plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT). The spike-specific antibody levels following vaccination were significantly higher than those seen in any non-vaccinated COVID-19 subjects tested to date at our facility.

ConclusionSpike-specific and neutralizing antibodies demonstrated dramatic increases following a single vaccination post COVID-19 infection which significantly exceeded values seen with COVID-19 infection alone.

404,Efficacy of Ivermectin in COVID-19 Patients with Mild to Moderate Disease,"ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin (IVM) as an addition to the standard of care (SOC) treatment in COVID-19 patients with mild and moderate disease

Materials and MethodsA randomized clinical trial (Trial registration # NCT04392713) was carried out at Combined Military Hospital Lahore from March 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Eighty-six patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) proven SARS-CoV-2 infection completed the trial protocol. Patients were stratified via the lottery method into two groups. Group A was administered standard of care (SOC) treatment as per existing hospital guidelines whereas group B was given ivermectin (single dose of 12 milligrams) along with SOC treatment. PCR was repeated at 72 hours, 7th day, and at 14th day of admission for both the groups and the point at which the PCR became negative was noted. Complete blood counts, liver function tests and renal function tests were done at recruitment, 7th day, and 14th day. The primary outcome was the viral clearance, measured as days to achieve PCR negativity. The secondary outcome was the development of any adverse side effects pertinent to ivermectin or derangement in baseline laboratory parameters.

ResultsIn group A, 36 (80%) participants were males, and 9 (20%) were females, whereas in group B, 37 (90.2%) were males and 4 (9.8%) were females. Mean age was 39.0{+/-} 12.6 and 42.2 {+/-} 12.0 years for groups A and B, respectively (p= 0.394). There was early viral clearance in group B as compared to group A (p=0.001). No adverse reaction or derangements in laboratory parameters was noted in the intervention arm during the trial period.

ConclusionIn the intervention arm, early viral clearance was observed and no side effects were documented.

406,"Could the new COVID-19 mutant strain undermine vaccination efforts? A mathematical modelling approach for estimating the spread of the UK mutant strain using Ontario, Canada, as a case study","BackgroundInfections represent highly dynamic processes, characterized by evolutionary changes and events that involve both the pathogen and the host. Among infectious agents, viruses, such as the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent responsible for the currently ongoing ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-2019) pandemic, have a particularly high mutation rate. Taking into account the mutational landscape of an infectious agent, it is important to shed light on its evolution capability over time. As new, more infectious strains of COVID-19 emerge around the world, it is imperative to estimate when these new strains may overtake the wild-type strain in different populations. Therefore, we developed a general-purpose framework to estimate the time at which a mutant variant is able to takeover a wild-type strain during an emerging infectious diseases outbreak. In this study, we used COVID-19 as a case-study, but the model is adaptable to any emerging pathogens.

Methods and findingsWe devise a two-strain mathematical framework, to model a wild- and a mutant-type viral population and fit cumulative case data to parameterize the model, using Ontario as a case study. We found that, in the context of under-reporting and the current case levels, a variant strain is unlikely to dominate until March/April 2021. Current non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario need to be kept in place longer even with vaccination in order to prevent another outbreak. The spread of a variant strain in Ontario will mostly likely be observed by a widened peak of the daily reported cases. If vaccine efficacy is maintained across strains, then it is still possible to have an immune population by end of 2021.

ConclusionsOur findings have important practical implications in terms of public health as policy-and decision-makers are equipped with a mathematical tool that can enable the estimation of the take-over of a mutant strain of an emerging infectious disease.",Matthew Betti; Nicola Bragazzi; Jane Marie Heffernan; Jude Dzevela Kong; Angie Raad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251039,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251039,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
407,Quantifying transmissibility of COVID-19 and impact of intervention within long-term health care facilities,"Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are particularly variable in the context of transmission within locations such as long-term health care (LTHC) facilities. We sought to characterise the heterogeneity of R0 across known outbreaks within these facilities. We used a unique comprehensive dataset of all outbreaks that have occurred within LTHC facilities in British Columbia, Canada. We estimated R0 with a Bayesian hierarchical dynamic model of susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals, that incorporates heterogeneity of R0 between facilities. We further compared these estimates to those obtained with standard methods that utilize the exponential growth rate and maximum likelihood. The total size of an outbreak varied dramatically, with a range of attack rates of 2%-86%. The Bayesian analysis provides more constrained overall estimates of R0 = 2.83 (90% CrI [credible interval] 0.25- 7.19) than standard methods, with a range within facilities of 0.66-10.06.

409,Estimating vaccine confidence levels among future healthcare workers and their trainers: A quantitative study protocol,"IntroductionThe outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caught the world off guard in the first quarter of the year 2020. To stem the tide of this pandemic, the development, testing, and pre-licensure approval for emergency use of some COVID 19 vaccine candidates were accelerated. This led to raised public concern about their safety and efficacy, compounding the challenges of vaccine hesitancy which was already declared one of the top ten threats to global health in the year 2019. The onus of managing and administering these vaccines to a skeptical populace when they do become available rests mostly on the shoulders of healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, the vaccine confidence levels of HCWs becomes critical to the success of vaccination endeavors, especially COVID 19 vaccination. This proposed study aims to estimate the level of vaccine confidence and the intention to receive a COVID 19 vaccine among future HCWs and their trainers at a specific university in Cape Town, South Africa, and to identify any vaccination concerns early for targeted intervention.

Methods and analysisAn online survey will be distributed to current staff and students of an academic institution for HCWs. The survey questionnaire will consist of a demographic questions section consisting of six items and a vaccine confidence section comprising six items in Likert scale format.

A multinomial logistic regression model will be employed to identify factors associated with vaccine confidence and intention. The strength of association will be assessed using odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. Statistical significance will be defined at a p-value <0.05.

Ethics and disseminationEthics approval has been obtained for the study from Stellenbosch University (HREC Reference # S19/01/014 (PhD)). The results will be shared with relevant health authorities, presented at conferences, and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

410,HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE RESPIRATORY INFECTION BY COVID-19: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL,"The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) represents a major public health problem due to its rapid spread and its ability to generate severe pneumonia. Thus, it is essential to find a treatment that reduces mortality. Our objective was to estimate whether treatment with 400 mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine for 10 days reduces in-hospital mortality in subjects with severe respiratory disease due to COVID-19 compared with placebo.

Material and methodsA double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of severe disease by COVID-19 through an intention-to-treat analysis. Eligible for the study were adults aged more than 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and lung injury requiring hospitalization with or without mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: days of mechanical ventilation, days of hospitalization and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events.

ResultsA total of 214 patients with COVID-19 were recruited, randomized and analyzed. They were hypoxemic with a mean SpO2 of 65% {+/-} 20, tachycardic (pulse rate 108{+/-}17 min-1) and tachypneic (32 {+/-}10 min-1); 162 were under mechanical ventilation at randomization. Thirty-day mortality was similar in both groups (38% in Hydroxychloroquine vs. 41% in placebo, hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI] 0.51-1.53). In the surviving participants, no significant difference was found in secondary outcomes.

ConclusionNo beneficial effect or significant harm could be demonstrated in our randomized controlled trial including 214 patients, using relatively low doses of Hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

AimTo assess the impact of PPE use on HCWs physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, we examined factors related with a greater risk of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use.

MethodsWe applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and the Cochrane criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL and pre-print services (medRxiv) from January 1, 2020 to December 27, 2020.

FindingsOur review included 14 studies with 11,746 HCWs from 16 countries. The estimated overall prevalence of adverse events among HCWs was 78% (95% CI: 66.7-87.5%) with a range from 42.8% to 95.1% among studies. The prevalence of adverse events was higher for the studies with poor quality compared to those with moderate quality (83.5% vs. 67.1%), while increased sample size was related with decreased prevalence (p<0.001). The most frequent adverse events were headache (55.9%), dry skin (54.4%), dyspnoea (53.4%), pressure injuries (40.4%), itching (39.8%), hyperhidrosis (38.5%), and dermatitis (31.0%). Among others, the following factors were related with the risk of adverse events among HCWs due to PPE use: female gender, younger age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, smoking pre-existing headache, longer duration of shifts wearing PPE, increased consecutive days with PPE, and increased exposure to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionThe frequency of adverse events amongst HCWs due to PPE use is very high. Further studies should be conducted since the limitations of this review do not allow us to infer conclusive results especially in case of risk factors for the occurrence of adverse events.

414,"Association between Median Household Income, State Medicaid Expansion Status, and COVID-19 Outcomes Across US Counties","ObjectiveThe relationship between socioeconomic status and its interaction with States Medicaid-expansion policies on COVID-19 outcomes across United States (US) counties are uncertain. To determine the association between median-household-income and its interaction with State Medicaid-expansion status on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in US counties

MethodsLongitudinal, retrospective analysis of 3142 US counties (including District of Columbia) to study the relationship between County-level median-household-income (defined by US Census Bureaus Small-Area-Income-and-Poverty-Estimates) and COVID-19 incidence and mortality per 100000 of the population in US counties from January 20, 2020 through December 6, 2020. County median-household-income was log-transformed and stratified by quartiles. Medicaid-expansion status was defined by US States Medicaid-expansion adoption as of first reported US COVID-19 infection, January 20, 2020. Multilevel mixed-effects generalized-linear-model with negative binomial distribution and log link function compared quartiles of median-household-income and COVID-19 incidence and mortality, reported as incidence-risk-ratio (IRR) and mortality-risk-ratio (MRR), respectively. Models adjusted for county socio-demographic and comorbidity conditions, population density, and hospitals, with a random intercept for states. Multiplicative interaction tested for Medicaid-expansion*income quartiles on COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

ResultsThere was no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence across counties by income quartiles or by Medicaid expansion status. Conversely, significant differences exist between COVID-19 mortality by income quartiles and by Medicaid expansion status. The association between income quartiles and COVID-19 mortality was significant only in counties from non-Medicaid-expansion states but not significant in counties from Medicaid-expansion states (P<0.01 for interaction). For non-Medicaid-expansion states, counties in the lowest income quartile had a 41% increase in COVID-19 mortality compared to counties in the highest income quartile (MRR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.25-1.59).

Conclusions and RelevanceMedian-household-income was not related to COVID-19 incidence but negatively related to COVID-19 mortality in US counties of states without Medicaid-expansion. It was unrelated to COVID-19 mortality in counties of states that adopted Medicaid-expansion. These findings suggest that expanded healthcare coverage should be investigated further to attenuate the excessive COVID-19 mortality risk associated with low-income communities.

Key FindingsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there a relationship between COVID-19 outcomes (incidence and mortality) and household income and status of Medicaid expansion of US counties?

FindingsIn this longitudinal, retrospective analysis of 3142 US counties, we found no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence across US counties by quartiles of household income. However, counties with lower median household income had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, but only in non-Medicaid expansion states.

415,Impact of Vaccination and Testing in an Urban Campus model for the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"The crisis induced by the Coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted educational institutes. Even with vaccination efforts underway, it is not clear that sufficient confidence will be achieved for schools to reopen soon.

This paper considers the impact of vaccination rates and testing rates to reduce infections and hospitalizations and evaluates strategies that will allow educational institute in urban settings to reopen. These strategies are also applicable to businesses and would help plan reopening in order to help the economy.

Our analysis is based on a graph model where nodes represent population groups and edges represent population exchanges due to commuting populations. The commuting population is associated with edges and is associated with one of the end nodes of the edge during part of the time period and with the other node during the remainder of the time period. The progression of the disease at each node is determined via compartment models, that include vaccination rates and testing to place infected people in quarantine along with consideration of asymptomatic and symptomatic populations. Applying this to a university population in Chicago with a substantial commuter population, chosen to be 80% as an illustration, provides an analysis which specifies benefits of testing and vaccination strategies over a time period of 150 days.",Sanjiv Kapoor; Yi Zhang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251040,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251040,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
416,Age-related heterogeneity in Neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following BNT162b2 vaccination,"BackgroundVaccines remain the cornerstone for containing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. mRNA vaccines provide protection in clinical trials using a two-dose approach, separated by a three to four week gap. UK policy in 2021 is to extend the dosing interval from three to twelve weeks. There is a paucity of data in the elderly, even though these individuals are the first to receive vaccines due to risk of severe disease. Here we assessed real world immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2.

MethodsWe did a prospective cohort study of individuals presenting for first dose vaccination. Following the first and second doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, we measured IFN{gamma} T cell responses, as well as binding antibody (IgA, IgG and IgG1-4) responses to Spike and Spike RBD. We also measured neutralising antibody responses to Spike in sera using a lentiviral pseudotyping system. We correlated age with immune responses and compared responses after the first and second doses.

FindingsMedian age was 63.5 years amongst 42 participants. Three weeks after the first dose a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved adequate neutralisation titre of >1:20 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 (8/17 versus 19/24, p=0.03). Geometric mean neutralisation titres in this age group after the first dose were lower than in younger individuals (p<0.001). Binding IgA and IgG1 and 3 responses developed post vaccination, as observed in natural infection. T-cell responses were not different in those above or below 80 years. Following the second dose, 50% neutralising antibody titres were above 1:20 in all individuals and there was no longer a difference by age grouping.

InterpretationA high proportion of individuals above the age of 80 have suboptimal neutralising antibody responses following first dose vaccination with BNT162b2, cautioning against extending the dosing interval in this high risk population.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for research articles published from June 1st 2020 until February 8th 2021. We limited our search to English language papers. We used the following terms: ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""vaccine"" OR ""BNT162b2"" OR ""Pfizer/BioNTech"". We identified only one paper. It showed lower neutralising antibody responses following the first dose of BNT162b in a small group of 12 individuals over 65 compared to those under 65. There were no data for patients above 82 years of age and no data on T cell responses by age. We did not find pre-prints on age related heterogeneity in individuals immunised with the Pfizer/BioNtech mRNA vaccine.

What this study addsWe show real world immune responses in forty two individuals to BNT162b2, spanning both T and B cell arms. We show that a high proportion of individuals above the age of 80 have suboptimal neutralising antibody responses following first dose vaccination with BNT162b2. The second dose generates robust responses in these poor responders. We quantify SARS-CoV-2 Spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) IgA and IgG isotypes as well as IgG subclasses. Finally we show that SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are robustly induced by first dose vaccination and are not impacted by age.

Implications of all the available evidenceThese data caution against extending the dosing interval of BNT162b2 in the elderly population, particularly during periods of high transmission, and also where there is risk of infection with variants that are less susceptible to vaccine-elicited neutralising antibodies.",Dami Collier; Isabella Ferreira; Rawlings Datir; Bo Meng; Laura Bergamaschi; - The CITIID-NIHR Bioresource COVID-19 Collaboration; Anne Elmer; Nathalie Kingston; Barbara Graves; Barbara Graves; Kenneth GC Smith; John Bradley; Paul Lyons; Lourdes Ceron-Gutierrez; Gabriela Barcenas-Morales; Rainer Doffinger; Mark Wills; Ravindra K Gupta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251054,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251054,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
417,Risk Factors for Infection and Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in People with Autoimmune Diseases,"BackgroundPeople with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions who take immunomodulatory/suppressive medications may have a higher risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences.

ObjectiveAssess whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterize pandemic-associated changes to care.

DesignLongitudinal registry study

Participants4666 individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists in neurology, rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology or gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins

MeasurementsPeriodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare

ResultsA total of 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medication exposure) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in multivariable models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were each associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Pandemic-related disruption to care was common. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions. Individuals experiencing changes to employment or income were at highest odds of care disruption.

LimitationsResults may not be generalizable to all patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Information was self-reported.

418,Increased SAR-CoV-2 shedding associated with reduced disease severity despite continually emerging genetic variants,"Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, genetic variants have continued to emerge, complicating strategies for mitigating the disease burden of COVID-19. Positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs (n=8,735) were collected from Missouri, USA, from March-October 2020, and viral genomes (n=178) were sequenced. Hospitalization status and length of stay were extracted from medical charts of 1,335 patients and integrated with emerging genetic variants and viral shedding analyses for assessment of clinical impacts. Multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Missouri, primarily from Australia, Europe, and domestic states, were observed. Four local lineages rapidly emerged and spread across urban and rural regions in Missouri. While the majority of Missouri viruses harbored Spike-D614G mutations, a large number of unreported mutations were identified among Missouri viruses, including seven in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex and Spike protein that were positively selected. A 15.6-fold increase in viral RNA levels in swab samples occurred from March to May and remained elevated. Accounting for other comorbidities, individuals test-positive for COVID-19 with high viral loads were less likely to be hospitalized (odds ratio=0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.20, 0.77) and had shorter hospital stays (hazard ratio=0.34, p=0.003) than those with low viral loads. Overall, the first eight months of the pandemic in Missouri saw multiple locally acquired mutants emerge and dominate in urban and rural locations. Although we were unable to find associations between specific variants and greater disease severity, Missouri COVID-positive individuals that presented with increased viral shedding had less severe disease by several measures.",Cynthia Y Tang; Yang Wang; Cheng Gao; David R Smith; Jane A McElroy; Tao Li; Karen Segovia; Tricia Haynes; Richard Hammer; Christopher Sampson; Detlef Ritter; Christopher Schulze; Robin Trotman; Grace M Lidl; Richard Webby; Jun Hang; Xiu-Feng Wan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250928,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250928,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
419,Antibody responses boosted in seropositive healthcare workers after single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine,"Current guidelines recommend that individuals who have had COVID-19 should receive the identical vaccine regimen as those who have not had the infection. This includes two doses of the mRNA platform vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer; mRNA-1273/Moderna) that are approved for use in the United States. In this brief report, we show that after a single dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, individuals that had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection had significantly higher antibody levels than individuals that had no history of infection. This provides the rationale for changing vaccination policy to deliver only a single dose to individuals with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection that may free up additional doses for individuals that have no preexisting immunity to the virus. Future study of other immune parameters such as T cell response and durability of immune response should be rapidly undertaken in individuals that had COVID-19 prior to vaccination.",Todd Bradley; - CODIEFY study team; Elin Grundberg; Rangaraj Selvarangan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251078,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251078,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
420,IgA autoantibodies target pulmonary surfactant in patients with severe COVID-19,"Complications affecting the lung are hallmarks of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While there is evidence for autoimmunity in severe COVID-19, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we established a prospective observational cohort to study lung specific autoantibodies (auto-Abs). Incubation of plasma from severe COVID-19 patients with healthy human lung tissue revealed the presence of IgA antibodies binding to surfactant-producing pneumocytes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and protein pull-downs using porcine surfactant confirmed the presence of auto-Abs binding to surfactant proteins in severe COVID-19 patients. Mass spectrometry and ELISAs with recombinant proteins identified IgA auto-Abs that target human surfactant proteins B and C. In line with these findings, lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients showed reduced pulmonary surfactant. Our data suggest that IgA-driven autoimmunity against surfactant may result in disease progression of COVID-19.",Tobias Sinnberg; Christa Lichtensteiger; Omar Hasan Ali; Oltin Tiberiu Pop; Mara Gilardi; Lorenz Risch; David Bomze; Philipp Kohler; Pietro Vernazza; Werner C Albrich; Christian R Kahlert; Silvio D Brugger; Marie-Therese Abdou; Carl Zinner; Alexandar Tzankov; Martin Roecken; Lukas Kern; Martin H Brutsche; Hubert Kalbacher; Ana Velic; Boris Macek; Josef M Penninger; Matthias S Matter; Lukas Flatz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250940,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250940,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
421,Infection and mRNA-1273 vaccine antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 UK variant,"Antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein correlate with protection against COVID-19. Serum neutralizing antibodies appear early after symptom onset following SARS-CoV-2 infection and can last for several months. Similarly, the messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, generates serum neutralizing antibodies that are detected through at least day 119. However, the recent emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant has raised significant concerns about the breadth of these neutralizing antibody responses. In this study, we used a live virus neutralization assay to compare the neutralization potency of sera from infected and vaccinated individuals against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7. We found that both infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies were effective at neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. These findings support the notion that in the context of the UK variant, vaccine-induced immunity can provide protection against COVID-19. As additional SARS-CoV-2 viral variants continue to emerge, it is crucial to monitor their impact on neutralizing antibody responses following infection and vaccination.",Venkata Viswanadh Edara; Katharine Floyd; Lilin Lai; Meredith Gardner; William Hudson; Anne Piantadosi; Jesse Waggoner; Ahmed Babiker; Rafi Ahmed; Xuping Xie; Kumari Lokugamage; Vineet Menachery; Pei-Yong Shi; - COVID-19 Neutralization Study Group; Mehul S Suthar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250799,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250799,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
422,SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are lower in children and increase with age and time after infection,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of children leads to a mild illness and the immunological differences with adults remains unclear. We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in adults and children (<13 years of age) with RT-PCR confirmed asymptomatic and symptomatic infection for long-term memory, phenotype and polyfunctional cytokines. Acute and memory CD4+ T cell responses to structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins significantly increased with age, whilst CD8+ T cell responses increased with time post infection. Infected children had significantly lower CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 structural and ORF1ab proteins compared to infected adults. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses were comparable in magnitude to uninfected negative adult controls. In infected adults CD4+ T cell specificity was skewed towards structural peptides, whilst children had increased contribution of ORF1ab responses. This may reflect differing T cell compartmentalisation for antigen processing during antigen exposure or lower recruitment of memory populations. T cell polyfunctional cytokine production was comparable between children and adults, but children had a lower proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD4+ T cell effector memory. Compared to adults, children had significantly lower levels of antibodies to {beta}-coronaviruses, indicating differing baseline immunity. Total T follicular helper responses was increased in children during acute infection indicating rapid co-ordination of the T and B cell responses. However total monocyte responses were reduced in children which may be reflective of differing levels of inflammation between children and adults. Therefore, reduced prior {beta}-coronavirus immunity and reduced activation and recruitment of de novo responses in children may drive milder COVID-19 pathogenesis.",Carolyn A Cohen; Athena PY Li; Asmaa Hachim; David SC Hui; Mike YW Kwan; Owen TY Tsang; Susan S Chiu; Wai Hung Chan; Yat Sun Yau; Niloufar Kavian; Fionn NL Ma; Eric HY Lau; Samuel MS Cheng; Leo LM Poon; Malik JS Peiris; Sophie A Valkenburg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250988,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250988,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
423,Impact of systemic corticosteroids on hospitalized patients with COVID-19: January 2021 Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated worldwide investigation into a myriad of potential therapeutic agents, including corticosteroids. The first RCT reporting results on the impact of systemic corticosteroids on COVID-19 in a peer reviewed journal was the RECOVERY trial published in July, 2020. The RECOVERY trial showed a reduced risk of 28-day mortality in patients who received oral or intravenous dexamethasone for 10 days.

This study is a meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs aims to estimate the association of systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to the usual care or placebo on all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Software based tools to accelerate the analysis process.

MethodsMeta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs comparing systemic corticosteroids to usual care or placebo.

ResultsFive English language RCTs were identified, including data from 7645 hospitalized patients worldwide using systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone in COVID-19 positive patients. Three RCTs were discontinued when preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial became available.

Meta-analysis of all identified RCTs showed no difference in survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to usual care or placebo (Odds ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.64-1.05, p = 0.09). Subgroup analysis from the 1967 critically ill patients in the identified RCTs showed improved survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy (Odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.87, p = 0.01).

ConclusionsThis meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed literature by January 1, 2021 showed reduced mortality in critically ill patients but not all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids. The early termination of three of the included RCTs because of the preliminary results of the RECOVERY trial is likely to have dramatically influenced the results of this meta-analysis.

424,Arabic validation and cross-cultural adaptation of the 5C scale for assessment of COVID-19 vaccines psychological antecedents,"BackgroundIn the Arab countries, there has not been yet a specific validated questionnaire that can assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among the general population. This study, therefore, aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the 5C scale into the Arabic language.

MethodsThe 5C scale was translated into Arabic by two independent bilingual co-authors, and then subsequently translated back into English. After reconciling translation disparities, the final Arabic questionnaire was disseminated into four randomly selected Arabic countries (Egypt, Libya, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia). Data from 350 Arabic speaking adults (aged [&ge;]18 years) were included in the final analysis. Convergent, discriminant, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha.

ResultsAge of participants ranged between 18 to 73 years; 57.14% were females, 37.43% from Egypt, 36.86%, from UAE, and 30% were healthcare workers. The 5 sub-scales of the questionnaire met the criterion of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha [&ge;]0.7). Convergent validity was identified by the significant inter-item and item-total correlation (P<0.001). Discriminant validity was reported as inter-factor correlation matrix (<0.7). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 15 items of the questionnaire could be summarized into five factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the hypothesized five-factor model of the 15-item questionnaire was satisfied with adequate psychometric properties and fit with observed data (RMSEA=0.060,GFI=0.924, CFI=0.957, TLI=0.937, SRMR=0.076 & NFI=906).

425,Bronchoscopy in COVID19 ARDS patients on mechanical ventilation: a prospective study,"BackgroundBronchoscopy has been done sparingly in COVID19 patients due to the risk of aerosol generation, with few reports describing its clinical utility. We describe a study on bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated (MV) COVID-19 patients outlining the procedural, clinical, utilitarian and safety aspects.

MethodsBedside bronchoscopy was performed in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases on MV; only positive cases were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, bronchoscopic and laboratory findings were noted and analysed.

Results98 procedures were performed on 61 patients, mean age of 62.1 years, 51 (83.6%) males. 42 patients (69%) had at least 1 co-morbidity. Major indications for bronchoscopy were new radiographic infiltrates with clinical deterioration, increased endotracheal tube (ETT) secretions and haemorrhagic secretions/hemoptysis. Common findings were copious secretions in 87 (88.8%), purulent in 61%, mucoid in 18%, haemorrhagic in 7% and frothy in 14% cases. Morphologically, hyperaemic airways were seen in 85 (86.7%) cases, ranging from mild (61%) to moderate-severe (39%). On the management front, antibiotics were changed in 31 (31.6%) cases based on bronchoscopic findings. Other significant changes included reduction or stopping of steroids and anticoagulation, fluid, and diuretic adjustment and ETT repositioning. The incidence of bacterial superinfection was also high (54% culture positivity for various bacteria), a significant number (94%) with multi-drug resistant organisms. Fungi were seen in 7 cases (7.1%). Pneumocystis jiroveci was not seen and cytology did not show any viral inclusions. Therapeutic mucus plug removal was done in 30 cases (30.6%), and hemoptysis control in 4% cases. The procedures were safe with no complications, and none of the HCW developed any COVID19 infection.

426,Human mobility and COVID-19 transmission: a systematic review and future directions,"Without a widely distributed vaccine, controlling human mobility has been identified and promoted as the primary strategy to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. Many studies have reported the relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 transmission by utilizing the spatial-temporal information of mobility data from various sources. To better understand the role of human mobility in the pandemic, we conducted a systematic review of articles that measure the relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 in terms of their data sources, statistical models, and key findings. Following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, we selected 47 articles from Web of Science Core Collection up to September 2020. Restricting human mobility reduced the transmission of COVID-19 spatially, although the effectiveness and stringency of policy implementation vary temporally and spatially across different stages of the pandemic. We call for prompt and sustainable measures to control the pandemic. We also recommend researchers 1) to enhance multi-disciplinary collaboration; 2) to adjust the implementation and stringency of mobility-control policies in corresponding to the rapid change of the pandemic; 3) to improve statistical models used in analyzing, simulating, and predicting the transmission of the disease; and 4) to enrich the source of mobility data to ensure data accuracy and suability.",Mengxi Zhang; Siqin Wang; Tao Hu; Xiaokang Fu; Xiaoyue Wang; Yaxin Hu; Briana Halloran; Yunhe Cui; Haokun Liu; Zhimin Liu; Shuming Bao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250889,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250889,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True

DESIGNThis is an institutional review board approved cohort study in patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit admission. Patients admitted and requiring oxygen supplementation were treated with either methylprednisolone or dexamethasone.

SETTINGThis study takes place in the intensive care units at a large, tertiary, public teaching hospital serving a primarily low-income community in urban Los Angeles.

PATIENTSAll eligible patients admitted to the intensive care unit for COVID-19 respiratory failure from March 1 to July 31, 2020 were included in this study.

INTERVENTIONSA total of 262 patients were grouped as receiving usual care (n=75), methylprednisolone dosed at least at 1mg/kg/day for [&ge;] 3 days (n=104), or dexamethasone dosed at least at 6 mg for [&ge;] 7 days (n=83).

MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTSAll-cause mortality within 50 days of initial corticosteroid treatment as compared to usual care was calculated. The mortality effect was then stratified based on levels of respiratory support received by the patient.

In this cohort of 262 patients with severe COVID-19, all-cause mortalities in the usual care, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone groups were 41.3%, 16.4% and 26.5% at 50 days (p <0.01) respectively. In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 42% lower in the methylprednisolone group than in the dexamethasone group (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI: 0.235-0.956, p=0.0385).

428,A Dynamic Bayesian Model for Identifying High-Mortality Risk in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"IntroductionAs COVID-19 hospitalization rates remain high, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic factors to improve treatment. Our analysis, to our knowledge, is one of the first to quantify the risk associated with dynamic clinical measurements taken throughout the course of hospitalization.

MethodsWe collected data for 553 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital whose eventual outcomes were known. The data collected for the patients included demographics, comorbidities and laboratory values taken at admission and throughout the course of hospitalization. We trained multivariate Markov prognostic models to identify high-risk patients at admission along with a dynamic measure of risk incorporating time-dependent changes in patients laboratory values.

ResultsFrom the set of factors available upon admission, the Markov model determined that age >80 years, history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased mortality risk. The lab values upon admission most associated with mortality included neutrophil percentage, RBC, RDW, protein levels, platelets count, albumin levels and MCHC. Incorporating dynamic changes in lab values throughout hospitalization lead to dramatic gains in the predictive accuracy of the model and indicated a catalogue of variables for determining high-risk patients including eosinophil percentage, WBC, platelets, pCO2, RDW, LUC count, alkaline phosphatase and albumin.

429,COVID-19 infection and subsequent thromboembolism: A self-controlled case series analysis of a population cohort,"ImportanceAn unexpectedly large number of people infected with Covid-19 appear to have experienced ischaemic stroke or thrombotic event.

ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the risk associations between Covid-19 infection and thromboembolism.

DesignThis is a self-controlled case-series study in Scotland. Their incidence rates during the risk interval (5 days before to 56 days after the positive test) and the control interval (the remaining periods) were compared intra-personally.

SettingPopulation-based.

ParticipantsIndividuals with confirmed (positive test) Covid-19 and at least one thromboembolic event between March 2018 and October 2020.

ExposureCovid-19 test positive.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresMyocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke, deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) hospital admissions and deaths.

ResultsAcross Scotland, 1,449 individuals tested positive for Covid-19 and experienced a thromboembolic event. The risk of thromboembolism was significantly elevated over the whole risk period but highest in the 7 days following the positive test (IRR 12.01, 95% CI 9.91-14.56), especially among people [&le;]75 years (IRR 22.78, 95% CI 17.58-29.53). Risk of MI, stroke, PE and DVT were all significantly higher in the week following a positive test. The risk of PE and DVT was particularly high and remained significantly elevated even 56 days following the test.

Conclusions and relevanceConfirmed Covid-19 infection was associated with early elevated risk of MI, ischaemic stroke, and stronger and long elevations in risk with DVT and PE, reinforcing the need to consider monitoring and early diagnosis. Treatment and prevention trials may need to be considered out of hospital on the basis of risk stratification.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes Covid-19 infection increase the risk of thromboembolism?

FindingsAmong 1,449 individuals in Scotland who were tested positive of Covid-19 and had at least one thromboembolic events, the risk of thromboembolism was significantly elevated in the 7 days following the positive test (IRR 12.01, 95% CI 9.91-14.56). The risk of PE and DVT was particularly high and remained significantly elevated even 56 days following the test.

430,GPS-estimated foot traffic data and venue selection for COVID-19 serosurveillance studies,"1Tracking the dynamics and spread of COVID-19 is critical to mounting an effective response to the pandemic. In the absence of randomized representative serological surveys, many SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies have relied on convenience sampling to estimate cumulative incidence. One common approach is to recruit at frequently visited community locations (""venue-based"" sampling), but the sources of bias and uncertainty associated with this strategy are still poorly understood. Here, we used data from a venue-based community serosurveillance study, GPS-estimated foot traffic data, and data on confirmed COVID-19 cases to report an estimate of cumulative incidence in Somerville, Massachusetts, and a methodological strategy to quantify and reduce uncertainty in serology-based cumulative incidence estimates obtained via convenience sampling. The mismatch between the geographic distribution of participants home locations (the ""participant catchment distribution"") and the geographic distribution of infections is an important determinant of uncertainty in venue-based and other convenience sampling strategies. We found that uncertainty in cumulative incidence estimates can vary by a factor of two depending how well the participant catchment distribution matches the known or expected geographic distribution of prior infections. GPS-estimated business foot traffic data provides an important proxy measure for the participant catchment area and can be used to select venue locations that minimize uncertainty in cumulative incidence.",Tyler S Brown; Pablo Martinez de Salazar Munoz; Abhishek Bhatia; Bridget Bunda; Ellen K Williams; David Bor; James S Miller; Amir Mohareb; Vivek Naranbai; Wilfredo Garcia Beltran; Tyler E Miller; Julia Thierauf; Wenxin Yang; Doug Kress; Kristen Stelljes; Keith Johnson; Daniel B Larremore; Jochen Lennerz; A.

431,"COVID19-related and all-cause mortality among middle-aged and older adults across the first epidemic wave of SARS-COV-2 infection in the region of Tarragona, Spain: results from the COVID19 TARRACO Cohort Study, March-June 2020.","BackgroundDirect and indirect COVID19-related mortality is uncertain. This study investigated COVID19-related and all-cause deaths among middle-aged and older adults during the first wave of COVID19 epidemic period, assessing mortality risks by pre-existing socio-demographic and medical underlying conditions.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study involving 79,083 individuals [&ge;]50 years-old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Baseline cohort characteristics (age/sex, comorbidities and medications/vaccinations history) were established at study start (01/03/2020) and main outcomes were COVID19-related deaths (occurred in patients diagnosed with the disease) and all-cause deaths occurred among cohort members between 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Mortality risks were assessed by Cox regression analyses.

ResultsCohort members were followed for 1,356,358 persons-weeks, occurring 576 all-cause deaths (124 COVID19-related). All-cause mortality rate was 42.5 deaths per 100,000 persons-week, being 22.8 in healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, 236.4 in COVID19-excluded/PCR-negative subjects, 493.7 in COVID19-compatible/PCR-unperformed subjects and 4009.1 in COVID19-confirmed patients. In multivariable analyses, increasing age, sex male, nursing-home residence, cancer, neurologic, cardiac or liver disease, receiving diuretics, systemic corticosteroids, proton-pump inhibitors and benzodiazepines were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality; conversely, receiving renin-angiotensin inhibitors and statins were associated with reduced risk. Age/years, sex male and nursing-home residence were strong predictors for COVID19-related mortality, but none comorbidity appeared significantly associated with an increased risk.

ConclusionApart from direct COVID19-related deaths (which represented almost 22% of all-cause mortality), theoretically COVID19-excluded patients (PCR-negative) suffered considerable greater all-cause mortality than healthy/unrelated-COVID19 subjects, which could explain, in part, the large excess deaths observed across the COVID19 pandemic.",Angel Vila-corcoles; Eva Satue-Gracia; Angel Vila-Rovira; Cinta de Diego-Cabanes; Maria Jose Forcadell-Peris; Olga Ochoa-Gondar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251028,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251028,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
432,How did COVID-19 measures impact sexual behaviour and access to STI&HIV services in Panama? Results from a national cross-sectional online survey,"ObjectiveTo describe changes in sexual behaviours, including virtual sex (sexting and cybersex), and access to STI&HIV testing and care during COVID-19 measures in Panama.

MethodWe conducted an online cross-sectional survey from August 8 to September 12, 2020, among adults ([&ge;]18 years) residing in Panama. Participants were recruited through social media. Questions included demographics, access to STI&HIV testing and HIV care and sexual behaviours three months before COVID-19 social distancing measures and during social distancing measures (COVID-19 measures). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between variables and behavioural changes.

ResultWe recruited 960 participants; 526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (38.1%) cis-men, and 68 (7.1%) non-binary or another gender; median age was 28y (IQR:23-37y), 531/957 (55.5%) were of mixed-ethnicity (mixed-Indigenous/European/Afro-descendant ancestry). Before COVID-19 measures, virtual sex was reported by 38.5% (181/470) cis-women, 58.4% (184/315) cis-men and 45.0% (27/60) non-binary participants; during COVID-19 measures, virtual sex increased among 17.2% cis-women, 24.7% cis-men and 8.9% non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, 230/800 [28.8%] of participants reported decreased casual sex compared to pre-COVID-19 measures. Compared to pre-COVID-19 measures, decreased casual sex were reported more frequently during COVID-19 measures by cis-men compared to cis-women (39.2% versus 22.9%, urban/rural adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.57-3.01); and by Afro-descendant compared to mixed-ethnicity participants (40.0% versus 29.8%, AOR=1.78, 95%CI:1.07-2.94). Compared to no change in virtual sex (16.8%), increase in virtual sex (38.5%, AOR=1.78, 95%CI:1.10-2.88); and decreased virtual sex (86.7%, AOR=16.53, 95%CI:7.74-35.27) were associated with decreased casual sex encounters. During COVID-19 measures, STI&HIV testing could not be obtained by 58.0% (58/100) participants who needed a test, and interrupted HIV care was reported by 53.3% (8/15) HIV-positive participants.

433,Ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality during the first two waves of the Coronavirus Pandemic: a nationwide cohort study of 29 million adults in England,"BackgroundEthnic minorities have experienced disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates in the UK and many other countries. We compared the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death between ethnic groups in the first and second waves the of COVID-19 pandemic in England. We also investigated whether the factors explaining differences in COVID-19 death between ethnic groups changed between the two waves.

MethodsUsing data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset on individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We estimated age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) in the two waves stratified by ethnic groups and sex. We also estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups compared with the White British population, adjusted for geographical factors, socio-demographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health conditions.

ResultsThe study population included over 28.9 million individuals aged 30-100 years living in private households. In the first wave, all ethnic minority groups had a higher risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the risk of COVID-19 death remained elevated for people from Pakistani (ASMR: 339.9 [95% CI: 303.7 - 376.2] and 166.8 [141.7 - 191.9] deaths per 100,000 population in men and women) and Bangladeshi (318.7 [247.4 - 390.1] and 127.1 [91.1 - 171.3] in men and women)background but not for people from Black ethnic groups. Adjustment for geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave but not in the second wave. Despite an attenuation of the elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, the risk was substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background in both the first and the second waves.

ConclusionBetween the first and second waves of the pandemic, the reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group shows that ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality can be addressed. The continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy changes.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA recent systematic review by Pan and colleagues demonstrated that people of ethnic minority background in the UK and the USA have been disproportionately affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, compared to White populations. While several studies have investigated whether adjusting for socio-demographic and economic factors and medical history reduces the estimated difference in risk of mortality and hospitalisation, the reasons for the differences in the risk of experiencing harms from COVID-19 are still being explored during the course of the pandemic. Studies so far have analysed the ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality in the first wave of the pandemic. The evidence on the temporal trend of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality, especially those from the second wave of the pandemic, is scarce.

Added value of this studyUsing data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Public Health Data Asset on 29 million adults aged 30-100 years living in private households in England, we conducted an observational cohort study to examine the differences in the risk of death involving COVID-19 between ethnic groups in the first wave (from 24th January 2020 until 31st August 2020) and second wave (from 1st September to 28th December 2020). We find that in the first wave all ethnic minority groups were at elevated risk of COVID-19 related death compared to the White British population. In the second wave, the differences in the risk of COVID-19 related death attenuated for Black African and Black Caribbean groups, remained substantially higher in people from Bangladeshi background, and worsened in people from Pakistani background. We also find that some of the factors explaining these differences in mortality have changed in the two waves.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe risk of COVID-19 mortality during the first wave of the pandemic was elevated in people from ethnic minority background. An appreciable reduction in the difference in COVID-19 mortality in the second wave of the pandemic between people from Black ethnic background and people from the White British group is reassuring, but the continued higher rate of mortality in people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani background is alarming and requires focused public health campaign and policy response. Focusing on treating underlying conditions, although important, may not be enough in reducing the inequalities in COVID-19 mortality. Focused public health policy as well as community mobilisation and participatory public health campaign involving community leaders may help reduce the existing and widening inequalities in COVID-19 mortality.",Vahe Nafilyan; Nazrul Islam; Rohini Mathur; Daniel Ayoubkhani; Amitava Banerjee; Myer Glickman; Ben Humberstone; Ian DIamond; Kamlesh Khunti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251004,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251004,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
434,Using a household structured branching process to analyse contact tracing in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"We explore strategies of contact tracing, case isolation and quarantine of exposed contacts to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic using a branching process model with household structure. This structure reflects higher transmission risks among household members than among non-household members, and is also the level at which physical distancing policies have been applied. We explore implementation choices that make use of household structure, and investigate strategies including two-step tracing, backwards tracing, smartphone tracing and tracing upon symptom report rather than test results. The primary model outcome is the effect on the growth rate of the epidemic under contact tracing in combination with different levels of physical distancing, and we investigate epidemic extinction times to indicate the time period over which interventions must be sustained. We consider effects of non-uptake of isolation/quarantine, non-adherence, and declining recall of contacts over time. We find that compared to self-isolation of cases but no contact tracing, a household-based contact tracing strategy allows for some relaxation of physical distancing measures; however, it is unable to completely control the epidemic in the absence of other measures. Even assuming no imported cases and sustainment of moderate distancing, testing and tracing efforts, the time to bring the epidemic to extinction could be in the order of months to years.",Martyn Fyles; Elizabeth Fearon; Christopher Overton; - University of Manchester COVID-19 Working Group; Tom Wingfield; Graham F Medley; Ian Hall; Lorenzo Pellis; Thomas House,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250992,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21250992,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,True
435,"Field performance evaluation of the PanBio rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay in an epidemic driven by 501Y.v2 (lineage B.1.351) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa","BackgroundSouth Africa was the African country most severely affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during 2020, experiencing 2 waves of infection. During the first wave, diagnostics were largely based on reverse transcription-linked PCR (RT-PCR). The Abbott PanBio antigen test was deployed during the 2nd wave which was driven by emergence of the 501Y.v2 variant. At the time of evaluation in mid-November 2020, 501Y.v2 was the dominant circulating virus in Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape Province.

MethodsA prospective diagnostic evaluation study was undertaken, during a period of high community transmission, to evaluate the field performance of the PanBio antigen RTD. Testing was conducted at mobile community testing centres on 677 ambulant patients seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing. RT-PCR was performed on the original naso-pharyngeal antigen swabs to evaluate test performance.

ResultsOf 146 RT-PCR positive individuals, 101 were RTD positive in the clinic. The antigen RTD had an overall sensitivity of 69.2% (95%CI 61.4, 75.8) and specificity of 99.0% (95%CI 98.8, 99.3) in this clinical context. Sensitivity was strongly dependent on the amount of virus in clinical samples, as reflected by the PCR cycle threshold (CT) value, with 100% detection in samples where the CT was <20, 96% with CT between 20-25, 89% with CT between 26-30 and 64% when CT was 31-35.

ConclusionsThe assay reliably detected 501Y.v2 infections in ambulatory ill patients. Assay sensitivity was >90% in patients with high viral loads who are expected to be most infectious.

Similar newborn protection would be expected after maternal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19). There is a significant and urgent need for research regarding safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Here, we report the first known case of an infant with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detectable in cord blood after maternal vaccination.

Case presentationA vigorous, healthy, full-term female was born to a COVID-19 naive mother who had received a single dose of mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 three weeks prior to delivery. Cord blood antibodies (IgG) were detected to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 at time of delivery.

This study determined overall intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and identified factors that predict intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Canada.

MethodsIndividuals from research cohorts from the general population of British Columbia aged 25-69 were invited complete an online survey based on validated scales and theoretical frameworks to explore intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Two multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to determine factors associated with intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsOf 4,528 respondents, 79.8% intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. In multivariable modeling, respondents who intended to receive the vaccine had higher vaccine attitudinal scores (p <0.001), reported greater influence of direct social norms (p = 0.001), and indirect social norms, including their family physician (p = 0.024), and Provincial Health Officer (p = 0.011). Older individuals (>60 years) were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine, while females (95%CI 0.57,0.93), those with less than high school education (95%CI 0.5,0.76), those who self-identified as non-white (95%CI 0.60,0.92), self-identified as Indigenous (95%CI 0.36,0.84) and essential non-health care workers (95%CI 0.59,0.86) had lower adjusted odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsTo optimize vaccine coverage, public health should focus on key messages around vaccine safety and benefit, and leverage trusted practitioners for messaging.

439,Evaluation of individual and ensemble probabilistic forecasts of COVID-19 mortality in the US,"Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. In 2020, the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized hundreds of thousands of specific predictions from more than 50 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. This manuscript systematically evaluates 23 models that regularly submitted forecasts of reported weekly incident COVID-19 mortality counts in the US at the state and national level. One of these models was a multi-model ensemble that combined all available forecasts each week. The performance of individual models showed high variability across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Half of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a naive baseline model. In combining the forecasts from all teams, the ensemble showed the best overall probabilistic accuracy of any model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions farther into the future, with probabilistic accuracy at a 20-week horizon more than 5 times worse than when predicting at a 1-week horizon.

Efficient sequencing strategies enabling the retrieval of the maximum number of high quality, full-length genomes are hence indispensable. Here, we describe for the first time a combined approach of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and NGS to evaluate five commercially available sequence capture panels targeting SARS-CoV-2. In doing so, we were not only able to determine the most sensitive and specific capture panel, but to discriminate their mode of action and number of read pairs needed to recover a high quality full length genome. Thereby, we are providing essential information for all sequencing laboratories worldwide striving for maximizing the sequencing output and simultaneously minimizing time, costs and sequencing resources.",Alexandra Rehn; Peter Braun; Mandy Knuepfer; Roman Woelfel; Markus H.

441,SARS-CoV-2 ORF7b: is a bat virus protein homologue a major cause of COVID-19 symptoms?,"ORF7b is an accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic. Using cell-free synthesized ORF7b, we experimentally show that ORF7b assembles into stable multimers. The ORF7b sequence shows a transmembrane segment, which multimerizes through a leucine zipper. We hypothesize that ORF7b has the potential to interfere with important cellular processes that involve leucine-zipper formation, and present two particularly striking examples. First, leucine zippers are central in heart rhythm regulation through multimerization of phospholamban in cardiomyocytes. Second, epithelial cell-cell adhesion relies on E-cadherins, which dimerize using a transmembrane leucine zipper. Most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including heart arrythmias, odor loss, impaired oxygen uptake and intestinal problems, up to multiorgan failure, can be rationalized by a possible interference of ORF7b with the functions of these proteins. We ask whether this is pure coincidence, or whether our observations point to disruption by ORF7b of vital processes in COVID-19.",Marie-Laure Fogeron; Roland Montserret; Johannes Zehnder; Minh-Ha Nguyen; Marie Dujardin; Louis Brigandat; Laura Cole; Marti Ninot-Pedrosa; Lauriane Lecoq; Beat H Meier; Anja Bockmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.428650,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.428650,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,False
442,Collaboration between the Fab and Fc contribute to maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates following NVX-CoV2373 subunit vaccine with Matrix-M™ vaccination,"Recently approved vaccines have already shown remarkable protection in limiting SARS-CoV-2 associated disease. However, immunologic mechanism(s) of protection, as well as how boosting alters immunity to wildtype and newly emerging strains, remain incompletely understood. Here we deeply profiled the humoral immune response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a stable recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two dose levels, administered as a single or two-dose regimen with a saponin-based adjuvant Matrix-M. While antigen dose had some effect on Fc-effector profiles, both antigen dose and boosting significantly altered overall titers, neutralization and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints. Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were strongly associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract, pointing to the presence of combined, but distinct, compartment-specific neutralization and Fc-mechanisms as key determinants of protective immunity against infection. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies functionally target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, collectively pointing to the critical collaborative role for Fab and Fc in driving maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.

443,Post-infection treatment with a protease inhibitor increases survival of mice with a fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues to be a serious global public health threat. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a virus protease encoded by SARS-CoV-2, which is essential for virus replication. We have previously reported a series of small molecule 3CLpro inhibitors effective for inhibiting replication of human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and in animal models. Here we generated a series of deuterated variants of a 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376, and evaluated the antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. The deuterated GC376 displayed potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the enzyme and the cell-based assays. The K18-hACE2 mice develop mild to lethal infection commensurate with SARS-CoV-2 challenge doses and was proposed as a model for efficacy testing of antiviral agents. We treated lethally infected mice with a deuterated derivative of GC376. Treatment of K18-hACE2 mice at 24 hr post infection with a derivative (compound 2) resulted in increased survival of mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Lung virus titers were decreased, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in compound 2-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Structural investigation using high-resolution crystallography illuminated binding interactions of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with deuterated variants of GC376.

444,Protein glycosylation is essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 extensively N-glycosylates its surface spike (S) proteins. This post-translational modification is essential to modulate protein conformation and host cell invasion. Each S monomer can be modified with up to 22 N-glycans. To meet the high demand of protein glycosylation during virus replication, SARS-CoV-2 upregulates the expression of host N-glycosylation genes. Although a substantial amount of detail is known about the structure of S protein N-glycans, the role of N-glycosylation in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely undetermined. Here, we investigated the essentiality of the host N-glycosylation pathway and viral N-glycans for SARS-CoV-2 infection. When either monkey or human cells were preincubated with glycosylation inhibitors, including FDA-approved iminosugars, virus infection was significantly reduced. This infection phenotype was confirmed after RNAi knockdown of several glycosylation genes. In addition, enzymatic deglycosylation of whole viral particles confirmed that accessible oligosaccharides on the SARS-CoV-2 surface are essential for host cell infection. Altogether, we show evidence that the normal functioning of the host N- glycosylation machinery is essential not only for SARS-CoV-2 to infect, but also to produce new functional virions. These findings open the door for developing new approaches targeting N-glycosylation against COVID-19.",Aitor Casas-Sanchez; Alessandra Romero-Ramirez; Eleanor Hargreaves; Edward I Patterson; Grant L Hughes; Tobias Zech; Alvaro Acosta-Serrano,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429940,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.429940,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,,False
445,Serological Profile Of Specific Antibodies Against Dominant Antigens Of SARS-CoV-2 In Chilean COVID-19 Patients.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has been a pandemic since March 2020. Currently, the virus has infected more than 50 million people worldwide and more than half a million in Chile. For many coronaviruses, Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins are described as major antigenic molecules, inducing seroconversion and production of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we evaluated the presence in serum of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using western blot, and developed an ELISA test for the qualitative characterization of COVID-19 patients. Patients with an active infection or who have recovered from COVID-19 showed specific immunoblotting patterns for the recombinants S protein and its domains S1 and S2, as well as for the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Anti-N antibodies were more frequently detected than anti-S or anti-S1-RBD antibodies. People who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 did not show reactivity. Finally, indirect ELISA assays using N and S1-RBD proteins, alone or in combination, were established with variable sensitivity and specificity depending on the antigen bound to the solid phase. Overall, Spike showed higher specificity than the nucleocapsid, and comparable sensitivity for both antigens.

446,Furin cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is modulated by O-glycosylation,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the global pandemic contains a unique furin cleavage site in the spike protein (S) that increases viral infectivity and syncytia formation. Here, we show that O-glycosylation near the furin cleavage site is mediated by specific members of the GALNT enzyme family and is dependent on the novel proline at position 681 (P681). We further demonstrate that O-glycosylation of S decreases furin cleavage. Finally, we show that GALNT family members capable of glycosylating S are expressed in human respiratory cells that are targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that O-glycosylation may influence viral infectivity/tropism by modulating furin cleavage of S and provide mechanistic insight into the potential role of P681 mutations in the recently identified, highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant.",Liping Zhang; Matthew Mann; Zulfeqhar Syed; Hayley M.

Whether and when non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can be lifted as vaccination builds up remains key questions. To address them, we built a data-driven SARS-CoV-2 transmission model for China. We estimated that, to prevent local outbreaks to escalate to major widespread epidemics, stringent NPIs need to remain in place at least one year after the start of vaccination. Should NPIs be capable to keep the reproduction number (Rt) around 1.3, vaccination could reduce up to 99% of COVID-19 burden and bring Rt below the epidemic threshold in 9 months.

451,Estimation of infection rate and the population size potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in Japan during 2020,"BackgroundThe infectious respiratory disease COVID-19, caused novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached pandemic status during 2020. The primary statistic data are important to survey the actual circumstances of COVID-19. Here, we report the analysis of the primary data of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020.

MethodsData were collected and released systematically under Japan domestic law. Machine learning was conducted to estimate the positive rate in Japan and four prefectures (Tokyo, Osaka, Chiba, and Fukuoka).

ResultsPrimary data analysis revealed there were at least two peaks of infection in Japan; the first one was during April 2020 and the second one started from November 1, 2020. Estimating the positive rate in Japan as well as in the four prefectures reinforced the above observations. The positive rate in Japan during 2020 was estimated to be around 6% to 8%. We also estimated that 1.95 million people were possibly exposed to the novel virus on October 31, 2020. The numbers of related deaths were over 3,000 people at the end of 2020.

ConclusionWe estimated the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan to be 6-8% in 2020. We also concluded that Japan had at least two infection-spreading periods, the first one being from Jan 19, 2020 until May 2020, and the second one beginning from November 1, 2020.

452,The mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily shaped by the host antiviral defense,"Understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution is a fundamental effort in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus genomes have been broadly evolving due to the high number of infected hosts world-wide. Mutagenesis and selection are the two inter-dependent mechanisms of virus diversification. However, which mechanisms contribute to the mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 remain under-explored. Here, we delineate the contribution of mutagenesis and selection to the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We generated a comprehensive phylogenetic tree with representative genomes. Instead of counting mutations relative to the reference genome, we identified each mutation event at the nodes of the phylogenetic tree. With this approach, we obtained the mutation events that are independent of each other and generated the mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The results suggest that the heterogeneous mutation patterns are mainly reflections of host (i) antiviral mechanisms that are achieved through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins and (ii) probable adaptation against reactive oxygen species.

ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 genomes are evolving worldwide. Revealing the evolutionary characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand host-virus interactions. Here, we aim to understand whether mutagenesis or selection is the primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This study provides an unbiased computational method for profiling and analyzing independently occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The results point out three host antiviral mechanisms shaping the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins.

453,The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and the dynamics of the S gene furin cleavage site in primary human airway epithelia,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the devastating ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which poses a great threat to global public health. The spike (S) polypeptide of SARS-CoV-2 consists of the S1 and S2 subunits and is processed by cellular proteases at the S1/S2 boundary. The inclusion of the 4 amino acids (PRRA) at the S1/S2 boundary forms a furin cleavage site (FCS), 682RRAR{downarrow}S686, distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its closest relative, the SARS-CoV. Various deletions surrounding the FCS have been identified in patients. When SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells, the virus acquired various deletions surrounding the FCS. In the present study, we studied the viral transcriptome in SARS-CoV-2 infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability at the S1/S2 boundary using RNA-seq. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI. Two highly frequent deletions were found at the S1/S2 boundary of the S gene: one is a deletion of 12 amino acids, 678TNSPRRAR{downarrow}SVAS689, which contains the FCS, another is a deletion of 5 amino acids, 675QTQTN679, which is two amino acids upstream of the FCS. Further studies on the dynamics of the FCS deletions in apically released virions revealed that the selective pressure for the FCS maintains the S gene stability in HAE-ALI but with exceptions, in which the FCS deletions are remained at a high rate. Thus, our study presents evidence for the role of unique properties of human airway epithelia in the dynamics of the FCS region during infection of human airways, which is donor-dependent.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429670,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.429670,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False

Tools to visualize viral RNA directly in infected cells are critical to analyze its replication cycle, screen for therapeutic molecules or study infections in human tissue. Here, we report the design, validation and initial application of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes to visualize positive or negative RNA of SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaFISH). We demonstrate sensitive visualization of vRNA in African green monkey and several human cell lines, in patient samples and human tissue.

455,"Targeted in situ cross-linking mass spectrometry and integrative modeling reveal the architectures of Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nucleocapsid proteins from SARS-CoV-2","Atomic structures of several proteins from the coronavirus family are still partial or unavailable. A possible reason for this gap is the instability of these proteins outside of the cellular context, thereby prompting the use of in-cell approaches. In situ cross-linking and mass spectrometry (in situ CLMS) can provide information on the structures of such proteins as they occur in the intact cell. Here, we applied targeted in situ CLMS to structurally probe Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins from SARS-CoV-2, and obtained cross-link sets with an average density of one cross-link per twenty residues. We then employed integrative modeling that computationally combined the cross-linking data with domain structures to determine full-length atomic models. For the Nsp2, the cross-links report on a complex topology with long-range interactions. Integrative modeling with structural prediction of individual domains by the AlphaFold2 system allowed us to generate a single consistent all-atom model of the full-length Nsp2. The model reveals three putative metal binding sites, and suggests a role for Nsp2 in zinc regulation within the replication-transcription complex. For the N protein, we identified multiple intra- and inter-domain cross-links.

456,Bronchoalveolar lavage affects thorax computed tomography of healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),"Medical imaging as method to assess the longitudinal process of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates is commonly used in research settings. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is also regularly used to determine the local virus production and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract. However, the potential interference of those two diagnostic modalities with each other is unknown in non-human primates. The current study investigated the effect and duration of BAL on computed tomography (CT) in both healthy and experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). In addition, the effect of subsequent BALs was reviewed. Thorax CTs and BALs were obtained from four healthy animals and 11 experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. From all animals, CTs were obtained just before BAL, and 24 hours post-BAL. Additionally, from the healthy animals, CTs immediately after and four hours post-BAL were obtained. Thorax CTs were evaluated for alterations in lung density, measured in Hounsfield units, and a visual semi-quantitative scoring system. An increase in the lung density was observed on the immediately post-BAL CT but resolved within 24 hours in the healthy animals. In the infected animals, a significant difference in both the lung density and CT score was still found 24 hours after BAL. Furthermore, the differences between timepoints in CT score were increased for the second BAL. These results indicate that the effect of BAL on infected lungs is not completed within the first 24 hours. Therefore, it is of importance to acknowledge the interference between BAL and CT in rhesus macaques.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429761,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429761,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
457,Type-I interferon signatures in SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7 cells,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global health emergency. A key feature of COVID-19 is dysregulated interferon-response. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is one of the earliest antiviral innate immune responses following viral infection and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, using a proteomics-based approach, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces delayed and dysregulated IFN-I signaling in Huh7 cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to inhibit RIG-I mediated IFN-{beta} production. Our results also confirm the recent findings that IFN-I pretreatment is able to reduce susceptibility of Huh7 cells to SARS-CoV-2, but not post-treatment. Moreover, senescent Huh7 cells, in spite of showing accentuated IFN-I response were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the virus effectively inhibited IFIT1 in these cells. Finally, proteomic comparison between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV revealed a distinct differential regulatory signature of interferon-related proteins emphasizing that therapeutic strategies based on observations in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should be used with caution. Our findings provide a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 regulation of cellular interferon response and a perspective on its use as a treatment.

458,Large-scale analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein mutants demonstrates the need for continuous screening of virus isolates,"Due to the widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is evolving in diverse human populations. Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it.

We analyzed 146,920 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 2,393 NGS datasets from GISAID, NCBI Virus and NCBI SRA archives focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 13.6% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.98% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 2,592 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only nine and 23 recurrent variants were found in at least 0.5% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 15.1% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition.

459,Site-specific O-glycosylation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produced in insect and human cells,"Enveloped viruses hijack not only the host translation processes, but also its glycosylation machinery, and to a variable extent cover viral surface proteins with tolerogenic host-like structures. SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S - insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complementary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.",Ieva Bagdonaite; Andrew J.

460,Extensive recombination-driven coronavirus diversification expands the pool of potential pandemic pathogens,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the third zoonotic coronavirus identified in the last twenty years. Previously, four other known coronaviruses moved from animal reservoirs into humans and now cause primarily mild-to-moderate respiratory disease. The emergence of these viruses likely involved a period of intense transmission before becoming endemic, highlighting the recurrent threat to human health posed by animal coronaviruses. Enzootic and epizootic coronaviruses of diverse lineages pose a significant threat to livestock, as most recently observed for virulent strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and swine acute diarrhea-associated coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Unique to RNA viruses, coronaviruses encode a proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) that lowers point mutation rates to increase the viability of large RNA virus genomes, which comes with the cost of limiting virus adaptation via point mutation. This limitation can be overcome by high rates of recombination that facilitate rapid increases in genetic diversification. To compare dynamics of recombination between related sequences, we developed an open-source computational workflow (IDPlot) to measure nucleotide identity, locate recombination breakpoints, and infer phylogenetic relationships. We analyzed recombination dynamics among three groups of coronaviruses with impacts on livestock or human health: SARSr-CoV, Betacoronavirus-1, and SADSr-CoV. We found that all three groups undergo recombination with highly diverged viruses, disrupting phylogenetic relationships and revealing contributions of unknown coronavirus lineages to the genetic diversity of established groups. Dynamic patterns of recombination impact inferences of relatedness between diverse coronaviruses and expand the genetic pool that may contribute to future zoonotic events. These results illustrate the limitations of current sampling approaches for anticipating zoonotic threats to human and animal health.",Stephen A. Goldstein; Joe Brown; Brent S Pedersen; Aaron R.

461,Codon arrangement modulates MHC-I peptides presentation: implications for a SARS-CoV-2 peptide-based vaccine,"Among various vaccination strategies, peptide-based vaccines appear as excellent candidates because they are cheap to produce, are highly stable and harbor low toxicity. However, predicting which MHC-I Associated Peptide (MAP) will ultimately reach cell surface remains challenging, due to high false discovery rates. Previously, we demonstrated that synonymous codon arrangement (usage and placement) is predictive of, and modulates MAP presentation. Here, we apply CAMAP (Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor), the artificial neural network we used to unveil the role of codon arrangement in MAP presentation, to predict SARS-CoV MAPs. We report that experimentally identified SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 MAPs are associated with significantly higher CAMAP scores. Based on CAMAP scores and binding affinity, we identified 48 non-overlapping MAP candidates for a peptide-based vaccine, ensuring coverage for a high proportion of HLA haplotypes in the US population (>78%) and SARS-CoV-2 strains (detected in >98% of SARS-CoV-2 strains present in the GISAID database). Finally, we built an interactive web portal (https://www.epitopes.world) where researchers can freely explore CAMAP predictions for SARS-CoV-1/2 viruses. Collectively, we present an analysis framework that can be generalizable to empower the rapid identification of virus-specific MAPs, including in the context of an emergent virus, to help accelerate target identification for peptide-based vaccine designs that could be critical in safely attaining group immunity in the context of a global pandemic.",Tariq Daouda; Maude Dumont-Lagacé; Albert Feghaly; Alexandra-Chloe Villani,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429819,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429819,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
462,"Follow-up of a hospital cohort during the first 3,530 suspected cases of COVID-19 in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil","IntroductionIn a global context, COVID-19 is the most significant health threat in the present days, evidenced by the fact that, in just over four months, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 171 countries, reaching a Pandemic status. Most patients with COVID-19 have a mild course of the disease. However, approximately 20% develop severe illness with a high mortality rate which is associated with age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. Epidemiological studies are used to reveal the extent of viral spread in homes, communities, and hospitals. Thus, preventive and control measures can be established by the authorities.

ObjectiveIn this study, patients with suspect COVID-19 symptoms who search for hospital care at the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto (Sao Paulo, Brazil) were monitored, in order to identify the first case of this new disease in the region. In the first two months (March and April), more than 3000 individuals looked for the public and private health system with suspected respiratory symptoms, but only 164 (8.4%) were COVID-19 confirmed.

ResultsFrom those, males (56.1%) and patients of the age distribution of 16-59 (91.2%), with diarrhea (22.2%), runny nose (25%), altered taste (15.9%), and anosmia (11.6%) presented statistical significance, although none comorbidities were related with COVID-19 occurrence. The odds ratio analysis supports this finding.

To date, little is known about the roles of ER stress, UPR, and autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we over-expressed the viral Spike (S) protein in cultured HEK293T cells, as it has been shown that such protein is largely responsible for UPR activation in other CoV-infected cells. We noticed, in the transfected cells, heightened ER stress, activation of the PERK-eIF2 arm of the UPR, induction of autophagy and cell death. When we treated the transfected cells with Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), 4-phenyl butyric acid (PBA), Salubrinal, Trazadone hydrochloride, and Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), we saw reduced the BiP/GRP78 levels, but only PBA and TUDCA could significantly diminish the levels of peIF2 and autophagy expression.",Bijina Balakrishnan; Kent Lai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429769,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.429769,2021-02-04,2021-02-04,,False
464,IN-HOSPITAL CONTINUATION WITH ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER MORTALITY RATE THAN CONTINUATION WITH ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS IN COVID-19 PATIENTS A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY,"BackgroundSeveral studies have reported a reduced risk of death associated with the inpatient use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in COVID-19 patients, but have been criticized for incurring in several types of bias. Also, most studies have pooled ACEIs and ARBs as if they were a unique group, overlooking their pharmacological differences. We aimed to assess whether the in-hospital continuation of ARBs and ACEIs, in regular users of these drugs, was associated with a reduced risk of death as compared to their discontinuation and also to compare head-to-head ARBs with ACEIs.

MethodsAdult patients with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission during March, 2020 were consecutively selected from 7 hospitals in Madrid, Spain. Among them, we identified outpatient users of ACEIs/ARBs and divided them in two cohorts depending on treatment discontinuation/continuation at admission. Then, they were followed-up until discharge or in-hospital death. An intention-to-treat survival analysis was carried out and hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95%CI were computed through a Cox regression model adjusted for propensity scores of discontinuation and controlled by potential mediators.

ResultsOut of 625 ACEI/ARB users, 340(54.4%) discontinued treatment. The in-hospital mortality rates were 27.6% and 27.7% in discontinuation and continuation cohorts, respectively (HR=1.01; 95%CI:0.70-1.46). No difference in mortality was observed between ARB and ACEI discontinuation (28.6% vs. 27.1%, respectively), while a significantly lower mortality rate was found among patients who continued with ARBs (20.8%,N=125) as compared to those who continued with ACEIs (33.1%,N=136; p=0.03). The head-to-head comparison (ARB vs. ACEI continuation) yielded an adjusted HR of 0.52 (95%CI:0.29-0.93), being especially notorious among males (HR=0.34; 95%CI:0.12-0.93), subjects older than 74 years (HR=0.46; 95%CI:0.25-0.85), and patients with obesity (HR=0.22; 95%CI:0.05-0.94), diabetes (HR=0.36; 95%CI:0.13-0.97) and heart failure (HR=0.12; 95%CI:0.03-0.97).

ConclusionsAmong regular users of ARBs admitted for COVID-19, the in-hospital continuation with them was associated with an improved survival, while this was not observed with ACEIs. Regular users of ARBs should continue with this treatment if admitted for COVID-19, unless medically contraindicated. In admitted ACEI users, a switching to ARBs should be considered, especially among high-risk patients.

465,Stay Home and Stay Active? The impact of stay-at-home restrictions on physical activity routines in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Government restrictions applied during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK led to the disruption of many peoples physical activity routines, with sports and leisure facilities closed and outdoor exercise only permitted once per day. In this study we investigated which population groups were impacted most in terms of reduced physical activity levels during these periods, and which groups benefitted in terms of increasing their usual level of physical activity. We surveyed UK residents, sampled through users of a rewards-for-exercise app (Sweatcoin; n=749) and an online panel (Prolific; n=907). Of the app users, n=487 further provided daily step-count data collected by the app, prior to, and during the periods of restrictions between March and June 2020. Regression models were applied to investigate factors associated with subjective change (perceived change in physical activity) and objective change (log-percentage change in daily step-count) in physical activity during the periods of restrictions. ANOVAs were used to further investigate the significant factors identified. Key factors associated with a substantial subjective reduction in physical activity included those classed as obese, gym users and people living in urban areas. All participants had a reduced step count during restrictions, with Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, students and urban dwellers showing the largest reductions. Therefore, targeted interventions are required to ensure that the physical and mental health impacts of sedentary behaviour are not exacerbated over the long-term by significant reductions in physical activity identified in these groups, particularly those who are also more vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus.",Victoria Eshelby; Muhammed Sogut; Kate Jolly; Ivo Vlaev; Mark T Elliott,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250863,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250863,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
466,Returning to a normal life via COVID-19 vaccines in the USA: a large-scale agent-based simulation study,"BackgroundIn 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 300,000 deaths in the US alone. While non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the USA, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the FDA approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy is renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nation-wide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown.

ObjectiveWe study the effectiveness of a nation-wide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines, through six scenarios that capture a range of possible impact from non-pharmaceutical interventions.

MethodsWe use large-scale cloud-based agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using Covasim, an open-source ABM for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity as well as a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose six non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth is fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates are recorded.

ResultsFor both vaccination plans and all non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low at 20%. We noted an unintended consequence: given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections.

ConclusionsAlthough potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Non-pharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance, so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.",Junjiang Li; Philippe Giabbanelli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250872,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.31.21250872,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True

These environments include provisional testing facilities, lacking temperature control; as outside temperatures fall, recommended testing temperatures cannot be guaranteed. We report impaired specificity in two out of six Ag-RDTs when used at 2-4{degrees}C, indicating that testing in cold settings might cause false-positive results potentially entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments and incorrect incidence estimates.",Verena Claudia Haage; Andres Moreira-Soto; Jilian A.

468,Bayesian Calibration of Using CO2 Sensors to Assess Ventilation Conditions and Associated COVID-19 Airborne Aerosol Transmission Risk in Schools,"Ventilation rate plays a significant role in preventing the airborne transmission of diseases in indoor spaces. Classrooms are a considerable challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic because of large occupancy density and mainly poor ventilation conditions. The indoor CO2 level may be used as an index for estimating the ventilation rate and airborne infection risk. In this work, we analyzed a one-day measurement of CO2 levels in three schools to estimate the ventilation rate and airborne infection risk. Sensitivity analysis and Bayesian calibration methods were applied to identify uncertainties and calibrate key parameters. The outdoor ventilation rate with a 95% confidence was 1.96 {+/-} 0.31ACH for Room 1 with mechanical ventilation and fully open window, 0.40 {+/-} 0.08 ACH for Rooms 2, and 0.79 {+/-} 0.06 ACH for Room 3 with only windows open. A time-averaged CO2 level < 450 ppm is equivalent to a ventilation rate > 10 ACH in all three rooms. We also defined the probability of the COVID-19 airborne infection risk associated with ventilation uncertainties. The outdoor ventilation threshold to prevent classroom COVID-19 aerosol spreading is between 3 - 8 ACH, and the CO2 threshold is around 500 ppm of a school day (< 8 hr) for the three schools.

Practical ImplicationsThe actual outdoor ventilation rate in a room cannot be easily measured, but it can be calculated by measuring the transient indoor CO2 level. Uncertainty in input parameters can result in uncertainty in the calculated ventilation rate. Our three classrooms study shows that the estimated ventilation rate considering various input parameters uncertainties is between {+/-} 8-20 %. As a result, the uncertainty of the ventilation rate contributes to the estimated COVID-19 airborne aerosol infection risks uncertainty up to {+/-} 10 %. Other studies can apply the proposed Bayesian and MCMC method to estimating building ventilation rates and airborne aerosol infection risks based on actual measurement data such as CO2 levels with uncertainties and sensitivity of input parameters identified. The outdoor ventilation rate and CO2 threshold values as functions of exposure times could be used as the baseline models to develop correlations to be implemented by cheap/portable sensors to be applied in similar situations to monitor ventilation conditions and airborne risk levels.",Danlin Hou; Ali Katal; Liangzhu (Leon) Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250791,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.29.21250791,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
469,Towards a COVID-19 symptom triad: The importance of symptom constellations in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"Pandemic scenarios like SARS-Cov-2 require rapid information aggregation. In the age of eHealth and data-driven medicine, publicly available symptom tracking tools offer efficient and scalable means of collecting and analyzing large amounts of data. As a result, information gains can be communicated to front-line providers. We have developed such an application in less than a month and reached more than 500 thousand users within 48 hours. The dataset contains information on basic epidemiological parameters, symptoms, risk factors and details on previous exposure to a COVID-19 patient. Exploratory Data Analysis revealed different symptoms reported by users with confirmed contacts vs. no confirmed contacts. The symptom combination of anosmia, cough and fatigue was the most important feature to differentiate the groups, while single symptoms such as anosmia, cough or fatigue alone were not sufficient. A linear regression model from the literature using the same symptom combination as features was applied on all data. Predictions matched the regional distribution of confirmed cases closely across Germany, while also indicating that the number of cases in northern federal states might be higher than officially reported. In conclusion, we report that symptom combinations anosmia, fatigue and cough are most likely to indicate an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Leander Edwin Melms; Evelyn Falk; Bernhard Schieffer; Andreas Jerrentrup; Uwe Wagner; Sami Matrood; Jürgen R Schaefer; Tobias Müller; Martin Hirsch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250537,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250537,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
470,Optimal time to return to normality: parallel use of COVID-19 vaccines and circuit breakers,"By January 2020, the COVID-19 illness has caused over two million deaths. Countries have restricted disease spread through non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing). More severe ""lockdowns"" have also been required. Although lockdowns keep people safer from the virus, they substantially disrupt economies and individual well-being. Fortunately, vaccines are becoming available. Yet, vaccination programs may take several months to implement, requiring further time for individuals to develop immunity following inoculation. To prevent health services being overwhelmed it may be necessary to implement further lockdowns in conjunction with vaccination. Here, we investigate optimal approaches for vaccination under varying lockdown lengths and/or severities to prevent COVID-19-related deaths exceeding critical thresholds. We find increases in vaccination rate cause a disproportionately larger decrease in lockdowns: with vaccination, severe lockdowns can reduce infections by up to 89%. Notably, we include demographics, modelling three groups: vulnerable, front-line workers, and non-vulnerable. We investigate the sequence of vaccination. One counter-intuitive finding is that even though the vulnerable group is high risk, demographically, this is a small group (per person, vaccination occurs more slowly) so vaccinating this group first achieves limited gains in overall disease control. Better disease control occurs by vaccinating the non-vulnerable group with longer and/or more severe lockdowns.",Michael Bonsall; Chris Huntingford; Thomas Rawson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250877,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250877,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
471,RAY: CRISPR diagnostic for rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV2 variants on a paper strip,"The COVID-19 pandemic originating in the Wuhan province of China in late 2019 has impacted global health, causing increased mortality among elderly patients and individuals with comorbid conditions.

Interestingly, several of these variants are point mutations that are difficult to diagnose using the gold standard quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method. This necessitates widespread sequencing which is expensive, has long turn-around times, and requires high viral load for calling mutations accurately. In this study, we show that the high specificity of Francisella novicida Cas9 (FnCas9) to point mismatches can be successfully adapted for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV2 infection as well as for detecting point mutations in the sequence of the virus obtained from patient samples. We report the detection of the mutation N501Y (earlier shown to be present in the British N501Y.V1, South African N501Y.V2, and Brazilian N501Y.V3 variants of SARS-CoV2) within an hour using paper strip chemistry. The results were corroborated using deep sequencing. Our design principle can be rapidly adapted for other mutations, highlighting the advantages of quick optimization and roll-out of CRISPR diagnostics (CRISPRDx) for disease surveillance even beyond COVID-19.",Manoj Kumar; Sneha Gulati; Asgar H Ansari; Rhythm Phutela; Sundaram Acharya; Poorti Kathpalia; Akshay Kanakan; Ranjeet Maurya; Janani Srinivasa Vasudevan; Aparna Murali; Rajesh Pandey; Souvik Maiti; Debojyoti Chakraborty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250900,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250900,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
472,Antibody seroprevalence and rate of asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2 in Austrian hospital personnel.,"ContextOn March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the current corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic. The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in Austria was announced on February 27, 2020. Since then, the incidence of infection followed an exponential increase until a complete lockdown in March 2020. Thereafter easing of restrictions was gradually introduced and until mid-August daily infections remained mostly below 5 per 100.000 population.

ObjectivesThe aims of this study are to determine i) how many employees in Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities have virus specific IgG and IgM, and/or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ii) how many are active virus carriers (symptomatic and asymptomatic) during the study, iii) the antibody decline in seropositive subjects over a period of around six months, and iv) the utility of rapid antibody tests for outpatient screening.

Study DesignOpen uncontrolled observational cross-sectional study.

Setting/ParticipantsA total of 3301 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) participated in the study.

Study Interventions and MeasuresRapid antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies, and RT-PCR tests based on oropharyngeal swab samples, as well as laboratory-based antibody tests using ELISA/PRNT were performed. The tests were conducted twice, with an interval of 42.4{+/-}7.7 (Min=30, Max=64) days. Additionally, participants filled out a questionnaire including questions related to personal health, traveling activities, living situation, as well as inquiries of symptoms and comorbidities. Antibody positive tested participants were re-tested with ELISA/PRNT tests at a third time point on average 188.0{+/-}12.8 days after their initial test.

ResultsIn our study cohort, only 27 out of 3301 participants (0.81%) had a positive antibody test at any time point during the study confirmed via neutralization test. Among participants who had positive test results in either of the antibody tests, 50.4% did not report any symptoms consistent with common manifestations of COVID-19 during the study period or within the preceding six weeks. In the group who tested positive during or prior to study inclusion the most common symptoms of an acute viral illness were rhinitis (21.9%), and loss of taste and olfactory sense (21.9%).

The rapid antibody test was generally more sensitive based on serum (sensitivity=86.6%) as compared to whole blood (sensitivity=65.4). Concerning both ELISA tests overall the Roche test detected 24 (sensitivity=88.9%) and the Diasorin test 22 positive participants (sensitivity=81.5%).

In participants with a positive PRNT, a significant decrease in PRNT concentration from 31.8{+/-}22.9 (Md=32.0) at T1 to 26.1{+/-}17.6 (Md=21.3) at T2 to 21.4{+/-}13.4 (Md=16.0) at T3 ({chi}2=23.848, df=2, p<0.001) was observed ({chi}2=23.848, df=2, p<0.001) - with an average time of 42.4{+/-}7.7 days between T1 and T2 and 146.9{+/-}13.8 days between T2 and T3.

ConclusionsDuring the study period (May 11th - December 21th) only 0.81% were tested positive for antibodies in our study cohort. The antibody concentration decreases significantly over time with 14.8% (4 out of 27) losing detectable antibodies.",Iris Leister; Elisabeth Ponocny-Seliger; Herwig Kollaritsch; Peter Dungel; Barbara Holzer; Johannes Grillari; Heinz Redl; Ivo Ponocny; Claudia Wilfing; Ludwig Aigner; Markus Exner; Michaela Stainer; Matthias Hackl; Thomas Hausner; Rainer Mittermayr; Wolfgang Schaden,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250898,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250898,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
473,One Year of Evidence on Mental Health in the COVID-19 Crisis - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"ObjectiveThis paper provides a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence rate of mental health issues of the major population, including general population, general healthcare workers (HCWs), and frontline healthcare workers (HCWs), in China over one year of the COVID-19 crisis.

DesignA systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesarticles in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and medRxiv up to November 16, 2020, one year after the first publicly known confirmed COVID-19 case.

Eligibility criteria and data analysisany COVID-19 and mental disorders relevant English studies with frontline/general healthcare workers, general adult population sample, using validated scales. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, distress, general psychological symptoms (GPS), insomnia, and PTSD and ran meta-regression to tease out the heterogeneity.

ResultsThe meta-analysis includes 131 studies and 171 independent samples. The overall prevalence of anxiety, depression, distress, GPS, insomnia, and PTSD are 11%, 13%, 20%, 13%, 19%, and 20%, respectively. The meta-regression results uncovered several predictors of the prevalence rates, including severity (e.g., above severe vs. above moderate, p<0.01; above moderate vs. above mild, p<0.01) and type of mental issues (e.g., depression vs. anxiety, p=0.04; insomnia vs. anxiety p=0.04), population (frontline HCWs vs. general HCWs, p<0.01), sampling location (Wuhan vs. non-Wuhan, p=0.04), and study quality (p=0.04).

LimitationsFirst, we only focus on China population, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Second, 96.2% studies included in this meta-analysis were cross-sectional. Last, since we only included studies published in English, we expect to have a language bias.

ConclusionOur pooled prevalence rates are significantly different from, yet largely between, the findings of previous meta-analyses, suggesting the results of our larger study are consistent with, yet fine-tune, the findings of the smaller, previous meta-analyses. Hence, this meta-analysis not only provides a significant update on the mental health prevalence rates in COVID-19 but also suggests the need to update meta-analyses continuously to provide more accurate estimates of the prevalence of mental illness during this ongoing health crisis. While prior meta-analyses focused on the prevalence rates of mental health disorders based on one level of severity (i.e., above mild), our findings also suggest a need to examine the prevalence rates at varying levels of severity. The one-year cumulative evidence on sampling locations (Wuhan vs. non-Wuhan) corroborates the typhoon eye effect theory. Our finding that the prevalence rates of distress and insomnia and those of frontline healthcare workers are higher suggest future research and interventions should pay more attention to those mental outcomes and populations.

474,How lifestyle changes within the COVID-19 global pandemic have affected the pattern and symptoms of the menstrual cycle.,"BackgroundThe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant changes to homes, working life and stress. The purpose of this research was to investigate the implications that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the menstrual cycle and any contributing factors to these changes.

MethodsA questionnaire was completed by 749 participants, whom ranged from  physically active to elite, in their training status. The questionnaire captured detail on menstrual cycle symptoms and characteristics prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period, as well as lifestyle, stress, exercise and nutrition. Descriptive statistics and frequency distribution were reported and decision tree analysis performed. Statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05.

ResultsFifty-two point six percent of females experienced a change in their menstrual cycle during the lockdown period. Psychosocial symptoms had changed in over half of all participants. Participants who reported increased stress/worry in family and personal health were significantly associated with changes in menstrual symptoms. Similarly, job security stress was associated with increases in bleeding time (p<0.05).

ConclusionsIt is important that females and practitioners become aware of the implications of stressful environments and the possible long-term implications on fertility, particularly given the uncertainty around a second wave of the global pandemic.",Georgie Bruinvels; Esther Goldsmith; Richard Blagrove; Dan Martin; Laurence Shaw; Jessica Piasecki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250919,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250919,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
475,"The effect of mobility restrictions on the SARS-CoV-2 diffusion during the first wave: what are the impacts in Sweden, USA, France and Colombia.","ResumeCombined with sanitation and social distancing measures, control of human mobility has quickly been targeted as a major leverage to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a great majority of countries worldwide. The extent to which such measures were successful, however, is uncertain (Gibbs et al. 2020; Kraemer et al. 2020). Very few studies are quantifying the relation between mobility, lockdown strategies and the diffusion of the virus in different countries. Using the anonymised data collected by one of the major social media platforms (Facebook) combined with spatial and temporal Covid-19 data, the objective of this research is to understand how mobility patterns and SARS-CoV-2 diffusion during the first wave are connected in four different countries: the west coast of the USA, Colombia, Sweden and France. Our analyses suggest a relatively modest impact of lockdown on the spread of the virus at the national scale. Despite a varying impact of lockdown on mobility reduction in these countries (83% in France and Colombia, 55% in USA, 10% in Sweden), no country successfully implemented control measures to stem the spread of the virus. As observed in Hubei (Chinazzi et al. 2020), it is likely that the virus had already spread very widely prior to lockdown; the number of affected administrative units in all countries was already very high at the time of lockdown despite the low testing levels. The second conclusion is that the integration of mobility data considerably improved the epidemiological model (as revealed by the QAIC). If inter-individual contact is a fundamental element in the study of the spread of infectious diseases, it is also the case at the level of administrative units. However, this relational dimension is little understood beyond the individual scale mostly due to the lack of mobility data at this scale. Fortunately, these types of data are getting increasingly provided by social media or mobile operators, and they can be used to help administrations to observe changes in movement patterns and/or to better locate where to implement disease control measures such as vaccination (Pollina & Busvine 2020; Pullano et al. 2020; Romm et al. 2020).",Olivier Telle; Samuel Benkimoun; Richard E.

476,"ABC2-SPH risk score for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients: development, external validation and comparison with other available scores","ObjectiveTo develop and validate a rapid scoring system at hospital admission for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), and to compare this score with other existing ones.

DesignCohort study

SettingThe Brazilian COVID-19 Registry has been conducted in 36 Brazilian hospitals in 17 cities. Logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a prediction model for in-hospital mortality, based on the 3978 patients that were admitted between March-July, 2020. The model was then validated in the 1054 patients admitted during August-September, as well as in an external cohort of 474 Spanish patients.

ParticipantsConsecutive symptomatic patients ([&ge;]18 years old) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 admitted to participating hospitals. Patients who were transferred between hospitals and in whom admission data from the first hospital or the last hospital were not available were excluded, as well those who were admitted for other reasons and developed COVID-19 symptoms during their stay.

Main outcome measuresIn-hospital mortality

ResultsMedian (25th-75th percentile) age of the model-derivation cohort was 60 (48-72) years, 53.8% were men, in-hospital mortality was 20.3%. The validation cohorts had similar age distribution and in-hospital mortality. From 20 potential predictors, seven significant variables were included in the in-hospital mortality risk score: age, blood urea nitrogen, number of comorbidities, C-reactive protein, SpO2/FiO2 ratio, platelet count and heart rate. The model had high discriminatory value (AUROC 0.844, 95% CI 0.829 to 0.859), which was confirmed in the Brazilian (0.859) and Spanish (0.899) validation cohorts. Our ABC2-SPH score showed good calibration in both Brazilian cohorts, but, in the Spanish cohort, mortality was somewhat underestimated in patients with very high (>25%) risk. The ABC2-SPH score is implemented in a freely available online risk calculator (https://abc2sph.com/).

ConclusionsWe designed and validated an easy-to-use rapid scoring system based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients commonly available at hospital presentation, for early stratification for in-hospital mortality risk of patients with COVID-19.

477,A Rapid Realist Review of the Role of Community Pharmacy in the Public Health Response to COVID-19,"IntroductionCommunity pharmacists and their teams have remained accessible to the public providing essential services despite immense pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have successfully expanded the influenza vaccination programme and are now supporting the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out.

AimThis rapid realist review aims to understand how community pharmacy can most effectively deliver essential and advanced services, with a focus on vaccination, during the pandemic and in the future.

MethodAn embryonic programme theory was generated using four diverse and complementary documents along with the expertise of the project team. Academic databases, preprint services and grey literature were searched and screened for documents meeting our inclusion criteria. The data was extracted from 103 documents to develop and refine a programme theory using a realist logic of analysis. Our analysis generated 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining when, why and how community pharmacy can support public health vaccination campaigns, maintain essential services during pandemics, and capitalise on opportunities for expanded, sustainable public health service roles. The views of stakeholders including pharmacy users, pharmacists, pharmacy teams and other healthcare professionals were sought throughout to refine the 13 explanatory configurations.

ResultsThe 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations are organised according to decision makers, community pharmacy teams and community pharmacy users as key actors. Review findings include: supporting a clear role for community pharmacies in public health; clarifying pharmacists legal and professional liabilities; involving pharmacy teams in service specification design; providing suitable guidance, adequate compensation and resources; and leveraging accessible, convenient locations of community pharmacy.

DiscussionCommunity pharmacy has been able to offer key services during the pandemic. Decision makers must endorse, articulate and support a clear public health role for community pharmacy. We provide key recommendations for decision makers to optimise such a role during these unprecedented times and in the future.",Ian D Maidment; Emma Young; Maura MacPhee; Andrew Booth; Hadar Zaman; Juanita Breen; Andrea Hilton; Tony Kelly; Geoff Wong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250765,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250765,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True

ACE2 is also the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. It has been hypothesized that following SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 internalization Ang II level would increase in parallel to a decrease of Ang-(1-7) in COVID-19 patients. In this preliminary report, we analyzed the plasma levels of angiotensin peptides in 19 severe COVID-19 patients and 19 non-COVID-19 volunteers, to assess potential outcome associations. Unexpectedly, a significant increase in circulating Ang-(1-7) and lower Ang II plasma level were found in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Accordingly, an increased Ang-(1-7)/ Ang II ratio was observed in COVID-19 suggesting a RAS dysregulation toward an increased formation of Ang-(1-7) in these patients.",Ana Luisa Valle Martins; Filipe Alex Silva; Lucas Bolais Ramos; Renata Cunha Ribeiro; Filippo Annoni; Alexandre Cardoso; Gisele Capanema Oliveira; Juliana Carvalho Martins; Daisy Motta Santos; Bruna Zivianni; Maria Jose Campagnole-Santos; Danilo Augusto Alves Pereira; Fabio Silvio Taccone; Thiago Verano Braga; Robson A S Santos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.20232785,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.20232785,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
479,Estimating the effectiveness of the Pfizer COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine after a single dose. A reanalysis of a study of 'real-world' vaccination outcomes from Israel.,"A distinctive feature of the roll out of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus in the UK was the decision to delay the timing of the second injection till 12 weeks after the first. The logic behind this is to protect more people sooner and so reduce the total number of severe infections, hospitalisations, and deaths. This decision caused criticism from some quarters due in part to a belief that a single injection may not give adequate immunity. A recent paper based on Israels experience of vaccination suggested that a single dose may not provide adequate protection. Here we extract the primary data from the Israeli paper and then estimate the incidence per day for each day after the first injection and also estimate vaccine effectiveness for each day from day 13 to day 24. We used a pooled estimate of the daily incidence rate during days 1 to 12 as the counterfactual estimate of incidence without disease and estimated confidence intervals using Monte Carlo modelling. After initial injection case numbers increased to day 8 before declining to low levels by day 21. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was pretty much 0 at day 14 but then rose to about 90% at day 21 before levelling off. The cause of the initial surge in infection risk is unknown but may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection. What our analysis shows is that a single dose of vaccine is highly protective, although it can take up to 21 days to achieve this. The early results coming from Israel support the UK policy of extending the gap between doses by showing that a single dose can give a high level of protection.",Paul R Hunter; Julii Suzanne Brainard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250957,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250957,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
480,COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters before and after pub lockdown,"AimTo study how different bans on serving alcohol in Norwegian bars and restaurants were related to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in bartenders and waiters.

MethodsIn 24,276 bartenders and waiters and 1,287,970 persons with other occupations (mean [SD] age 41.7 [12.8] years and 51.7% men), we examined the weekly rates of workers tested and detected with SARS-CoV-2, one to five weeks before and one to five weeks after implementation of different degrees of bans on serving alcohol in pubs and restaurants, across 56 Norwegian municipalities with: 1) full blanket ban, 2) partial ban with hourly restrictions (e.g. from 10 pm), or 3) no ban, adjusted for age, sex and testing behavior.

ResultsIn municipalities introducing full ban, COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters had been reduced by 65% by three weeks (from 3.4 [95%CI=2.5-4.3] to 1.2 [95%CI=0.7-1.7] per 1000), i.e. to the same levels as that for persons with other occupations (1.8 [95%CI=1.7-1.9] vs 1.2 [95%CI=1.1-1.3] per 1000). Similarly, in municipalities introducing partial ban, COVID-19 among bartenders and waiters had been reduced by 68% by three weeks (from 2.5 [95%CI=1.4-3.6] to 0.8 [95%CI=0.0-1.5] per 1000). However, there was more uncertainty to the estimated reduction for partial bans.

481,"Sarilumab treatment of hospitalised patients with severe or critical COVID-19: a multinational, randomised, adaptive, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BackgroundElevated proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity. We assessed efficacy and safety of sarilumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, in severe (requiring supplemental oxygen by nasal canula or face mask) or critical (requiring greater supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal support) COVID-19.

MethodsThis was a 60-day, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial in patients hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pneumonia, who required oxygen supplementation or intensive care. Patients were randomised 2:2:1 to intravenous sarilumab 400 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to [&ge;]2-point clinical improvement (7-point scale; range: 1 [death] to 7 [not hospitalised]). The key secondary endpoint was proportion of patients alive at day 29. Safety outcomes included adverse events and laboratory assessments. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04327388).

FindingsBetween March 28 and July 3, 2020, 420 patients were randomised; 416 received treatment (placebo, n=84; sarilumab 200 mg, n=159; sarilumab 400 mg, n=173). At day 29, there were no significant differences in median (95% CI) time to [&ge;]2-point improvement between placebo (12{middle dot}0 [9{middle dot}0-15{middle dot}0] days) and sarilumab groups (200 mg: 10{middle dot}0 [9{middle dot}0-12{middle dot}0] days, p=0.96, log-rank test; 400 mg: 10{middle dot}0 [9{middle dot}0-13{middle dot}0] days, p=0.34) or in proportions of patients alive (placebo, 91{middle dot}7%; sarilumab 200 mg, 89{middle dot}9%, p=0{middle dot}63; sarilumab 400 mg, 91{middle dot}9%, p=0{middle dot}85). At day 29, there were numerical, nonsignificant survival differences between sarilumab 400 mg (88%) and placebo (79%; difference +9%, 95% CI -7{middle dot}7 to 25{middle dot}5, p=0{middle dot}25) for critical patients. There were no unexpected safety signals.

InterpretationThis trial did not demonstrate efficacy of sarilumab in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and receiving supplemental oxygen. Adequately powered trials of targeted immunomodulatory therapies assessing survival as a primary endpoint are suggested in patients with critical COVID-19.

Currently, much is unknown about functionally neutralizing human antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2. Using convalescent sera collected from 101 COVID-19 recovered individuals 21-212 days after symptom onset with forty-eight additional longitudinal samples, we measured functionality and durability of serum antibodies. We also evaluated associations between individual demographic and clinical parameters with functional neutralizing antibody responses to COVID-19. We found robust antibody durability out to six months, as well as significant positive associations with the magnitude of the neutralizing antibody response and male sex. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent neutralizing antibodies are higher in individuals with cardio-metabolic comorbidities.

SignificanceIn this study we found that neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19 convalescent individuals vary in magnitude but are durable and correlate well with RBD Ig binding antibody levels compared to other SARS-CoV-2 antigen responses. In our cohort, higher neutralizing antibody titers are independently and significantly associated with male sex compared to female sex. We also show for the first time, that higher convalescent antibody titers in male donors are associated with increased age and symptom grade. Furthermore, cardio-metabolic co-morbidities are associated with higher antibody titers independently of sex. Here, we present an in-depth evaluation of serologic, demographic, and clinical correlates of functional antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2.",Alena Janda Markmann; Natasa Gaillourou; D.

483,Vaccinating Australia: How long will it take?,"The Australian Governments COVID-19 vaccine rollout strategy is scheduled to commence in late February 2021 and aims to vaccinate the Australian adult population by the end of October 2021. The task of vaccinating some 20 million people within this timeframe presents considerable logistical challenges. Key to meeting this target is the rate of vaccine delivery: the number of vaccine doses that can be administered per day. In the opening phase, high priority groups will receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine through hospital hubs at an initial rate of 80,000 doses per week. However, pending regulatory approval, the currently announced plan appears to be to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine to the bulk of the popluation through a combination of general practices and community pharmacies. Here, we run a series of projections to estimate how long it will take to vaccinate the Australian population under different assumptions about the rate of vaccine administration as well as the schedule for second doses and prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Our analysis highlights the ambitious rate of vaccine administration that will be neccessary to meet the Australian Government completion target of October 2021. A rate of 200,000 doses per day would comfortably meet that target; 80,000 doses a day would see roll-out extended until mid-2022. Speed is of the essence when it comes to vaccine rollout: protecting the population quickly will minimise the risk of sporadic and costly lockdowns lockdowns and the potential for small, local clusters getting out of control and sparking new epidemic waves. The government should gather all its resources to maximise the daily vaccination rate, ideally aiming to ramp up administration to at least 200,000 doses per day as quickly as possible. Quickly achieving and maintaining this pace will likely require dedicated large-scale vaccination sites that are capable of delivering thousands of doses a week in addition to the enthusiastic participation of GP practices and community pharmacies around the country. Lessons on the neccessary logistical planning, including coordination of delivery, ultra-cold-chain storage and staffing, can potentially be learned from Israel, where between 7,000 and 20,000 vaccinations per million population have been delivered daily throughout January.",Mark J Hanly; Tim Churches; Oisin Fitzgerald; Chandini Raina MacIntyre; Louisa Jorm,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250979,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250979,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
484,Increased hazard of death in community-tested cases of SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01,"VOC 202012/01, a SARS-CoV-2 variant first detected in the United Kingdom in September 2020, has spread to multiple countries worldwide. Several studies have established that this novel variant is more transmissible than preexisting variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity. We analyse a large database of SARS-CoV-2 community test results and COVID-19 deaths, representing 52% of all SARS-CoV-2 community tests in England from 1 September 2020 to 5 February 2021. This subset of SARS-CoV-2 tests can identify VOC 202012/01 because mutations in this lineage prevent PCR amplification of the spike gene target (S gene target failure, SGTF). We estimate that the hazard of death among SGTF cases is 58% (95% CI 40-79%) higher than among non-SGTF cases after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation level, care home residence, local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a male aged 55-69 increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% CI 0.8-1.0%) over the 28 days following a positive test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate a 71% (48-97%) higher hazard of death associated with VOC 202012/01. Our analysis suggests that VOC 202012/01 is not only more transmissible than preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants but may also cause more severe illness.",Nicholas G Davies; Christopher I Jarvis; - CMMID COVID-19 Working Group; W.

485,Epidemiological and evolutionary considerations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dosing regimes,"As the threat of Covid-19 continues and in the face of vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels. How timing of delivery of the second dose affects infection burden but also prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape are critical questions. Both hinge on the strength and duration (i.e. robustness) of the immune response elicited by a single dose, compared to natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short-term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection, evaluating how different second dose delays might drive immune escape via a build-up of partially immune individuals. Under certain scenarios, we find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose, and to ramp up vaccination efforts throughout the world.",Chadi M. Saad-Roy; Sinead E.

486,Changes in Characteristics of Opioid Overdose Death Trends during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background and AimsThere are limited reports analyzing opioid overdose (OD) mortality data during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also great heterogeneity in outcomes across states, necessitating assessments of the effects of COVID-19 on OD deaths on a state-by-state level. This report aims to analyze overall trends in OD deaths in Massachusetts during COVID-19.

DesignUsing individual-level death records in Massachusetts, we identified and analyzed OD mortality trends during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to 2018 and 2019. We analyzed the period between March 24 (stay-at-home order in 2020) and August 11 (latest reliable data). We also estimated the correlation between OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates at the county level.

SettingMassachusetts.

ParticipantsA total of 2,342 OD deaths were analyzed.

MeasurementsThe outcomes studied were OD deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates.

FindingsOD deaths involving cocaine and amphetamines increased from 2019 to 2020, by 20% (276 vs. 330; P<0.01) and 79% (33 vs. 59; P<0.01), respectively, but were steady from 2018 to 2019. Heroins presence continued to decrease (238 in 2018, 161 in 2019, 102 in 2020; P<0.001); however, fentanyl was present in more than 90% of OD deaths, reflecting its continued domination of the illicit opioid supply in Massachusetts. Prescription opioid presence was stable. 79% of OD decedents were White and 6% were Black in 2019, as compared to 74% and 10% in 2020 (P=0.01). We found no significant correlation between COVID-19 case fatality and OD death rates.

ConclusionsIncreased deaths involving stimulants and alcohol reflect concerning trends in the era of COVID-19. Rising OD death rates among Black residents underscore that interventions focused on racial equity are necessary.

487,Microscopic dynamics modeling unravels the role of asymptomatic virus carriers in SARS-CoV-2 epidemics at the interplay between biological and social factors,"The recent experience of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics spreading revealed the importance of passive forms of infection transmissions. Apart from the virus survival outside the host, the latent infection transmissions caused by asymptomatic and presymptomatic hosts represent major challenges for controlling the epidemics. In this regard, social mixing and various biological factors play their subtle, but often critical, role. For example, a life-threatening condition may result in the infection contracted from an asymptomatic virus carrier. Here, we use a new recently developed microscopic agent-based modelling framework to shed light on the role of asymptomatic hosts and to unravel the interplay between the biological and social factors of these nonlinear stochastic processes. The model accounts for each human actors susceptibility and the virus survival time, as well as traceability along the infection path. These properties enable an efficient dissection of the infection events caused by asymptomatic carriers from those which involve symptomatic hosts before they develop symptoms and become removed to a controlled environment. Consequently, we assess how their relative proportions in the overall infection curve vary with changing model parameters. Our results reveal that these proportions largely depend on biological factors in the process, specifically, the virus transmissibility and the critical threshold for developing symptoms, which can be affected by the virus pathogenicity. Meanwhile, social participation activity is crucial for the overall infection level, further modulated by the virus transmissibility.",Bosiljka Tadic; Roderick Melnik,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250926,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250926,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
488,Multi-modality detection of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal donor samples for transplantation and in asymptomatic emergency surgical admissions,"IntroductionFaecal transplantation is an evidence based treatment for Clostridiodes difficile. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to shed the virus in stool for up to 33 days, well beyond the average clearance time for upper respiratory tract shedding. We carried out an analytical and clinical validation of reverse-transcriptase quantitative (RT-qPCR) as well as LAMP, LamPORE and droplet digital PCR in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool from donated samples for FMT, spiked samples and asymptomatic inpatients in an acute surgical unit.

MethodsKilled SARS-CoV-2 viral lysate and extracted RNA was spiked into donor stool & FMT and a linear dilution series from 10-1 to 10-5 and tested via RT-qPCR, LAMP, LamPORE and ddPCR against SARS-CoV-2. Patients admitted to the critical care unit with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and sequential asymptomatic patients from acute presentation to an acute surgical unit were also tested.

ResultsIn a linear dilution series, detection of the lowest dilution series was found to be 8 copies per microlitre of sample. Spiked lysate samples down to 10-2 dilution were detected in FMT samples using RTQPCR, LamPORE and ddPCR and down to 10-1 with LAMP. In symptomatic patients 5/12 had detectable SARS-CoV-2 in stool via RT-qPCR and 6/12 via LamPORE, and in 1/97 asymptomatic patients via RT-qPCR.

ConclusionsRT-qPCR can be detected in FMT donor samples using RT-qPCR, LamPORE and ddPCR to low levels using validated pathways.

489,SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the healthcare setting into the home: a prospective longitudinal cohort study,"ObjectiveTo assess the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in healthcare workers and subsequent transmission to their close contacts within their household. To assess changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) and neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in exposed participants.

SettingTwo acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals within the East Midlands region of England.

BackgroundThe UK has been one of the most severely affected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission from healthcare workers to the wider community is a potential major vector for spread of SARS-CoV-2 which is not well described in the current literature.

MethodsHealthcare workers (HCW) were recruited from two Hospitals within the East Midlands of England and underwent serial blood sampling for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both nucleocapsid and spike protein for IgG, IgM and IgA) between 20 April and 30 July 2020, with the presence of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) assessed for positive participants. Cohabitees of the volunteers were invited to attend testing in July -August 2020 and underwent identical serological testing as the HCWs.

Results633 healthcare professionals were recruited. 178 household contacts of 137 professionals volunteered for the study. 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. The rate of symptomatic COVID-19 was 27.5% compared to an asymptomatic rate of 15.1%. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%).

7.2% of the cohabitees tested as seropositive. 58 cohabitees lived with a serologically positive HCW; this group had a seropositive rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees without a seropositive HCW, a six-fold increase in risk (Odds ratio 7.16 95% CI 1.86 to 27.59), p = 0.0025). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.

110 out of 115 (95.7%) HCWs and 12 out of 13 (92.3%) cohabitees who tested positive developed detectable nAbs. 56.5% (65 out of 115) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs developed a neutralising titre with an IC50[&ge;]1/300; no cohabitee achieved this level..

ConclusionsTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare professionals and their home contacts appears to be a significant factor of viral transmission, but, even accounting for the decline in seropositivity over time, less than 44% of adult cohabitees of seropositive healthcare workers became seropositive. Routine screening and priority vaccination of both healthcare professionals and their close contacts should be implemented to reduce viral transmission from hospitals to the community.

SUMMARY BOXESO_ST_ABSSection 1: What is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIHealthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the general population due, at least in part, to high levels of occupational exposure.
C_LIO_LIIgA, IgM and IgG are detectable for most patients after 11 days post SARS-CoV-2 infection but all decline in the weeks following SAR-CoV-2 exposure.
C_LIO_LIRates of transmission to healthcare workers, and therefore subsequent transmission to their close contacts, may be reduced with effective PPE.

Section 2: What this study addsO_LIThe amount of neutralising antibodies formed may be dependent on IgG response as it is much lower among seropositive cohabitees than seropositive healthcare workers.
C_LIO_LINHS Healthcare workers had a far greater seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population.
C_LIO_LICohabitees of positive healthcare workers have a 6-fold increased risk of developing serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population.
C_LIO_LIDespite this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed healthcare workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals to the wider community.

Research into contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for articles published between January 1 2020 and January 27, 2021 with the terms ""Covid-19"", ""healthcare workers"", and ""transmission"" ""home {NOT nursing} or household"". We did not restrict our search by language or type of publication. We identified 38 studies of which only one assessed the prevalence among HCW households using Canadian national databases. Our PubMed search yielded only one serological study within the German Healthcare system, which suggested very low transmission from healthcare workers to their close cohabitees.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the largest longitudinal serological cohort study assessing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the UK healthcare environment to the home (n = 633 healthcare workers, 178 cohabitees). Our findings showed that serological evidence within the HCW was high with 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. A cohabitee of a seropositive HCW had a six-fold increase of being seropositive themselves compared to a baseline rate of 2.5%. Despite this increased risk, transmission at home is less than 50% even from highly exposed healthcare workers, but remains an important potential vector of transmission from hospitals to the wider community. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%.

Implications of all available evidenceUnderstanding the transmission during the first wave from the healthcare setting into the home and the extent of such transmissions is essential to understand containment strategies of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants or to understand viral transmission of future respiratory viruses. NHS workers appeared to be at an increased risk of contracting of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the HCWs of other nations; we hypothesise that this may be related to a scarcity of appropriate personal protective equipment during the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the general population. An infected HCW, whether symptomatic or not, appears to be a significant bridge for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to their close home contacts.",Simon Craxford; Jessica Nightingale; Adeel Ikram; Ben Arthur Marson; Anthony Kelly; Alan Norrish; Amrita Vijay; Stuart Astbury; Lola Cusin; Waheed Ashraf; Jayne Newham; Guruprasad Aithal; Patrick Tighe; Jonathan Ball; Alexander W Tarr; Richard A Urbanowicz; Ana Valdes; Benjamin Ollivere,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250950,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250950,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True

The proposed multi-compartment model is expressed through a system of difference equations that describe their temporal dynamics. Various compartments in our model is connected to the social distancing measures and diagnostic testing rates. A nonparametric estimation strategy is employed for obtaining estimates of interpretable temporally static and dynamic epidemiological rate parameters. The confidence bands of the parameters are obtained using a residual bootstrap procedure. A key feature of the methodology is its ability to estimate latent compartments such as the trajectory of the number of asymptomatic but infected individuals which are the key vectors of COVID-19 spread.

Depression, anxiety and worsening of sleep quality have been reported in several recent articles that surveyed populations all over the globe. Our work meant to access, through a cross-sectional study, these disorders in the Brazilian population, through the application of an online questionnaire conducted on the second trimester of 2020.

Materials and MethodsWe applied an online questionnaire, filled with questions regarding social, economic, financial, educational and health status, as well as questions from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), and from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

ResultsWe collected 2,695 valid answers, from April 24th to May 31st, 2020. Age ranged from 18 to 79 years, mean of 31.3. Women were 76.3%, men 23.7%. Symptoms of Anxiety were found in 56.5%, of depression in 46.1%, and of bad sleep in 49.2%. Some groups were more prone than others to one or more of those conditions, such as: younger people, women, mestizos, Northeasterners, people with lesser years of education, of lower income or whose income dropped significantly during the pandemic, caregivers, students, sedentary or people practicing less physical activity, people who followed more hours of news of COVID-19 and those less engaged in social and instrumental activities.

Conclusionanxiety, depression and bad sleep quality were significantly high in our survey. Mental and sleep health is heterogeneously affected among individuals, depending on social, economic, financial, educational and health status.

O_TEXTBOXHIGHLIGHTS

- An online survey (DEGAS-CoV) was conducted between April 30th and May 31st, 2020, with people living in Brazil, aged 18 or more. The study obtained 2,695 valid answers.
- Rates of possible anxiety, possible depression and bad sleep quality were 56.5%, 46.1% and 49.2%, respectively. Rates are similar to another Brazilian survey, with 45,161 participants, conducted in a similar time window.
- Were more prone to mental and/or sleep conditions: younger participants, women, mestizos, unemployed, students, people with less years of education, people with lower income or with considerable drops of income during the virus outbreak, caregivers, people who followed more news of COVID-19, people less engaged in social and instrumental activities, smokers, sedentary or those who practiced less physical activity, and people who had symptoms suspected (confirmed or not) of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- Alcohol drinkers were slightly less likely to be possibly depressed. That finding needs more clarification and may be due to confounders.

492,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and associated outcomes: results from an ongoing prospective cohort study, New York City","BackgroundIn May-July 2020 in the New York City area, up to 16% of pregnant women had reportedly been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Prior studies found associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and certain adverse outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, cesarean delivery). These studies relied on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection. This led to overrepresentation of symptomatic or acutely ill cases in scientific studies.

ObjectiveTo expand our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes, regardless of symptomatology and stage of infection, by using serological tests to measure IgG antibody levels.

Study DesignThe Generation C Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted at the Mount Sinai Health System. All pregnant women receiving obstetrical care at the Mount Sinai Hospital and Mount Sinai West Hospital from April 20, 2020 onwards are eligible for participation. For the current analysis, we included participants who had given birth to a liveborn singleton infant on or before August 15, 2020. Blood was drawn as part of routine clinical care; for each woman, we tested the latest sample available to establish seropositivity using a SARS-CoV-2 serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, RT-PCR testing was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab taken during labor and delivery. Pregnancy outcomes of interest (i.e., gestational age at delivery, birth weight, mode of delivery, Apgar score, ICU/NICU admission, and neonatal hospital length of stay) and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Among all Generation C participants who had given birth by August 15, 2020 (n=708), we established the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Excluding women who tested RT-PCR positive at delivery, we conducted crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression models to compare antibody positive women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery with antibody negative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. We stratified analyses by race/ethnicity to examine potential effect modification.

ResultsThe SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on IgG measurement was 16.4% (n=116, 95% CI 13.7-19.3). Twelve women (1.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at delivery (11 of these women were seropositive). Seropositive women were generally younger, more often Black or Hispanic, and more often had public insurance and higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared with seronegative women. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity without RT-PCR positivity at delivery was associated with decreased odds of caesarean delivery (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.27; 0.84) compared with seronegative women without RT-PCR positivity at delivery. Stratified by race/ethnicity, the association between seropositivity and decreased odds of caesarean delivery remained for non-Hispanic Black/African-American and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic White women. No other pregnancy outcomes differed by seropositivity, overall or stratified by race/ethnicity.

ConclusionSeropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 without RT-PCR positivity at delivery, suggesting that infection occurred earlier during pregnancy, was not associated with selected adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among live births in a cohort sample of women from New York City. While non-Hispanic Black and Latina women in our cohort had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity compared with non-Hispanic White women, we found no increase in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among these groups due to infection.",Nina M Molenaar; Anna-Sophie Rommel; Lotje de Witte; Siobhan Dolan; Whitney Lieb; Erona Ibroci; Sophie Ohrn; Jezelle Lynch; Christina Capuano; Daniel Stadlbauer; Florian Krammer; Lauren Zapata; Rachel Brody; Rhoda Sperling; Omara Afzal; Roy Missall; Amy Balbierz; Teresa Janevic; Joanne Stone; Elizabeth Howell; Veerle Bergink,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250943,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250943,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
493,"Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 on college campuses: Initial efforts, lessons learned and research needs","BackgroundWastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging approach to help identify the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. This tool can contribute to public health surveillance at both community (wastewater treatment system) and institutional (e.g., colleges, prisons, nursing homes) scales.

ObjectivesThis research aims to understand the successes, challenges, and lessons learned from initial wastewater surveillance efforts at colleges and university systems to inform future research, development and implementation.

MethodsThis paper presents the experiences of 25 college and university systems in the United States that monitored campus wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 during the fall 2020 academic period. We describe the broad range of approaches, findings, resource needs, and lessons learned from these initial efforts. These institutions range in size, social and political geographies, and include both public and private institutions.

DiscussionOur analysis suggests that wastewater monitoring at colleges requires consideration of information needs, local sewage infrastructure, resources for sampling and analysis, college and community dynamics, approaches to interpretation and communication of results, and follow-up actions. Most colleges reported that a learning process of experimentation, evaluation, and adaptation was key to progress.

494,"Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in Monterey County, California","ImportanceEssential workers in agriculture and food production have been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding and antibody response in farmworkers in California.

DesignThis cross-sectional study collected survey data and determined current SARS-CoV-2 shedding and seropositivity among 1,107 farmworkers in Californias Salinas Valley from 16 July to 30 November 2020.

SettingFarmworkers receiving transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection at federally qualified community clinics and community sites were invited to participate in our study.

ParticipantsIndividuals were eligible if they were not pregnant, [&ge;]18 years old, had conducted farm work since the pandemic started, and were proficient in English or Spanish.

ExposuresSociodemographic, household, community, and workplace characteristics.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Current (as indicated by TMA positivity) and historical (as indicated by IgG seropositivity) SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsMost farmworkers enrolled in the study were born in Mexico, had primary school or lower levels of educational attainment, and were overweight or obese. Current SARS-CoV-2 shedding was associated in multivariable analyses with attained only primary or lower educational levels (RR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.99-1.76), speaking an indigenous language at home (RR=1.30; 0.97-1.73), working in the fields (RR=1.60; 1.03-2.50), and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 case at home (RR=2.98; 2.06-4.32) or in the workplace (RR=1.59; 1.18-2.14). Antibody detection was associated with residential exposures including living in crowded housing (RR=1.23; 0.98-1.53), with children (RR=1.40; 1.1-1.76) or unrelated roommates (RR=1.40; 1.19-1.64), and with a known or suspected COVID-19 case (RR=1.59; 1.13-2.24). Those who were obese (RR=1.65; 1.01-2.70) or diabetic (RR=1.31; 0.98-1.75) were also more likely to be seropositive. Farmworkers who lived in rural areas other than Greenfield (RR=0.58; 0.47-0.71), worked indoors (RR=0.68; 0.61-0.77), or whose employer provided them with information on how to protect themselves at work (RR=0.59; 0.40-0.86) had lower risk of prior infection.

495,"Scientists' opinion, attitudes, and consensus towards immunity passports","ObjectivesWe measured attitudes towards ""immunity passports"" in the context of COVID-19 of a large sample of scientists. Consensus of scientists opinions on a different aspect of immunity passports was assessed.

MethodsWe designed and implemented a survey to capture what scientists from around the world and different scientific background think about immunity certification. The survey was sent to the corresponding authors of scholarly articles published in the last five years in the top 20-ranked journals in each of the 27 subject areas between May and June 2020. Responses from 12,738 scientists were captured, and their distribution was tabulated by participants in health science and other fields. Consensus of responses was calculated using a variant of Shannon Entropy, made suitable for the ordinal response variables.

ResultsHalf of the scientists surveyed, regardless of academic background agree that a potential immunity passport program will be good for public health (50.2%) and the economy (54.4%), with 19.1% and 15.4% of participants disagree, respectively. A significant proportion of scientists raised concerns about immunity certification over fairness to others (36.5%) and social inequality (45.5%). There is little consensus in the different aspects of immunity passport among scientists. Overall, scientists with health background hold a more conservative view towards immunity certification.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest a lack of general agreement regarding the potential health and economic benefits, societal costs, and ethical issues of an immunity certification program within the scientific community. Given the relevant and important implications of immunity passport due to the increasing vaccine availability and efficacy, more attention should be given to the discussion of the design and implementation of immunity certification program.

Here we report the results of an Expanded Access Program of CPA in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. We evaluated the relationship between the timing of CPA and 28-day mortality in 4719 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Early ([&le;]3 days from admission) CPA was associated to decreased mortality in patients in the general ward and in the Intensive Care Unit not requiring mechanical ventilation.

497,SEVERE COVID-19 IS MARKED BY DYSREGULATED SERUM LEVELS OF CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A3 AND SEROTONIN,"The immune response plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from protection to tissue damage. This is observed in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome when elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines are detected. Several cells of the immune response are implied in this dysregulated immune response including innate immune cells and T and B cell lymphocytes. Mast cells are abundant resident cells of the respiratory tract, able to rapidly release different inflammatory mediators following stimulation. Recently, mast cells have been associated with tissue damage during viral infections, but little is known about their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we examined the profile of mast cell activation markers in the serum of COVID-19 patients. We noticed that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed increased carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3), and decreased serotonin levels in their serum. CPA3 levels correlated with C-reactive protein, the number of circulating neutrophils and quick SOFA. CPA3 in serum was a good biomarker for identifying severe COVID-19 patients, while serotonin was a good predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our results show that serum CPA3 and serotonin levels are relevant biomarkers during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that mast cells are relevant players in the inflammatory response in COVID-19, might represent targets for therapeutic intervention.",Rodolfo Soria-Castro; Yatsiri G.

498,Colchicine use in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"IntroductionColchicine may inhibit inflammasome signaling and reduce proinflammatory cytokines, a purported mechanism of COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to report on the state of the current literature on the use of colchicine in COVID-19 and to investigate the reported clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients by colchicine usage.

MethodsThe literature was searched from January 2019 through January 28, 2021. References were screened to identify studies that reported the effect of colchicine usage on COVID-19 outcomes including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, or mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroup of trial design (RCT vs observational) and ICU status. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately.

ResultsSix studies, reporting on 5,033 patients, were included in this review. Across the six studies, COVID-19 patients who had colchicine had a lower risk of mortality - HR of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.66) and OR of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.76). Among the three observational studies, COVID-19 patients who received colchicine had a lower risk of mortality - HR of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.66) and OR of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.71). Among three randomized controlled trials, the summary point estimate suggests a direction toward benefit in mortality that is not statistically significant among patients receiving colchicine versus placebo- OR of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.20, 1.24).

ConclusionColchicine may reduce the risk of mortality in individuals with COVID-19.

499,Deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human pancreatic cells,"COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 46 million people worldwide and caused more than 1.2 million deaths. It is transmitted by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and affects the respiratory tract as well as extra-pulmonary systems, including the pancreas, that express the virus entry receptor, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Importantly, the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, the latter composed of ductal and acinar cells, express high levels of ACE2, which correlates to impaired functionality characterized as acute pancreatitis observed in some cases presenting with COVID-19. Since acute pancreatitis is already one of the most frequent gastrointestinal causes of hospitalization in the U.S. and the majority of studies investigating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreas are clinical and observational, we utilized human iPSC technology to investigate the potential deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures containing endocrine and exocrine cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting iPSC-derived pancreatic cells, thus perturbing their normal molecular and cellular phenotypes. The infection increased a key inflammatory cytokine, CXCL12, known to be involved in pancreas dysfunction. Transcriptome analysis of infected pancreatic cultures confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the ribosomal machinery in these cells. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the pancreas is confirmed in post-mortem tissues from COVID-19 patients, which showed co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells and increased the expression of some pancreatic ductal stress response genes. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human iPSC-derived pancreatic cells with supporting evidence of presence of the virus in post-mortem pancreatic tissue of confirmed COVID-19 human cases. This novel model of iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures will open new avenues for the comprehension of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially establish a platform for endocrine and exocrine pancreas-specific antiviral drug screening.",Syairah Hanan Shaharuddin; Victoria L Wang; Roberta DeSouza Santos; Yizhou Wang; Harneet Jawanda; Yi Zhang; Wohaib Hasan; Gustavo L Garcia; Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami; Dhruv Sareen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250846,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250846,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True

We assessed mucosal antibody responses during primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 and examined their relationship with viral load and clinical symptoms. Elevated mucosal IgM was associated with lower viral load. RBD and viral spike protein-specific mucosal antibodies were correlated with decreases in systemic symptoms, while older age was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms. Up to 42% of household contacts developed SARS-CoV-2-specific mucosal antibodies, including children, indicating high transmission rates within households in which children might play an important role.",Janeri Fröberg; Joshua Gillard; Ria Philipsen; Kjerstin Lanke; Joyce Rust; Diana van Tuijl; Teun Bousema; Elles Simonetti; Christa van der Gaast-de Jongh; Mariska Bos; Frank J.M. van Kuppeveld; Berend Jan Bosch; Marrigje Nabuurs-Franssen; Nannet van der Geest-Blankert; Charlotte van Daal; Martijn A.

501,Rapid vaccination and early reactive partial lockdown will minimize deaths from emerging highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants,"The goals of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs are to maximally reduce cases and deaths, and to limit the amount of time required under lockdown. Using a mathematical model calibrated to data from King County Washington but generalizable across states, we simulated multiple scenarios with different vaccine efficacy profiles, vaccination rates, and case thresholds for triggering and relaxing partial lockdowns. We assumed that a contagious variant is currently present at low levels. In all scenarios, it rapidly becomes dominant by early summer. Low case thresholds for triggering partial lockdowns during current and future waves of infection strongly predict lower total numbers of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths in 2021. However, in regions with relatively higher current seroprevalence, there is a predicted delay in onset of a subsequent surge in new variant infections. For all vaccine efficacy profiles, increasing vaccination rate lowers the total number of infections and deaths, as well as the total number of days under partial lockdown. Due to variable current estimates of emerging variant infectiousness, vaccine efficacy against these variants, vaccine refusal, and future adherence to masking and physical distancing, we project considerable uncertainty regarding the timing and intensity of subsequent waves of infection. Nevertheless, under all plausible scenarios, rapid vaccination and early implementation of partial lockdown are the two most critical variables to save the greatest number of lives.",Daniel B Reeves; Chloe Bracis; David A Swan; Mia Moore; Dobromir Dimitrov; Joshua T Schiffer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250985,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250985,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
502,Extremely high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a strictly-Orthodox Jewish community in the UK,"BackgroundEthnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand how COVID-19 had spread within this community.

MethodsWe performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey specific to three antigen targets. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and gender. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres.

FindingsA total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres.

InterpretationIn this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required.

Research In ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSIn January 2020, we searched PubMed for articles on rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst ethnic minority groups and amongst the Jewish population. Search teams included ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", seroprevalence, ""ethnic minority"", and ""Jewish"" with no language restrictions. We also searched UK government documents on SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst minority groups. By January 2020, a large number of authors had reported that ethnic minority groups experienced higher numbers of cases and increased hospitalisations due to COVID-19. A small number of articles provided evidence that strictly-Orthodox Jewish populations had experienced a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection but extremely limited data was available on overall population level rates of infection amongst specific ethnic minority population groups. There was also extremely limited data on rates of infection amongst young children from ethnic minority groups.

Added value of the studyWe report findings from a population representative, household survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst a UK strictly Orthodox Jewish population. We demonstrate an extremely high seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 in this population which is more than five times the estimated seroprevalence nationally and five times the estimated seroprevalence in London. In addition the large number of children in our survey, reflective of the underlying population structure, allows us to demonstrate that in this setting there is a significant burden of disease in all age groups with secondary school aged children having an equivalent seroprevalence to adults.

Implications of the available evidenceOur data provide clear evidence of the markedly disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in minority populations. In this setting infection occurs at high rates across all age groups including pre-school, primary school and secondary school-age children. Contextually appropriate measures to specifically reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst minority populations are urgently required.",Katherine M Gaskell; Marina Johnson; Victoria Gould; Adam Hunt; Neil RH Stone; William Waites; Ben Kasstan; Tracey Chantler; Sham Lal; Chrissy h.

503,Effect of co-infection with parasites on severity of COVID-19,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in a spectrum of clinical presentations. The effect of co-infection with parasites on the clinical features of COVID-19 is unknown.

MethodsWe prospectively enrolled consecutive COVID-19 patients and screened them for intestinal parasitic infections. Patients were followed during hospitalization for clinical outcomes. Patients with parasitic co-infection were compared to those without parasitic co-infection. The primary outcome was the proportion of COVID-19 patients who developed severe disease. Factors associated with the development of severe disease were determined by logistic regression.

ResultsA total of 515 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for intestinal parasites, of whom 267 (51.8%) were co-infected with one or more parasites. Parasitic co-infection correlated inversely with COVID-19 severity. Severe COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients without parasites [47/248 (19.0%, CI: 14.52-24.35)] than in those with parasites [21/267 (7.9%, CI: 5.17-11.79)]; p<0.0001. There was a significantly higher proportion of patients who developed severe COVID-19 in the non-protozoa group [56/369 (15.2%, CI: 11.85-19.23)] as compared to the protozoa group [12/146 (8.2%, CI: 4.70-14.00)]; p=0.036. Significant higher proportion of the patients presented at baseline with severe COVID-19 in the helminth negative group [57/341 (16.7%, CI: 13.10 - 21.08)] than in the group with pre-existing helminth infection [11/174 (6.3%, CI: 3.51 - 11.11)]; p=0.001. In addition, after adjustment for age and presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 patients with any parasite co-infection [aOR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22-0.77); p=0.006], or with protozoa co-infection [aOR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.21-0.98); p=0.044] as well as those with helminth co-infection [aOR 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17-0.80); p=0.011] had lower probability of developing severe COVID-19 compared with those without parasite, protozoa or helminth co-infection.

ConclusionOur results suggest that co-infection with parasitic co-infection appears to be associated with reduced COVID-19 severity.

504,The role of the SwissCovid digital contact tracing app during the pandemic response: results for the Canton of Zurich,"ImportanceDigital proximity tracing (DPT) apps were released in several countries to help interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains in the population. However, the impact of DPT on pandemic mitigation still remains to be demonstrated.

ObjectiveTo estimate key populations and performance indicators along the DPT app notification cascade in a clearly defined regional (Canton of Zurich, using all of Switzerland as a comparison) and temporal context (September/October 2020).

DesignPublicly available administrative and research data, including key DPT performance indicators, SARS-CoV-2 testing statistics, infoline call statistics, and observational study data, were compiled. A model of the DPT notification cascade was developed and key performance indicators for DPT processes were defined. Subpopulation sizes at each cascade step were estimated using data triangulation. Resulting estimates were systematically checked for internal consistency and consistency with other up- or downstream estimates in the cascade. Stochastic simulations were performed to explore robustness of results.

ResultsFor the Canton of Zurich, we estimate that 537 app users received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in September 2020, of whom 324 received and entered a CovidCode. This triggered an app notification for an estimated 1374 proximity contacts and led to 722 infoline calls. In total, 170 callers received a quarantine recommendation, and 30 app users tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after an app notification, reflecting a performance above the national level.

Based on this quantification, key performance indicators were evaluated. For September 2020, these analyses suggest that SwissCovid triggered quarantine recommendations in the equivalent of 5% of all exposed contacts placed in quarantine by manual contact tracing. Per 11 CovidCodes entered in the app, we estimate that almost 1 contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon app notification.

However, longitudinal indicator analyses demonstrate bottlenecks in the notification cascade, as capacity limits were reached due to large increases in SARS-CoV-2 incidence in October 2020.

ConclusionAlthough requiring confirmation, our estimations on the number of notified proximity contacts receiving quarantine recommendations or testing positive after notification suggest relevant contributions to mitigating the pandemic. Increasing SwissCovid app uptake and improving notification cascade performance may further enhance its impact.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the real-life impact of Digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps on interrupting SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains?

FindingsThis data-informed simulation study found that, in the canton of Zurich, the number of app notified persons receiving a quarantine recommendation corresponds to the equivalent of up to 5% of all mandatory quarantined contacts identified by manual contact tracing. Furthermore, about 1 in 11 notification triggers led to SARS-CoV-2 testing of an exposed proximity contact who was consecutively tested positive.

505,A cautionary note on recall vaccination in ex-COVID-19 subjects,"Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines based on mRNA or adenovirus require a first jab followed by recall immunization. There is no indication as to whether individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 should be vaccinated, and if so, if they should receive one or two vaccine doses. Here, we tested the antibody response developed after the first dose of the mRNA based vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (BNT162b2) in 124 healthcare professionals of which 57 had a previous history of COVID-19 (ExCOVID). Post-vaccine antibodies in ExCOVID individuals increase exponentially within 7-15 days after the first dose compared to naive subjects (p<0.0001). We developed a multivariate Linear Regression (LR) model with l2 regularization to predict the IgG response for SARS-COV-2 vaccine. We found that the antibody response of ExCOVID patients depends on the IgG pre-vaccine titer and on the symptoms that they developed during the disorder, with anosmia/dysgeusia and gastrointestinal disorders being the most significantly positively correlated in the LR. Thus, one vaccine dose is sufficient to induce a good antibody response in ExCOVID subjects. On the contrary, a second dose might switch-off the immune response due to antigen exhaustion, which occurs in response to several viruses or drive the development of low-affinity antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 which may foster an antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) reaction when re-exposed to the virus. These results question whether a second shot in ExCOVID subjects is indeed required and suggest to post-pone it while monitoring antibody response longevity.",Riccardo Levi; Elena Azzolini; Chiara Pozzi; Leonardo Ubaldi; Michele Lagioia; Alberto Mantovani; Maria Rescigno,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250923,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.01.21250923,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
506,First indication of the effect of COVID-19 vaccinations on the course of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel,"Concomitantly with rolling out its rapid COVID-19 vaccine program, Israel is experiencing its third, and so far largest, surge in morbidity. We aimed to estimate whether the high vaccine coverage among individuals aged over 60 years old creates an observable change in disease dynamics. Using observed and simulated data, we suggest that the shape of the outbreak as measured by daily new moderate and severe cases, and in particular of patients aged over 60, has changed because of vaccination, bringing the decline in new moderate and severe cases earlier than expected, by about a week. Our analyses is consistent with the assumption that vaccination lead to higher than 50% protection in preventing clinical disease and with at least some effectiveness in blocking transmission of elderly population, and supports the importance of prioritizing vulnerable population. This is the first indication of the effectivity of COVID-19 vaccine in changing the course of an ongoing pandemic outbreak.

507,Quantifying meaningful adoption of a SARS-CoV-2 exposure notification app on the campus of the University of Arizona,"Digital exposure notification requires both the primary and secondary cases to have previously installed a smartphone application, and the primary case to rapidly report their positive diagnosis. These conditions were met for an estimated 12% of transmission pairs during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on the campus of the University of Arizona.",Joanna Masel; Alexandra Nicole Shilen; Bruce H Helming; Jenna Doucett Rutschman; Gary D Windham; Michael Judd; Kristen Pogreba Brown; Kacey Ernst,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251022,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251022,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
508,Association Between Preparedness and Response Measures and COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most disruptive global health threat in a century. We analyzed publicly available data on preparedness capacity, COVID-19 incidence and mortality, governance, and testing. Although other analyses have suggested that preparedness assessments do not correlate with effective pandemic response, we found that testing rates correlate with both COVID-19 incidence and mortality and strongly correlated with country preparedness capacity as measured by the Joint External Evaluation (JEE). There is a statistically significant association between preparedness capacities and COVID-19 case incidence and an independent association between governance and COVID-19 case and mortality rates. Legislation, surveillance, and risk communication capacities were associated with lower COVID-19 case incidence and mortality. Preparedness and governance are independently associated with COVID-19 pandemic severity. Preparedness capacities are not sufficient -- capacity and governance are both critical to pandemic control. Countries must improve public health systems and implement strong government leadership.

Article SummaryCountry preparedness capacities and country leadership policy response (governance) are both critically important to control pandemics. Without appropriate policy action, public health preparedness is insufficient for effective pandemic response.",Christopher T Lee; Marine Buissonnière; Amanda McClelland; Thomas R Frieden,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251013,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21251013,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,True
509,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on anxiety and depression symptoms of young people in the Global South: evidence from a four-country cohort study,"ObjectiveTo provide evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of adolescents and young adults who grew up in poverty in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs).

DesignA phone survey implemented August-October 2020 to participants of a population-based cohort study since 2002 comprising two cohorts born in 1994-5 and 2001-2 in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam. We examined associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, as well as structural factors (gender, location, wealth); and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, past household wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems and subjective well-being) measured at younger ages.

SettingA diverse, poverty focused sample, reaching those without mobile phones or internet access.

Participants10,496 individuals were approached, 9,730 participated. Overall, 8,988 individuals were included in this study, 4,610 (51%) male and 4,378 (49%) female. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data.

Main outcome measuresAt least mild anxiety and depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7, [&ge;]5) and Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8, [&ge;]5).

ResultsRates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) [95% CI, 38.63-43.12; (29.49-33.74)], and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) [95% CI, 8.16-10.58; (8.33-10.77)], mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Females were most affected in all countries but Ethiopia. In all countries, pandemic-related stressors were associated with increased rates of anxiety and depression, though with varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent and peer relationships were protective factors for mental health while having a long-term health problem or prior emotional problems were risk factors.

ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to the mental health of young people. Mental health support is limited in LMICs and young people have to date been lower priority for COVID-19 interventions.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThe study uses data from adolescents and young adults who grew up in poverty in four LMICs which were diversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore investigating a globally vulnerable, but understudied group both in terms of age and wealth.
C_LIO_LIThis study reaches a broad sample of young people who grew up in poverty, including those without internet or mobile phone access.
C_LIO_LIA key strength is combining a broad range of pandemic-related stressors from survey data on experiences of COVID-19 with previously measured information on longer-term risk and protective factors, therefore contributing to a more complete picture of COVID-19 effects.
C_LIO_LIA limitation of the study is that it does not have a directly comparable pre-COVID baseline for depression/anxiety, however, proxy variables are used as a baseline and the explanatory variables capture dynamics that happened during the pandemic.
C_LIO_LIA further limitation is possible underreporting due to stigma associated with mental health, despite piloting and validation, as well as possible bias in self-reported experiences of pandemic-related stressors due to feelings of anxiety or depression.
