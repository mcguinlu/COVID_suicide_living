0,Frailty and comorbidity in predicting community COVID-19 mortality in the UK Biobank: the effect of sampling,"Frailty has been linked to an increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated mortality, but evidence has been inconclusive and limited to hospitalized older individuals. Using data from the UK Biobank, we assessed whether frailty and comorbidity predict COVID-19 mortality in the overall community population (n=437,555) and in a selected COVID-19 positive sample (n=2,059). Frailty was assessed using the Rockwood Frailty Index (FI) and the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), whereas comorbidity was assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Overall, 408 individuals died of COVID-19, as ascertained from the death register data. In the full sample, HFRS (odds ratio [OR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.07) and CCI (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.08-1.20) were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, while FI was not statistically significantly different from null in the multivariable logistic regression model. Adding HFRS or CCI to a model with only age and sex resulted in significantly larger areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Nevertheless, when restricting the analyses to COVID-19 positive cases, which is a sample with over-representation of frail individuals, neither of the frailty measures or CCI added meaningful predictive accuracy on top of age and sex. Besides, we observed stronger associations between HFRS categories and COVID-19 mortality in relatively younger (<75 years) than older individuals ([&ge;]75 years). Our results suggest that HFRS and CCI, which could be readily derived from medical records, may be useful for COVID-19 mortality risk stratification in the community.",Jonathan K. L.

1,Pre-endoscopy SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy during COVID-19 pandemic: The care must go on,"Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopic societies have recommended reduction of endoscopic procedures. In particular non-urgent endoscopies should be postponed. However, this might lead to unnecessary delay in diagnosing gastrointestinal conditions. Methods: Retrospectively we analysed the gastrointestinal endoscopies performed at the Central Endoscopy Unit of Saarland University Medical Center during seven weeks from 23 March to 10 May 2020 and present our real-world single-center experience with an individualized rtPCR-based pre-endoscopy SARS-CoV-2 testing (""PECo"") strategy. Results: Altogether 359 gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed. The PECo strategy enabled us to conservatively handle endoscopy program reduction (44% reduction as compared 2019). The results of COVID-19 rtPCR from nasopharyngeal swabs were available in 89% of patients prior to endoscopies. Apart from six patients with known COVID-19, all other tested patients were negative. The frequencies of endoscopic therapies and clinically significant findings did not differ between patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 tests. Conclusion: A reasonable reduction of the endoscopy program in the setting of structured SARS-CoV-2 testing is feasible and safe. The PECo strategy allows continuation of endoscopic procedures in a region with intermediate frequency of COVID-19 when hospital capacities are not overwhelmed by the pandemic. Thus, the study might help to develop new strategies during future waves of COVID-19 or local outbreaks.",Markus Casper; Matthias C Reichert; Juergen Rissland; Markus Casper; Frank Lammert; Marcin Krawczyk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20217885,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20217885,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
2,The importance of the human factor during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: the successful case of the Italian strategy,"In Italy, 311364 cases and 35851 deaths of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were registered as of September 29th, 2020. To avoid the spreading of the virus, mathematical models predicting the course of infection spread1 become the basis to plan stringent countermeasures. We applied a published algorithm to real data up to September 27th, modeling two scenarios where predicted and real data were compared: a conservative scenario with a lockdown still ongoing and a scenario reflecting what actually happened in Italy, where the lockdown has been removed. Results revealed that the number of individuals in life-threatening condition is much lower than predicted, as well as the number of symptomatic individuals. Contrarily, the number of asymptomatic individuals is much higher than predicted. This suggest that human beings are not passive victims, but active fighters able to change the course of the infection creating adaptive strategies against the infection spread.",Cristina Scarpazza; Gianluca Musumeci; Andrea Sigfrido Camperio Ciani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20215277,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20215277,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
3,Challenges for non-technical implementation of digital proximity tracing: early experiences from Switzerland,"Background: Several countries have released digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps in addition to manual contact tracing (MCT) to combat the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. The goal of DPT is to notify app users about proximity exposures to persons infected with Sars-CoV-2 so that they can self-quarantine. However, early press reports from Switzerland suggest multiple challenges for non-technical DPT implementation. Objective: Using media articles published during the first three months after the DPT app launch to describe non-technical implementation challenges reported by different stakeholders and to map these reports to the four constructs of normalization process theory (NPT), a framework to develop and evaluate complex digital health interventions. Methods: A Swiss media database was searched for articles on the Swiss DPT app (SwissCovid) published in German or French between 04.07.2020 and 03.10.2020. Topics were extracted manually from articles that were deemed pertinent in a structured process. Extracted topics were mapped to NPT constructs. Results: Out of 94 articles deemed pertinent and selected for closer inspection, 38 provided unique information on implementation challenges. These challenges included unclear DPT benefits, which affected commitment and raised fears among different health system actors regarding resource competition with established pandemic mitigation measures. Moreover, media reports indicated process interface challenges such as delays or unclear responsibilities in the notification cascade, as well as misunderstandings and unmet communication needs from certain health system actors. Finally, some reports suggested misaligned incentives, not only for app usage by the public but also for process engagement by other actors in the app notification cascade. These challenges mapped well to the four constructs of NPT. Conclusions: Early experiences from one of the first adopters of DPT indicate that non-technical implementation challenges warrant attention. The detected implementation challenges fit well into the framework of NPT, which seems well suited to guide the development and evaluation of complex DPT interventions.",Viktor von Wyl,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20218057,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20218057,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
4,Fernando de Noronha: how an island controlled the community transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil,"Introduction: Fernando Noronha (FNA) is a small Brazilian archipelago in the Atlantic, part of the state of Pernambuco that COVID-19 has decimated. Anticipating the worst from the pandemic, Island and state authorities implemented a series of public health actions to contain the epidemic. This paper, reporting the results of the first wave of a cohort study, documents the measures and their effects through a cohort study. Methods: Measures were documented at the time of implementation. A random sample of 904 residents were selected from the health register, interviewed and tested for COVID-19 (RT-PCR and serology). The survey explored socioeconomic variables and adherence to prevention behaviors. Results: Flights were reduced from 38 to once a week, FNA was closed to tourism, schools were closed, and testing and tracing contacts was mandated along with social distancing and use of masks. A household lockdown was briefly imposed for residents. A prevalence of 5.1% was found, and a total of 158 cases of COVID-19 was estimated, although only 28 had been reported in routine surveillance. Half of the population reported food insecurity and applied for government COVID-19 benefits. Adherence to control measures was high, except for intrahousehold mask use with family and friends. Conclusion: Despite high levels of COVID-19 in Pernambuco, continued exposure through the provision of essential services from the mainland, and lack of direction from national authorities, FNA was able to implement a series of prevention measures unique in Brazil that contained the epidemic on the island.",Mozart Julio Tabosa Sales; Ligia S Kerr; Regina Vianna Brizolara; Ivana Cristina de Holanda Cunha Barreto; Rosa Livia Freitas Almeida; Paulo Goes; Luis Odorico Monteiro de Andrade; Leuridan Torres; Flavia Kelly Alvarenga Pinto; Francisco Marto Leal Pinheiro-Junior; Rebeca Valentim Leite; Amanda Carolina  Abreu Felix Cavalcanti de Abreu; Rebecca Lucena Theophilo; Fernando Rodrigues Magalhaes; Susane Lindinalva da Silva; Carl Kendall,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216010,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216010,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
5,Adaptive COVID-19 Forecasting via Bayesian Optimization,"Accurate forecasts of infections for localized regions are valuable for policy making and medical capacity planning. Existing compartmental and agent-based models for epidemiological forecasting employ static parameter choices and cannot be readily contextualized, while adaptive solutions focus primarily on the reproduction number. In the current work, we propose a novel model-agnostic Bayesian optimization approach for learning model parameters from observed data that generalizes to multiple application-specific fidelity criteria. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with SEIR-like compartmental models on COVID-19 case forecasting tasks. A city-level forecasting system based on this approach is being used for COVID-19 response in a few highly impacted Indian cities.",Nayana Bannur; Harsh Maheshwari; Sansiddh Jain; Shreyas Shetty; Srujana Merugu; Alpan Raval,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215293,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215293,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
6,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of UK healthcare workers,"Background There is an urgent need to understand the psychological impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on UK healthcare workers (HCW). Aims To reveal risk and protective factors associated with poor mental wellbeing of HCW working during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Method 2773 UK HCWs completed a survey between 22ndApril and 10th May 2020 containing scales measuring anxiety, depression, PTSD, and stress, and questions about roles and COVID-19-related factors including workplace preparation and risk management. Respondents were classified as high or low symptomatic on each mental health scale and logistic regression revealed risk and protective factors associated with each outcome. Change in wellbeing from pre to during COVID-19 was also quantified. Results A large proportion of UK HCW had high mental health symptoms. Fixed risk factors of poor mental health included being female, being frontline, pre-existing mental health diagnoses, and experience of stressful/traumatic events. An additional set of controllable factors also significantly increased risk: PPE availability, workload, lack of COVID-19 preparation and training, and insufficient communication of clinical procedures. Resilience and sharing stress reduced risk, as did ethical support for those making treatment decisions. Allied HCW and managers were at elevated risk of high symptoms particularly PTSD. Wellbeing, especially of frontline workers, had significantly worsened compared to before COVID-19. Conclusions Poor mental wellbeing was prevalent in HCW during the UK COVID-19 response. A number of controllable factors should be targeted, and protective factors promoted, to reduce the detrimental effect of COVID-19 and other pandemics on HCW mental health.",James Gilleen; Aida Santaolalla; Lorena Valdearenas; Clara Salice; Monserrat Fuste,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218396,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218396,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
7,Prediction and control of COVID-19 infection based on a hybrid intelligent model,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that emerged in the late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and it has caused a worldwide outbreak, which represents a major threat to global health. It is important to design prediction research and control strategies to crush its exploding. In this study, a hybrid intelligent model is proposed to simulate the spreading dynamics of COVID-19. First, considering the control measures, such as government investment, media publicity, medical treatment and law enforcement. The infection rates are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA), then a modified susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered (SIQR) model is proposed, then the long short-term memory (LSTM) is imbedded into the SIQR model to design the hybrid intelligent model to further optimize other parameters of the system model to obtain the optimal predictive model and control measures. This study provide a reliable model to predict cases of infection and death, and reasonable suggestion to control COVID-19.",Gengpei Zhang; Xiongding Liu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20218032,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20218032,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
8,Economic Benefits of COVID-19 Screening Tests,"We assess the economic value of screening testing programs as a policy response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the fiscal, macroeconomic, and health benefits of rapid SARS-CoV-2 screening testing programs far exceed their costs, with the ratio of economic benefits to costs typically in the range of 4-15 (depending on program details), not counting the monetized value of lives saved. Unless the screening test is highly specific, however, the signal value of the screening test alone is low, leading to concerns about adherence. Confirmatory testing increases the net economic benefits of screening tests by reducing the number of healthy workers in quarantine and by increasing adherence to quarantine measures. The analysis is undertaken using a behavioral SIR model for the United States with 5 age groups, 66 economic sectors, screening and diagnostic testing, and partial adherence to instructions to quarantine or to isolate.",Michael C Droste; James Stock; Andy Atkeson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20217984,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20217984,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
9,Socio-educational Impact and Psychological Distress of Medical Students amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Japanese Cross-Sectional Survey,"The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected medical education. However, few data are available about medical students' distress during the pandemic. This study aimed to provide details on how medical students had been affected by the pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, 717 medical students participated in the web-based survey. The questions included how their mental status had changed before and after the Japanese nationwide state of emergency (SOE). 65.9% (473/717) participated in the study. 29.8% (141/473) reported concerns about the shift toward online education, mostly because they thought online education could have been ineffective compared with in-person learning. Participant's subjective mental health status significantly worsened after the SOE was lifted (p <.001). Those who had concerns about a shift toward online education had higher odds of having generalized anxiety and being depressed (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.19 - 3.28), as did those who requested food aid and mental health care resources (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16 - 3.44; OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.07 - 6.15, respectively). Given our findings, the sudden shift to online education might have overwhelmed medical students. Thus, we recommend educators to inform learners that online learning is non-inferior to in-person learning, which could attenuate potential depression and anxiety.",Yoshito Nishimura; Kanako Ochi; Kazuki Tokumasu; Mikako Obika; Hideharu Hagiya; Hitomi Kataoka; Fumio Otsuka,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216572,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216572,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
10,Dexamethasone use and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: a Multicenter Retrospective Observational Study,"Objective: To examine the association between dexamethasone use and mortality among hospitalized patients for COVID-19. Design: Multicenter observational retrospective cohort study. Setting: Greater Paris University hospitals, France. Participants: 12,217 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 24 January and 20 May 2020, including 171 patients (1.4%) who received dexamethasone orally or by intravenous perfusion during the visit. Data source: Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was time to death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received dexamethasone and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for sex, age, obesity, current smoking status, any medical condition associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality, and clinical and biological severity of COVID-19 at admission, while stratifying by the need of respiratory support (i.e., oxygen or intubation). The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox model and the secondary analysis used a univariate Cox regression in a matched analytic sample. Results: Among patients who required respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 10 patients (15.9%) who received dexamethasone and 298 patients (26.4%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was a significant association between dexamethasone use and reduced mortality in both the crude, unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio (HR), 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.87, p=0.021) and the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.96, p=0.039). In the sensitivity analysis, the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample yielded a same tendency, albeit non-significant (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.14, p=0.077). Among patients without respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 14 patients (13.0%) who received dexamethasone and 1,086 patients (10.0%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was no significant association between dexamethasone use and the endpoint. When examining the association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone received during the visit and the endpoint, we found that the administration of a cumulative dose between 60 mg to 150 mg among patients who required respiratory support was significantly associated with a lower risk of death in the crude, unadjusted analysis (HR, 0.28; SE, 0.58, p=0.028), the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.24; SE, 0.65, p=0.030), and in the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample (HR, 0.32; SE, 0.58, p=0.048), whereas no significant association was observed with a different dose. Among patients without respiratory support, there was no significant association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone and the endpoint in the crude and in the adjusted multivariable analyses. Conclusions: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, dexamethasone use administered either orally or by intravenous injection at a cumulative dose between 60 mg and 150 mg was associated with decreased mortality among those requiring respiratory support.",Nicolas Hoertel; Marina Sánchez; Raphaël Vernet; Nathanaël Beeker; Antoine Neuraz; Jesús Alvarado; Christel Daniel; Nicolas Paris; Alexandre Gramfort; Guillaume Lemaitre; Elisa Salamanca; Mélodie Bernaux; Ali Bellamine; Anita Burgun; Frédéric Limosin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218172,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218172,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
11,Quantification of a Viromed Klinik Akut V 500 disinfection device to reduce the indirect risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by aerosol particles,"Indoor SARS-CoV-2 infections by droplets and aerosols are currently considered to be particularly significant. FFP2/3 respirator masks, which fit tightly and gap free, generally provide very good protection. In public transport, while shopping or in waiting rooms, they are therefore ideally suited to protect against direct and indirect infection. Unfortunately, these masks make it difficult to breathe and can be uncomfortable to wear in the long run. Therefore, these masks should be worn for a maximum of 3 x 75 minutes per day. These masks are therefore hardly suitable for schools or at work. The question therefore arises as to how people in closed rooms can be permanently protected from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Large safety distances provide both self protection and protection of third parties, but they do not protect against indirect infection if the virus load in the room is high. Mouth and nose covers only offer protection of others against direct infection, but they do not protect the user against indirect infection. The same applies to faceshields and small protective walls. Indirect infections can be effectively prevented by free ventilation with windows or air conditioning systems that supply 100% outside air into the room, provided the air exchange rate is at minimum six times the room volume per hour. However, free ventilation by means of windows is rarely efficient enough, and in winter at the latest, it is no longer possible to open windows without wasting massive amounts of energy and endangering the health and well-being of people. The operation of air conditioning systems is also very energy-intensive during the cold season. Furthermore, most buildings do not have air conditioning systems. The question is therefore, how a largely safe protection against an indirect SARS-CoV-2 infection can be realized in closed rooms without wasting thermal energy and thus valuable resources. Technically, the problem can be solved with mobile disinfection devices or room air cleaners that separate the dangerous aerosol particles or inactivate the viruses by UV radiation or by contact with charge carriers. The potential of these devices is great and, since many German manufacturers produce these devices, they are also available. However, many of the devices offered do not provide effective protection because the volume flow is too small, the separation efficiency of the filters is too low and the performance of the UV and ionization unit is too weak. The Viromed Klinik Akut V 500 disinfection unit appears to meet the performance requirements and therefore the device is analyzed and evaluated in this study for its suitability to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Christian J.

12,Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients in Georgia,"Objective: Describe presenting characteristics of hospitalized patients and explore factors associated with in-hospital mortality during the first wave of pandemic in Georgia. Methods: This retrospective study included 582 adult patients admitted to 9 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals as of July 30, 2020 (72% of all hospitalizations). Data were abstracted from medical charts. Factors associated with mortality were evaluated in multivariable Poisson regression analysis. Results: Among 582 adults included in this analysis 14.9% were 65+ years old, 49.1% were women, 59.3% had uni- or bi-lateral lung involvement on chest computed tomography, 27.1% had any co-morbidity, 13.2% patients had lymphopenia, 4.1% had neutophilosis, 4.8% had low platelet count, 37.6% had d-dimer levels of >0.5 mcg/l. Overall mortality was 2.1% (12/582). After excluding mild infections, mortality among patients with moderate-to-critical disease was 3.0% (12/399), while among patients with severe-to-critical disease mortality was 12.7% (8/63). Baseline characteristics associated with increased risk of mortality in multivariate regression analysis included: age [&ge;]65 years (RR: 10.38, 95% CI: 1.30-82.75), presence of any chronic co-morbidity (RR: 20.71, 95% CI: 1.58-270.99), lymphopenia (RR: 4.76, 95% CI: 1.52-14.93), neutrophilosis (RR: 7.22, 95% CI: 1.27-41.12), low platelet count (RR: 6.92, 95% CI: 1.18-40.54), elevated d-dimer (RR: 4.45, 95% CI: 1.48-13.35), elevated AST (RR: 6.33, 95% CI: 1.18-33.98).

13,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers of dedicated COVID hospitals and non COVID hospitals of District Srinagar, Kashmir","Background and objective: SARS-CoV-2 infection poses tremendous challenge to the healthcare system of nations across the globe. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers, which form a high-risk group, helps in identifying the burden of hidden infection in an institutional setting. Methods: We present the results of a cross-sectional serosurvey in healthcare workers from two different hospital settings based on their role in the management of SARS-CoV-2 patients in District Srinagar, Kashmir. In addition to testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, we collected information on influenza-like symptoms in the last four weeks and the status of RT-PCR testing. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies were detected in serum samples using a sensitive and specific chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology. Interpretation and Conclusion: Of 2915 healthcare workers who participated in the study, we analysed data from 2905 healthcare workers. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies was 2.5% (95% CI 2.0-3.1) in the healthcare workers of District Srinagar. Healthcare workers who had ever worked at a dedicated-COVID hospital had a substantially lower seroprevalence of 0.6% (95% CI: 0.2 - 1.9). Among healthcare workers who had tested positive for RT-PCR, seroprevalence was 27.6% (95% CI: 14.0 - 47.2).The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers of District Srinagar is low, reflecting that a high proportion of healthcare workers are still susceptible to the infection. It is crucial to lay thrust on infection prevention and control activities and standard hygiene practices by the healthcare staff to protect them from acquiring infection within the healthcare setting.

14,Evaluation of filtration efficacy of various types of face-masks using ambient and PAO aerosols following with different sterilization methods,"Due to the ongoing pandemic, various types of facemasks such as N-95, surgical mask and cloth masks are being used as an essential protective measure. The filtration efficiency of these masks were tested before and after sterilization by different methods for two flow rates conditions corresponding to normal breathe rate (20 lpm) and during sneezing (90 lpm). Sterilization techniques used here are autoclaving (30 and 60 minutes), dry oven heating (30 and 60 minutes), gamma irradiation (15 and 25 kGy), hot water washing with and without detergent and immersing in 10% concentration of liquid hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes. As expected, the N-95 is the greatest filtering efficiency among all the other type face masks. The best method to sterilize N-95 masks without affecting its performance is by using dry heat with temperature ranging from 70-80oC. The cloth masks and surgical mask are performed more or less same for both flow conditions. As an affordable sterilization method hot water washing is highly recommended which does not deteriorate the efficiency of the masks and can be used for the general public. The use of double or triple layer cotton cloth masks in the general public serves fit for the purpose than surgical masks. The surgical mask can be sterilized only few times with the help of dry heat, hot water wash and/or autoclave.",Amit Kumar; Basundhara Bhattacharjee; Sangeetha D.

15,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and associated factors in health care workers: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Health care workers (HCWs) represent a high risk population for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Aim: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs, and to find out the factors that are associated with this seroprevalence. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were applied for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including PubMed/MEDLINE and pre-print services (medR{chi}iv and bioR{chi}iv) were searched from inception up to August 24, 2020. Findings: Fifty studies, including 184,898 HCWs met the inclusion criteria. The estimated overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs was 8.4% (95% CI: 6.1-11.1%). Seroprevalence was higher in studies that were conducted in North America (12.7%) compared to those in Africa (8.2), Europe (8.1%) and Asia (4%). Meta-regression showed that increased sensitivity of antibodies test was associated with increased seroprevalence. The following factors were associated with seropositivity: male gender, Black, Asian, and Hispanic HCWs, work in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit, patient-related work, frontline health care workers, health care assistants, personal protective equipment shortage, self-reported belief for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous positive polymerase chain reaction test, and household contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs is high. Excellent adherence to infection prevention and control measures, sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment, and early recognition, identification and isolation of HCWs that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are imperative to decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Petros A Galanis; Irene Vraka; Despoina Fragkou; Angeliki Bilali; Daphne Kaitelidou,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218289,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218289,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
16,Abnormal liver tests in admitted patients with SARS-Cov-2 or other respiratory viruses- prognostic similarities and temporal disparities,"Background and Aims: Abnormal liver tests are common in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but their association with short-term outcomes is controversial. We aimed to compare the pattern of abnormal liver tests in SARS-CoV-2 patients with those of patients infected with influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), two non-hepatotropic respiratory viruses, and their association with in-hospital mechanical ventilation or death. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 1271 hospitalized patients (872 influenza, 218 RSV, and 181 SARS-Cov-2) in a tertiary medical center. We defined abnormal liver tests as GPT, GOT or GGT[&ge;]40IU/ML at any time-point during hospitalization. Results: Abnormal liver tests were mild-moderate in the majority of patients regardless of infection type but the majority of patients with influenza or RSV had a transaminases peak earlier during hospitalization compared to patients with SARS-Cov-2. Abnormal liver tests correlated with markers of severe disease across all types of infections, and were associated with mechanical ventilation or death, occurring mainly in patients with severe liver tests abnormalities (>200IU/L) (27.2%, 39.4% and 55.6% of patients with influenza, RSV or SARS-Cov-2). In multivariate analysis, controlling for age, gender, lymphopenia and CRP, liver tests abnormalities remained significantly associated with mechanical ventilation or death for influenza (OR= 3.047, 95% CI 1.518-6.117) and RSV (OR= 3.402, 95% CI 1.032- 11.220) but not for SARS-Cov-2 (OR= 0.995, 95% CI 0.198-4.989). These results were confirmed upon propensity score matching. Conclusions: Abnormal liver tests during hospitalization with different viral respiratory infections are common, may differ in their time-course and reflect disease severity. They are associated with worse outcomes, mainly in patients with severe liver test abnormalities, regardless of infection type.",Noa Shafran; Assaf Issachar; Tzippy Shochat; Inbal Haya Shafran; Michael Bursztyn; Amir Shlomai,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218230,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218230,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
17,Perceived Risk and Distress related to COVID-19: Comparing Healthcare versus non-Healthcare Workers of Pakistan,"Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) find themselves susceptible to contracting COVID-19 or being the source of exposure for their family members. This puts them at a high risk of psychological distress which may compromise patient care. In this study we aim to explore the risk perceptions and psychological distress between HCWs and non-healthcare workers (NHCWs) in Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Pakistan using an online self-administered questionnaire. Respondents were categorized into HCWs (completed or aspiring to complete education in Medicine or allied fields) and NHCWs. HCWs were further categorized into front-line (direct patient care) and back-end HCWs. Results Data from 1406 respondents (507 HCWs and 899 NHCWs) was analyzed. No significant difference was observed between HCWs and NHCWs perception of susceptibility and severity towards COVID-19. Healthcare graduates perceived themselves (66% students vs. 80% graduates, p-value 0.011) and their family (67% students vs. 82% graduates, p-value 0.008) to be more susceptible to COVID-19 than the healthcare students. Frontline HCWs perceived themselves (83% frontline vs. 70% back-end, p-value 0.003) and their family (84% frontline vs. 72% back-end, p-value 0.006) as being more susceptible to COVID-19 than back-end healthcare professionals. Over half of the respondents were anxious (54% HCWs and 55% NHCWs). Female gender, younger age and having COVID-19 related symptoms had a significant effect on the anxiety levels of both HCWs and NHCWs. Conclusion Frontline HCWs, healthcare students, young people, females and individuals with lower income were at a higher risk of psychological distress due to the pandemic. Government policies should thus be directed at ensuring the mental well-being of frontline HCWs, and improving their satisfaction in order to strengthen health care delivery system.",Dr. Adeel Abid; Dr. Hania Shahzad; Dr. Hyder Ali Khan; Dr. Suneel Piryani; Areeba Raza Khan; Dr. Fauziah Rabbani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218297,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218297,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
18,Online information on face masks in Italian and English websites: issues and responsibilities of search engines,"Countries have major differences in the acceptance of face mask use for the prevention of COVID-19. We analyzed 450 webpages returned by searching the string 'are face masks dangerous' in Italy, the UK and the USA using three search engines (Bing, Duckduckgo and Google). The majority (64-79%) were pages from news outlets, with few (2-6%) pages from government and public health agencies. Webpages with a positive stance on masks were more frequent in English (50%) than in Italian (36%), and those with a negative stance were more frequent in Italian (28% vs. 19% in English). Google returned the highest number of mask-positive pages and Duckduckgo the lowest. Google also returned the lowest number of pages mentioning conspiracy theories and Duckduckgo the highest. Webpages in Italian scored lower than those in English in transparency (reporting authors, their credentials and backing the information with references). When issues about the use of face masks were analyzed, mask effectiveness was the most discussed followed by hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide), contraindication in respiratory disease, and hypoxia, with issues related to their contraindications in mental health conditions and disability mentioned by very few pages. This study suggests that: 1) public health agencies should increase their web presence in providing correct information on face masks; 2) search engines should improve the information quality criteria in their ranking; 3) the public should be more informed on issues related to the use of masks and disabilities, mental health and stigma arising for those people who cannot wear masks.",Shaily Meta; Daria Ghezzi; Alessia Catalani; Tania Vanzolini; Pietro Ghezzi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218271,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218271,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
19,The COVID-19 Suffolk Events Toolkit (C-SET): A structured approach to conducting COVID-secure events,"Objectives: To develop a toolkit to provide a structured framework for assessing whether large events are COVID-secure. Study design: Cross-sectional reporting on the development of the COVID-19 Suffolk Events Toolkit (C-SET). Methods: The toolkit was developed through an iterative process of writing, discussion, and modification, drawing upon national UK guidance. Pilot cases and a contemporaneous consultation with experts were also undertaken, and C-SET was revised in line with the findings. Results: C-SET offers a robust, structured approach to identifying areas of concern and potential mitigations, and collates and synthesises current national UK guidance. A flexible, modular design allows it to provide high-level input across all types of event, and allow modification to suit the needs of individual organisations. It is applicable to a variety of users, including event organisers in need of a structure, or bodies whose role is to appraise such events. It provides a semi-quantitative summary output, and in conjunction with the detailed links to guidance in the framework, allows development of clear, actionable recommendations to tangibly improve the quality of events. Conclusions: A necessary trade-off exists between COVID-related health risks and wider risks due to economic downturn, and facilitating large events in a way that minimises COVID transmission risk may offer a way to balance these competing priorities. C-SET was developed to provide a structured approach to identifying areas of improvement across key risk domains, and suggests potential mitigations that are underpinned by national UK guidance. Use of this toolkit may aid event organisers in developing COVID-secure events, and aid regulatory bodies in suggesting actionable recommendations through generation of a summary report of areas of concern.",Avirup Chowdhury; Terezija Zermanos; Xinming Yu; Padmanabhan Badrinath,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218412,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218412,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
20,The French Covid-19 contact tracing app: usage and opinions by students in the health domain,"Background: Many countries around the world have developed mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing to control the Covid-19 pandemic. In France, a few people have downloaded and are using the StopCovid contact tracing app. Reasons for this low uptake are unexplored. Students in the health domain are especially concerned and their usage and opinions about the app can inform improvements and diffusion of StopCovid among young people. Objective: To investigate health-related students' usage and opinions about the StopCovid app. Methods: A field survey was conducted among 318 students at the health sciences campus of the University of Bordeaux, France. Quota sampling method was used and descriptive statistics were performed. Results: A total of 77.3% (246/318) students had heard about the app, but only 11.3% (36/318) had downloaded it and 4.7% (15/318) were still using it. Main reasons for not using the app were: belief that it was not effective given its limited diffusion (17.6%, 37/210), lack of interest (17.6%, 37/210) and distrust in data security and fear to be geo-located (15.7%, 33/210). Among those who had not heard about the app, after a brief description of its functioning and confidentiality policy, 52.7% (38/72) would use it. Participants reported that the main solution for increasing the use of the app would be a better communication strategy (71.4%, 227/318).

21,Detection and Segmentation of Lesion Areas in Chest CT Scans For The Prediction of COVID-19,"In this paper we compare the models for the detection and segmentation of Ground Glass Opacity and Consolidation in chest CT scans. These lesion areas are often associated both with common pneumonia and COVID-19. We train a Mask R-CNN model to segment these areas with high accuracy using three approaches: merging masks for these lesions into one, deleting the mask for Consolidation, and using both masks separately. The best model achieves the mean average precision of 44.68% using MS COCO criterion for instance segmentation across all accuracy thresholds. The classification model, COVID-CT-Mask-Net, which learns to predict the presence of COVID-19 vs common pneumonia vs control, achieves the 93.88% COVID-19 sensitivity, 95.64% overall accuracy, 95.06% common pneumonia sensitivity and 96.91% true negative rate on the COVIDx-CT test split (21192 CT scans) using a small fraction of the training data.

22,DNA methylation and gene expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes in saliva samples of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic affecting the health and economy of the world. Although it was known that this virus uses ACE2 protein along with TMPRSS2 to enter the host cell, the methylation pattern and gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes are not explored in saliva samples of patients infected with COVID-19. The study aimed to quantify promoter methylation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 along with its mRNA expression in saliva samples of COVID-19 patients in order to understand the regulatory mechanism of these genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Saliva samples were collected from thirty male patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and thirty age-matched healthy control male subjects. Q MS PCR and qRT PCR was performed to quantify the promoter DNA methylation and mRNA expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 respectively. Our study didnot find any significant difference between methylation and expression of these two genes in cases compared to control subjects. However there was significant positive correlation between DNA methylation of ACE2 and its gene expression. Among cases, the sample collected more than or equal to 7 days after appearance of symptoms showed higher amount of methylation in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes when compared to sample collected before 7 days. In conclusion, we found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 methylation plays a role in COVID-19.",Pratibha Misra; Bhasker Mukherjee; Rakhi Negi; Vikas Marwah; Arijit Kumar Ghosh; Prashant Jindamwar; Mukesh U Singh; Yaongamphi Vashum; Syamraj R; Bala Chandra G; Sibin M K,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20218727,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20218727,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
23,Large-scale population analysis of SARS-CoV2 whole genome sequences reveals host-mediated viral evolution with emergence of mutations in the viral Spike protein associated with elevated mortality rates,"Abstract Background We aimed to further characterize and analyze in depth intra-host variation and founder variants of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide up until August 2020, by examining in excess of 94,000 SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences in order to understand SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution, how these variants arose and identify any increased mortality associated with these variants. Methods and Findings We combined worldwide sequencing data from GISAID and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repositories and discovered SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation occurring in less than 2% of COVID19 patients, likely caused by host mechanisms involved APOBEC3G complexes and intra-host microdiversity. Most of this intra-host variation occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to change viral proteins with defined variant signatures, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be actively shaped by the host immune system to varying degrees. At the global population level, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Nsp2, 3C-like proteinase, ORF3a and ORF8 are under active evolution, as evidenced by their increased {pi}N/{pi}S ratios per geographical region. Importantly, two emergent variants: V1176F in co-occurrence with D614G mutation in the viral Spike protein, and S477N, located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, are associated with high fatality rates and are increasingly spreading throughout the world. The S477N variant arose quickly in Australia and experimental data support that this variant increases Spike protein fitness and its binding to ACE2. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 is evolving non-randomly, and human hosts shape emergent variants with positive fitness that can easily spread into the population. We propose that V1776F and S477N variants occurring in the Spike protein are two novel mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 and may pose significant public health concerns in the future.",Carlos Farkas; Andy Mella; Jody J Haigh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218511,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218511,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True

Serologic testing detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgM specifically may serve as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease. We evaluated the Abbott anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays along with DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total. Methods: Specimens from 175 PCR-positive patients and 107 control specimens were analyzed using Abbott IgM and IgG, DiaSorin IgG, and Roche Total (IgA, IgG, IgM) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, concordance between assays, trends over time, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. Results: Abbott IgM sensitivity was 63.6% at 0 days post-PCR positivity, 76.5% at 1-5d, 76.3% at 6-14d, 85.2% at 15-30d, and 63.6% at >30d. All assays exhibited highest sensitivity 15-30d post-PCR positivity (83.3-85.2%). Combining Abbott IgM and IgG improved sensitivity by 22.7% compared to IgG alone when tested 0d post-PCR positivity. All assays had a specificity of 100% and only Abbott IgG exhibited cross-reactivity (anti-dsDNA). Cohen's kappa varied between 0.86-0.93. Time to seroconversion from PCR positivity was lowest for Abbott IgM and highest for Abbott IgG. NPV was highest for Abbott IgM <14 days post-PCR positivity and Abbott IgG [&ge;]14 days. Conclusion: The Abbott IgM assay exhibited the earliest response and greatest signal in most patients evaluated for serial sampling and had the highest NPV <14 days post-PCR positivity, suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease course.",Victoria Higgins; Anselmo Fabros; Xiao Yan Wang; Maria Bhandari; David J Daghfal; Vathany Kulasingam,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20217810,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20217810,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True

Design: Multicenter observational retrospective cohort study. Setting: Greater Paris University hospitals, France. Participants: 7,345 adults hospitalized for COVID-19 between 24 January and 1 April 2020, including 138 patients (1.9%) who received hydroxyzine during the visit at a mean dose of 49.8 mg (SD=51.5) for an average of 22.4 days (SD=25.9). Data source: Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. Main outcome measures: The study endpoint was death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received hydroxyzine and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, and comorbidities), clinical and biological markers of disease severity, and use of other medications. The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting. Sensitivity analyses included a multivariable Cox model and a univariate Cox regression model in a 1:1 ratio matched analytic sample. Results: Over a mean follow-up of 20.3 days (SD=27.5), 994 patients (13.5%) had a primary end-point event. The primary multivariable analysis with inverse probability weighting showed a significant association between hydroxyzine use and reduced mortality (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.71; p=0.001) with a significant dose-effect relationship (HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.45; p=0.003). This association was similar in sensitivity analyses. In secondary analyses conducted among subsamples of patients, we found a significant association between hydroxyzine use and a faster decrease in biological inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19-related mortality, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCRP), and circulating interleukin 6 levels (IL-6) (all p<0.016), with a significant dose-effect relationship for NLR and LCRP (both p<0.037). Conclusions: In this retrospective observational study, hydroxyzine use was associated with reduced mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This association may be partially mediated by specific anti-inflammatory properties of H1 antihistamines. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of hydroxyzine for COVID-19 are needed to confirm these results.",Nicolas Hoertel; Marina Sánchez; Raphaël Vernet; Nathanaël Beeker; Antoine Neuraz; Carlos Blanco; Mark Olfson; Melanie M.

Acute polymerase-chain reaction is the gold standard test for this disease, is not available everywhere. Standard blood laboratory parameters may have diagnostic potential. Methods We evaluated standard blood laboratory parameters of 655 COVID-19 patients suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, who underwent PCR testing in one of five hospitals in Vienna, Austria. Additionally, clinical characteristics and 28-day outcome were obtained from medical records. We compared standard blood laboratory parameters, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between positive and negative PCR-tested patients and evaluated the ability of those parameters to distinguish between groups. Results Of the 590 study patients including 276 females and 314 males, aged between 20 and 100 years, 208 were tested positive by means of PCR. Patients with positive compared to negative PCR-tests had significantly lower levels of leukocytes, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and thrombocytes; while significantly higher levels were detected with hemoglobin, C-reactive-protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), activated-partial-thromboplastin-time (aPTT), creatine-kinase (CK), lactatedehydrogenase (LDH), alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), and lipase. Our multivariate model correctly classified 83.9% of cases with a sensitivity of 78.4%, specificity of 87.3%, positive predictive value of 79.5%, and negative predictive value of 86.6%. Decreasing leucocytes and eosinophils and increasing hemoglobin and CRP were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of being COVID-19 positive tested.

28,Airborne Pathogens in a Heterogeneous World: Superspreading & Mitigation,"Epidemics are regularly associated with reports of superspreading: single individuals infecting many others. How do we determine if such events are due to people inherently being biological superspreaders or simply due to random chance? We present an analytically solvable model for airborne diseases which reveal the spreading statistics of epidemics in socio-spatial heterogeneous spaces and provide a baseline to which data may be compared. In contrast to classical SIR models, we explicitly model social events where airborne pathogen transmission allows a single individual to infect many simultaneously, a key feature that generates distinctive output statistics. We find that diseases that have a short duration of high infectiousness can give extreme statistics such as 20 % infecting more than 80 %, depending on the socio-spatial heterogeneity. Quantifying this by a distribution over sizes of social gatherings, tracking data of social proximity for university students suggest that this can be a approximated by a power law. Finally, we study mitigation efforts applied to our model. We find that the effect of banning large gatherings works equally well for diseases with any duration of infectiousness, but depends strongly on socio-spatial heterogeneity.",Julius B Kirkegaard; Joachim Mathiesen; Kim Sneppen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20218784,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20218784,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
29,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies in the Staff of a Public School System in the Midwestern United States,"Background Since March 2020, the United States has lost over 200,000 lives to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. A growing body of literature describes population-level SARS-CoV-2 exposure, but studies of antibody seroprevalence within school systems are critically lacking, hampering evidence-based discussions on school reopenings. The Lake Central School Corporation (LCSC), a public school system in suburban Indiana, USA, assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in its staff and identified correlations between seropositivity and subjective histories and demographics. Methods This study is a cross-sectional, population-based analysis of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in LCSC staff measured in July 2020. We tested for seroprevalence with the Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. The primary outcome was the total seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and secondary outcomes included trends of antibody presence in relation to baseline attributes. Findings 753 participants representative of the staff at large were enrolled. 22 participants (2.9%, 95% CI: 1.8% - 4.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Correcting for test performance parameters, the seroprevalence is estimated at 1.7% (90% Credible Interval: 0.27% - 3.3%). Multivariable logistic regression including mask wearing, travel history, symptom history, and contact history revealed a 48-fold increase in the odds of seropositivity if an individual previously tested positive for COVID-19 (OR: 48.2, 95% CI: 4 - 600). Amongst individuals with no previous positive test, exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 increased the odds of seropositivity by 7-fold (OR: 6.5, 95% CI: 2.06 - 18.9). Interpretation Assuming the presence of antibodies is associated with immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, these results demonstrate a broad lack of herd immunity amongst the school corporation staff irrespective of employment role or location. Protective measures like contact tracing face coverings, and social distancing are therefore vital to maintaining the safety of both students and staff as the school year progresses.",Lilah Lopez; Graham Weber; Thao Nguyen; Katlyn Kleimola; Megan Bereda; Yiling Liu; Emma K.

30,Preliminary Estimates of Years of Life Lost (YLL) Due to COVID-19 in India,"More than 7 million cases of COVID have been detected in India by the middle of October 2020 and more than 100 thousand deaths have occurred. In this communication, we present an estimate the years of life lost (YLL) due to COVID-19 so far and the projection for the full year so that the health damage by this new disease can be compared with some other ailments. The YLL by one premature death is the expectation of life at that age. To calculate YLL, age-wise distribution of COVID cases and deaths was obtained from the official sources of the government of India. Similar calculations were done for the general population from all causes for comparison. A total of more than 2 million years of life have already lost due to COVID-19 and the pattern indicates that we may end up with nearly 4 million YLL due to this disease in India. This is nearly 20 years lost per COVID death, 303 years lost per 1000 cases of COVID, and about 3 years lost per 1000 population in the full year. The age-group 50-59 years has been particularly affected. Other important findings are summarized as key messages. The years of life lost so far and anticipated in full year are enormous but may still be lower compared with some other causes such as road injuries.",Abhaya Indrayan; Aman Mishra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20218693,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20218693,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
31,Establishment & lineage dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the UK,"The UK's COVID-19 epidemic during early 2020 was one of world's largest and unusually well represented by virus genomic sampling. Here we reveal the fine-scale genetic lineage structure of this epidemic through analysis of 50,887 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, including 26,181 from the UK sampled throughout the country's first wave of infection. Using large-scale phylogenetic analyses, combined with epidemiological and travel data, we quantify the size, spatio-temporal origins and persistence of genetically-distinct UK transmission lineages. Rapid fluctuations in virus importation rates resulted in >1000 lineages; those introduced prior to national lockdown were larger and more dispersed. Lineage importation and regional lineage diversity declined after lockdown, whilst lineage elimination was size-dependent. We discuss the implications of our genetic perspective on transmission dynamics for COVID-19 epidemiology and control.",Louis du Plessis; John T. McCrone; Alexander E.

32,COVID -19: could green tea catechins reduce the risks?,"Objectives: Several lines of emerging pharmacological and epidemiological evidence imply that overall risks related to COVID-19 may be reduced by green tea catechins. Therefore, it may be expected that: (i) higher green tea consumption is associated with lower COVID-19 morbidity and/or mortality; (ii) countries with higher per/capita green tea consumption would be less affected by COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the second possibility. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods: Among countries with at least 3 million population (n=134), countries with relatively high (above 150 g) per/capita green tea consumption have been tentatively identified (n=21); (ii) normalized to population values of COVID-19 cases (morbidity) and deaths (mortality) for groups of countries with high and low per/capita green tea consumption were compared. Results: Striking differences in COVID-19 morbidity (and mortality) between groups of countries with higher and lower green tea consumption. The differences were still observed after the adjustment for the onset of the disease. Besides, preliminary analysis using multiple linear regression approach suggests that the associations are present at the level of individual countries. Conclusion: Evidence supporting the idea that green tea constituents could reduce overall risks related to COVID-19 has been obtained. The results are promising and are in line with emerging evidence from other studies including pharmacological ones. Nevertheless, because of limitations of this study the idea still should be considered as a hypothesis requiring further assessment.",Maksim Storozhuk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218479,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218479,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
33,Reducing Covid-19 risk in schools: a qualitative examination of staff and family views and concerns,"Background The Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated schools implementing Covid-19 risk-reduction measures. Methods We investigated young people, parent and school staff attitudes towards secondary school Covid-19 mitigation measures. Recruitment used school communication, community organisations and snowball sampling. Audio recorded online/phone individual/group interviews lasted 45 minutes. Interviews focused on social distancing, hand-hygiene and testing. Team framework analysis used interview notes and transcripts. Results Participants were 13 school staff, 20 parents and 17 young people. Concerns about Covid-19 risk at school, especially to vulnerable individuals, were outweighed by perceived risks of not returning to school. Some teachers anticipated guilt around being a potential spreader. Participants saw school mitigation measures as an acceptable and pragmatic solution to the impossibility of social distancing, although anticipated challenges in changing habitual behaviour. Participants supported school Covid-19 testing but identified the need to consider data security and stigma. Staff were concerned about unintended consequences of risk-reduction strategies and widening inequalities. Conclusion Families and staff supported Covid-19 mitigation measures in schools. Clear messaging and engendering collective responsibility are important for compliance and success. However, schools and policy makers should consider unintended consequences of measures, supporting vulnerable individuals and those with additional needs, and avoiding widening inequalities.",Ava Lorenc; Joanna May Kesten; Judith Kidger; Rebecca Langford; Jeremy Horwood,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20216937,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20216937,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
34,"Factors driving availability of COVID-19 convalescent plasma: Insights from a demand, production and supply model","Background: COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) is a promising treatment for COVID-19. Blood collectors have rapidly scaled up collection and distribution programs. Methods: We developed a detailed simulation model of CCP donor recruitment, collection, production and distribution processes. Simulations based on epidemics in 11 U.S. states, in which key parameters were varied over wide ranges, allowed identification of the drivers of ability to calibrate collections capacity and ability to meet demand for CCP. Results: Changes in collection capacity utilization lagged increases and decreases in COVID-19 hospital discharges, and never exceeded 75% in most simulations. Demand could be met for most of the simulation period in most simulations, but in states with early sharp increases in hospitalizations a substantial portion of demand went unmet during these early peaks. Modeled second wave demand could generally be met with stockpiles established during first epidemic peaks. Apheresis machine capacity (number of machines) and probability that COVID-19 recovered individuals are willing to donate were the most important supply-side drivers of ability to meet demand. Recruitment capacity was important in states with early peaks. Conclusions: Epidemic trajectory was the most important determinant of ability to meet demand for CCP, although our simulations revealed several contributing operational drivers of CCP program success.",W.

35,MEGA: Machine Learning-Enhanced Graph Analytics for COVID-19 Infodemic Control,"Statistical network analysis plays a critical role in managing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infodemic such as addressing community detection and rumor source detection problems in social networks. As the data underlying infodemiology are fundamentally huge graphs and statistical in nature, there are computational challenges to the design of graph algorithms and algorithmic speedup. A framework that leverages cloud computing is key to designing scalable data analytics for infodemic control. This paper proposes the MEGA framework, which is a novel joint hierarchical clustering and parallel computing technique that can be used to process a variety of computational tasks in large graphs. Its unique feature lies in using statistical machine learning to exploit the inherent statistics of data to accelerate computation. Our MEGA framework consists of first pruning, followed by hierarchical clustering based on geodesic distance and then parallel computing, lending itself readily to parallel computing software, e.g., MapReduce or Hadoop. In particular, we illustrate how our MEGA framework computes two representative graph problems for infodemic control, namely network motif counting for community detection and network centrality computation for rumor source detection. Interesting special cases of optimal tuning in the MEGA framework are identified based on geodesic distance characterization and random graph model analysis. Finally, we evaluate its performance using cloud software implementation and real-world graph datasets to demonstrate its computational efficiency over existing state of the art.",Ching Nam Hang; Pei-Duo Yu; Lin Ling; Chee Wei Tan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20215061,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20215061,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
36,Rapid Development of a  De Novo  Convalescent Plasma Program in Response to a Global Pandemic: A Large Southeastern U.S. Blood Center's Experience,"Background: With no vaccine or treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 (CCP) patients offered a potential therapy. In March of 2020, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized CCP under emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) exemption and an IRB-approved Expanded Access Program (EAP) to treat severe COVID-19. Hospital demand grew rapidly in the Southeastern US, resulting in backlogs of CCP orders. We describe a large US blood center's (BC) rapid implementation of a CCP program in response to community needs. Study Design and Methods: From April 2 to May 17, 2020 CCP was collected by whole blood or apheresis. Initial manual approaches to donor intake, collection and distribution were rapidly replaced with automated processes. All CCP donors and products underwent FDA-required screening and testing. Results: 619 CCP donors (299 females, 320 males) presented for CCP donation [161 (25.6%) whole blood, 466 (74.1%) plasmapheresis] resulting in 1219 CCP units. Production of CCP increased as processes were automated and streamlined, from a mean of 11 donors collected/day for the first month to a mean of 25 donors collected/day in the subsequent two weeks. Backlogged orders were cleared, and inventory began to accumulate 4 weeks after project initiation. Conclusion: The BC was able to implement an effective de novo CCP collection program within 6 weeks in response to a community need in a global pandemic.

The mortality rate and admission rate to intensive care unit were compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The prediction model for patient mortality was developed through risk factor analysis among asymptomatic patients. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 25.8%. The mortality rates were not different between groups (3.3% vs. 4.5%, p=0.17). However, symptomatic patients were more likely to receive ICU care compared to asymptomatic patients (4.1% vs. 1.0%, p<0.0001). The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score (CCIS) was the most potent predictor for patient mortality in asymptomatic patients. The clinicians should predict the risk of death by evaluating age and comorbidities but not the presence of symptoms.",Hayne Cho Park; Do Hyoung Kim; AJin Cho; Juhee Kim; Kyu-sang Yun; Jinseog Kim; Young-Ki Lee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20218982,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20218982,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
38,"Clinical evaluation of a fully automated, lab developed multiplex RT-PCR assay integrating dual-target SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza-A/B detection on a high-throughput platform","Background: Laboratories worldwide face high demands for molecular testing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that might be further aggravated with the upcoming influenza season in the northern hemisphere. Considering that symptoms of influenza are largely undistinguishable from COVID-19, both SARS-CoV-2 and the Influenza viruses require concurrent testing by RT-PCR in patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory tract infection. In this study, we adapted and evaluated a laboratory developed multiplex RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 (dual-target), Influenza-A and Influenza-B (SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT) on a fully automated high-throughput system (cobas6800). Methods: Analytical performance was assessed by serial dilution of quantified reference material and cell culture stocks in transport medium, including pre-treatment for chemical inactivation. For clinical evaluation, residual portions of 164 predetermined patient samples containing SARS-CoV-2 (n=52), Influenza-A (n=43) or Influenza-B (n=19), as well as a set of negative samples was subjected to the novel multiplex assay. Results: The assay demonstrated analytical performance comparable to currently available commercial tests, with limits of detection of 94.9 cp/ml for SARS-CoV-2, 14.6 cp/ml for Influenza-A and 422.3 cp/ml for Influenza-B. Clinical evaluation showed excellent agreement with the comparator assays (sensitivity 98.1%, 97.7% and 100% for Sars-CoV-2, Influenza-A and -B respectively). Conclusion: The SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT allows for efficient high-throughput testing for all three pathogens and thus provides streamlined diagnostics while conserving resources during the Influenza-season.",Dominik Nörz; Armin Hoffmann; Martin Aepfelbacher; Susanne Pfefferle; Marc Lütgehetmann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20215285,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20215285,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
39,Serologic SARS-CoV-2 testing in healthcare workers with positive RT-PCR test or Covid-19 related symptoms,"Background. Limited information is available on prevalence and determinants of serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCWs). Methods. We analyzed the results of serologic testing with chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer (CLIA), lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test among 544 HCWs with at least one positive RT-PCR test and 157 HCWs with Covid-19 related symptoms without a positive RT-PCR test from public hospitals in Bologna, Northern Italy. Tests were performed between March and August 2020. We fitted multivariate logistic regression models to identify determinants of positive serology. Results. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 75.2% (LFIA) and 90.6% (CLIA). No differences in seropositivity were observed by sex, while older HCWs had higher positivity than other groups, and nurses had higher positivity compared to physicians, but not other HCWs. An estimated 73.4% of HCWs with Covid-19 symptoms without RT-PCR test were not infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions.

40,Viral load in community SARS-CoV-2 cases varies widely and temporally,"Background: Information on COVID-19 in representative community surveillance is limited, particularly regarding cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 viral load) and symptoms. Methods: We included all positive nose and throat swabs between 26 April-11 October 2020 from the UK national COVID-19 Infection Survey, tested by RT-PCR for the N, S and ORF1ab genes. We investigated predictors of median Ct value using quantile regression. Results: 1892(0.22%) of 843,851 results were positive, 1362(72%), 185(10%) and 345(18%) for 3, 2 or 1 genes respectively. Ct for different genes were strongly correlated (rho=0.99) with overall median Ct 26.2 (IQR 19.7-31.1; range 10.3-37.6), corresponding to ~2,500 dC/ml (IQR 80-240,000). Ct values were independently lower in those reporting symptoms, with more genes detected, and in first (vs. subsequent) positives per-participant, with no evidence of independent effects of sex, ethnicity, age, deprivation or other test characteristics (p>0.20). Whilst single-gene positives without reported symptoms almost invariably had Ct>30, triple-gene positives without reported symptoms had widely varying Ct. Incorporating pre-test probability and Ct values, 1547(82%) and 112(6%) positives had higher or lower supporting evidence for genuine infection. Ct values, symptomatic percentages and supporting evidence changed over time. With lower positivity in the summer, there were proportionally more lower evidence positives, and higher evidence positives had higher Ct values (p<0.0001), suggesting lower viral burden. Declines in mean/median Ct values were apparent throughout August and preceded increases in positivity rates. Conclusions: Community SARS-CoV-2 infections show marked variation in viral load.

41,Fluctuating High Throughput Serological Assay Results in Recurrent Convalescent Plasma Donors,"The clinical and scientific communities rely on serology testing to analyze the degree of antibody-mediated immunity afforded to recovered patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralizing antibodies present in COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) remains a practical therapy to treat COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. However, it remains unclear how long antibody levels persist in CCP donors after recovery. An accurate estimation of antibody kinetics in CCP donors provide an important observation to further define the extent of long-term immunity in recovered patient and simultaneously inform CCP collection processes in efforts to improve CCP dosing and therapeutic outcome. In this study, we analyzed 63 donors and measured antibody levels using two high throughput screening assays (HTSA) designed to detect antibodies targeting the spike protein (S1) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 and monitored antibody levels between 2-8 consecutive donations. We show that anti-S1 antibody levels, as measured using the Ortho Total Ig HTSA, increased over time in repeat CCP donors while anti-NP antibody levels, as measured using the Abbott IgG HTSA, were unchanged or decreased over time. When we normalized these data, we found that both the absolute levels of anti-S1 antibodies and the ratio between S1 and NP antibodies tends to increase over time.

43,Increasing SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing capacity by sample pooling,"Objectives: Limited testing capacity has characterized the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, hampering a timely control of outbreaks and the possibilities to reduce the escalation of community transmissions. Here we investigated the potential of using pooling of samples followed by one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity. Methods: We first evaluated different sample pooling (1:5, 1:10 and 1:15) prior to RNA extractions followed by standard RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. The pool size achieving reproducible results in independent tests was then used for assessing nasopharyngeal samples in a tertiary hospital during August 2020. Results: We found that pool size of five samples achieved the highest sensitivity compared to pool sizes of 10 and 15, showing a mean ({+/-} SD) Ct shift of 3.5 {+/-} 2.2 between the pooled test and positive samples in the pool. We then used a pool size of five to test a total of 895 pools (4,475 prospective samples) using two different RT-qPCR kits available at that time. The Real Accurate Quadruplex corona-plus PCR Kit (PathoFinder) reported the lowest mean Ct ({+/-} SD) shift (2.2 {+/-} 2.4) among the pool and the individual samples. The strategy allows detecting individual samples in the positive pools with Cts in the range of 16.7-39.4. Conclusions: We found that pools of five samples combined with RT-qPCR solutions helped to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity with minimal loss of sensitivity compared to that resulting from testing the samples independently.",Julia Alcoba-Florez; Helena Gil-Campesino; Diego Garcia-Martinez de Artola; Oscar Diez-Gil; Agustin Valenzuela-Fernandez; Rafaela Gonzalez-Montelongo; Laura Ciuffreda; Carlos Flores,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20218685,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.24.20218685,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True

Methods: We identified relevant studies by searching the PubMed, Embase, and medRxiv databases from December 2019 to October 1, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effects models. Only reports with multivariate adjusted results were included to avoid the impact of potential confounding factors. Results: A total of six studies with 377,265 patients were identified. Overall, in the categorical analysis, a low serum vitamin D level was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09- 1.97, I2=81%), hospitalization (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.22-2.74, I2=0%), but not in-hospital death (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 0.27-27.61). Notably, when vitamin D level was analyzed as a continuous variable, each 5 ng/ml increase in vitamin D level was not associated with any increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.96-1.12, I2=74%) or in-hospital death (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.93-1.12). Conclusions: Low serum vitamin D is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. In-hospital death showed a tendency to be increased in COVID-19 patients with low vitamin D levels.

45,Estimating the Case Fatality Ratio for COVID-19 using a Time-Shifted Distribution Analysis,"Estimating the case fatality ratio (CFR) for COVID-19 is an important aspect of public health. However, calculating CFR accurately is problematic early in a novel disease outbreak, due to uncertainties regarding the time course of disease and difficulties in diagnosis and reporting of cases. In this work, we present a simple method for calculating the case fatality ratio using only public case and death data over time by exploiting the correspondence between the time distributions of cases and deaths. The time-shifted distribution (TSD) analysis generates two parameters of interest: the delay time between reporting of cases and deaths and the case fatality ratio. These parameters converge reliably over time once the exponential growth phase has finished. Analysis is performed for early COVID 19 outbreaks in many countries, and we discuss corrections to CFR values using excess-death and seroprevalence data to estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR). While CFR values range from 0.2-20% in different countries, estimates for IFR are mostly around 0.5-0.8% for countries that experienced moderate outbreaks and 1-3% for severe outbreaks.

Adjustments to the crude CFR measure can better explain the pandemic situation by improving the CFR estimation. However, no study has thoroughly investigated COVID-19 adjusted CFR of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. In this study, we estimated both survival interval and underreporting adjusted CFR of COVID-19 for the SAARC countries and observed the CFR changes due to the imposition of fees on COVID-19 tests in Bangladesh. Using the daily records up to 9th October, we implemented a statistical method to remove both the bias in crude CFR, i.e., the delay between disease onset and outcome bias and due to asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases, reporting rates lower than 50% (95% CI: 10%-50%) bias. According to our findings, Afghanistan had the highest CFR, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. Our estimated crude CFR varied from 3.71% to 0.29%, survival interval adjusted CFR varied from 3.77% to 0.3% and further underreporting adjusted CFR varied from 1.1% to 0.08%. We have also found that crude CFR increased from 1.261% to 1.572% after imposing the COVID-19 test fees in Bangladesh. Therefore, the authorities of countries with higher CFR should be looking for strategic counsel from the countries with lower CFR to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to combat the pandemic. Moreover, caution is needed to report the CFR.",Md.

48,"Causes of death in mental health service users during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: South London and Maudsley data from March to June 2020, compared with 2015-2019.","The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a particularly high impact on the health and wellbeing of people with pre-existing mental disorders. This may include higher than expected mortality rates due to severe infections themselves, due to other comorbidities, or through increased suicide rates during lockdown. However, there has been very little published information to date on causes of death in mental health service users. Taking advantage of a large mental healthcare database linked to death registrations, we describe numbers of deaths within specific underlying-cause-of-death groups for the period from 1st March to 30th June in 2020 and compare these with the same four-month periods in 2015-2019. In past and current service users, there were 2561 deaths in March-June 2020, compared to an average of 1452 for the same months in 2015-19: an excess of 1109. The 708 deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause in 2020 accounted for 63.8% of that excess. The remaining excess was accounted for by unnatural/unexplained deaths and by deaths recorded as due to neurodegenerative conditions, with no excess in those attributed to cancer, circulatory disorders, digestive disorders, respiratory disorders, or other disease codes. Of 295 unexplained deaths in 2020 with missing data on cause, 162 (54.9%) were awaiting a formal death notice (i.e. the group that included deaths awaiting a coroner inquest), an excess of 129 compared to the average of previous years, accounting for 11.6% of the excess in total deaths.",Robert Stewart; Amelia Jewell; Matthew Broadbent; Ioannis Bakolis; Jayati Das-Munshi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20219071,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20219071,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True

50,Determinants of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures: a nationwide on-line survey in Greece and Cyprus,"Abstract A limited number of studies have investigated the distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures in the general population. We studied psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures in the general population in Greece and Cyprus. Also, we investigated several demographic, clinical and job characteristics of the participants as possible determinants of distress. Data collection was performed during lockdown measures in Greece and Cyprus (from April 21st to May 4th 2020). All participants provided informed consent to participate in the study. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) to measure the psychological distress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. Seventeen point four percent of the participants had overall IES-R score from 24 to 32 indicating that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical concern, while 33.5% had overall IES-R score >32 indicating that PTSD is a probable diagnosis. Females, Cyprus residents, participants that live with elderly people or patients with a chronic disease in home, participants with a mental health disease or/and chronic disease, participants under pharmaceutical treatment, participants that lost their work due to the pandemic and participants that work in hospital experienced greater distress. Also, increased age and decreased educational level was associated with increased distress. Findings suggest that our sample experienced great distress and this distress was affected by several demographic, clinical and job characteristics. Appropriate interventions should be established in order to support psychologically high risk groups and decrease their distress.

51,Tracking changes in reporting of epidemiological data during the COVID-19 pandemic in Southeast Asia: an observational study during the first wave,"Background When a new pathogen emerges, consistent case reporting is critical for public health surveillance. Tracking cases geographically and over time is key for understanding the spread of an infectious disease and how to effectively design interventions to contain and mitigate an epidemic. In this paper we describe the reporting systems on COVID-19 in Southeast Asia during the first wave in 2020, and highlight the impact of specific reporting methods. Methods We reviewed key epidemiological variables from various sources including a regionally comprehensive dataset, national trackers, dashboards, and case bulletins for 11 countries during the first wave of the epidemic in Southeast Asia. We recorded timelines of shifts in epidemiological reporting systems. We further described the differences in how epidemiological data are reported across countries and timepoints, and the accessibility of epidemiological data. Findings Our findings suggest that countries in Southeast Asia generally reported precise and detailed epidemiological data during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, changes in reporting were frequent and varied across data and countries. Changes in reporting rarely occurred for demographic data such as age and sex, while reporting shifts for geographic and temporal data were frequent. We also found that most countries provided COVID-19 individual-level data daily using HTML and PDF, necessitating scraping and extraction before data could be used in analyses. Interpretation Countries have different reporting systems and different capacities for maintaining consistent reporting of epidemiological data. As the pandemic progresses, governments may also change their priorities in data sharing. Our study thus highlights the importance of more nuanced analyses of epidemiological data of COVID-19 within and across countries because of the frequent shifts in reporting. Further, most countries provide data on a daily basis but not always in a readily usable format. As governments continue to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on health and the economy, data sharing also needs to be prioritised given its foundational role in policymaking, and the implementation and evaluation of interventions.

52,COVIDTrach; a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy in the UK,"Background: COVIDTrach is a UK multi-centre prospective cohort study project evaluating the outcomes of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation. It also examines the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers involved in the procedure. Method: An invitation to participate was sent to all UK NHS departments involved in tracheostomy in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Data was entered prospectively and clinical outcomes updated over time via an online database (REDCap). Clinical variables were compared with clinical outcomes using multivariable regression analysis, with logistic regression used to develop a prediction model for mortality. Participants recorded whether any of the operators tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the procedure. Findings: The cohort comprised 1605 tracheostomy cases from 126 UK hospitals. The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 15 days (IQR 11, 21). 285 (18%) patients died following the procedure. 1229 (93%) of the survivors had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation at censoring and 1049 (81%) had been discharged from hospital. Age, inspired oxygen concentration requirement on the day of tracheostomy, PEEP setting, pyrexia, number of days of ventilation before tracheostomy, C-reactive protein and the use of anticoagulation and inotropic support independently predicticted mortality. Six reports were received of operators testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks following the procedure. Interpretation: Tracheostomy appears to be safe in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and to operators performing the procedure and we identified clinical indicators that are predictive of mortality. Optimal timing of the procedure remains to be determined.

53,Economic Losses Associated with COVID-19 Deaths in the United States,"In addition to the overwhelming health effects of COVID-19, the disease has inflicted unprecedented economic damage. Vast resources have been directed at COVID-19 testing and health care while economic activity has been substantially curtailed due to disruptions resulting from individual choices and government policies. This study estimates the economic loss associated with COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. from February 1, 2020 through July 11, 2020. We use estimates of years of life lost that are based on the age and gender of decedents. Using a value of life year estimate of $66,759, we calculate economic losses of roughly $66 billion. The losses are concentrated in New York and New Jersey, which account for 17.5% of the total losses. Our analysis of per capita losses by state indicates that the highest values are located in the northeastern region of the country, while the values in the western states are relatively low.

54,Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Therapy compared to Fresh Frozen Plasma in Severely ill COVID-19 Patients: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: The role of convalescent plasma (COPLA) for the treatment of severely ill Corona Virus Disease-2019 is under investigation. We compared the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in severe COVID-19 patients. Methods and findings: This was an open-label, single-centre phase II RCT on 29 patients with severe COVID-19 from India. One group received COPLA with standard medical care (SMC) (n=14), and another group received FFP with SMC (n=15). A total of 29 patients were randomized in the two treatment groups. Eleven out of 14 (78.5%) patients remained free of ventilation at day seven in the intervention arm while the proportion was 14 out of 15 (93.3 %) in the control arm (p= 0.258). The median reductions in RR per min at 48-hours in COPLA-group and FFP group were -6.5 and -3 respectively [p=0.004] and at day seven were -14.5 and -10 respectively (p=0.008). The median improvements in percentage O2 saturation at 48-hours were 6.5 and 2 respectively [p=0.001] and at day seven were 10 and 7.5 respectively (p=0.026). In the COPLA-group, the median improvement in PaO2/FiO2 was significantly superior to FFP at 48-hours [41.94 and 231.15, p=0.009], and also at day-7 [5.55 and 77.01 p<0.001]. We did not find significant differences in hospitalization duration between the groups (0.08). Conclusion: COPLA therapy resulted in rapid improvement in respiratory parameters and shortened time to clinical recovery, although no significant reduction in mortality was observed in this pilot trial.

55,"Controlled randomized clinical trial on using Ivermectin with Doxycycline for treating COVID-19 patients in Baghdad, Iraq","Objectives: COVID-19 patients suffer from the lack of curative therapy. Hence, there is an urgent need to try repurposed old drugs on COVID-19. Methods: Randomized controlled study on 70 COVID-19 patients (48 mild-moderate, 11 severe, and 11 critical patients) treated with 200ug/kg PO of Ivermectin per day for 2-3 days along with 100mg PO doxycycline twice per day for 5-10 days plus standard therapy; the second arm is 70 COVID-19 patients (48 mild-moderate and 22 severe and zero critical patients) on standard therapy. The time to recovery, the progression of the disease, and the mortality rate were the outcome-assessing parameters. Results: among all patients and among severe patients, 3/70 (4.28%) and 1/11 (9%), respectively progressed to a more advanced stage of the disease in the Ivermectin-Doxycycline group versus 7/70 (10%) and 7/22 (31.81%), respectively in the control group (P>0.05). The mortality rate was 0/48 (0%), 0/11 (0%), and 2/11 (18.2%) in mild-moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients, respectively in Ivermectin-Doxycycline group versus 0/48 (0%), and 6/22 (27.27%) in mild-moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, respectively in standard therapy group (p=0.052). Moreover, the mean time to recovery was 6.34, 20.27, and 24.13 days in mild-moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients, respectively in Ivermectin-Doxycycline group versus 13.66 and 24.25 days in mild-moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, respectively in standard therapy group (P<0.01). Conclusions: Ivermectin with doxycycline reduced the time to recovery and the percentage of patients who progress to more advanced stage of disease; in addition, Ivermectin with doxycycline reduced mortality rate in severe patients from 22.72% to 0%; however, 18.2% of critically ill patients died with Ivermectin and doxycycline therapy.

56,Features of C-reactive protein in COVID-19 patients within various period: a cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a threat to the global. Due to the lack of efficient treatments, indicators were urgently needed during the evolvement of disease to analyze the illness and prognosis and prevent the aggravation of COVID-19. METHODS: All laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 People's Hospital were included. Patients' general information, clinical type, CRP value and outcome were collected. CRP values of all patients during disease course from different initial time were analyzed. RESULTS: The 131 enrolled patients were 50.13 plus-or-minus 17.13 years old. All cases underwent 724 tests of CRP since symptom onset, 53.18% of the test results were abnormal and the median value was 9.52 (2.63-34.10) mg/L. The first median value on the day 8 from exposure onset was 39.08 (11.92-47.89) mg/L then fluctuated around it until the day 28. The CRP median increased from 15.93 mg/L to 41.44 mg/L and then decreased to 18.26 mg/L before transformation of severe type, and then increased to 62.25 mg/L on the transforming date. Conversely, the CRP median increased from 56.17 mg/L 102.75 mg/L before transformation of critical type but decreased to 68.68 mg/L on the transforming date. The changes of CRP median over time before death ranged from 77.77 mg/L to 133.52 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: CRP increased before symptom onset and substantially increased during the early-to-mid stage (especially early stage), which was different from other virus-infected diseases. The changes of CRP before the transformation of clinical type was inconsistent with the aggravating of illness.

57,Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England during April to September 2020: Results from the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey,"Background: Decisions regarding the continued need for control measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive. Existing surveillance systems are not based on population samples and are generally not longitudinal in design. Methods: From 26 April to 19 September2020, 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals were collected from individuals aged 2 years and over from a representative sample of private households from England. Participants completed a questionnaire and nose and throat swab were taken. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time using dynamic multilevel regression and post-stratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also evaluated using multilevel regression models. Findings: Between 26 April and 19 September 2020, in total, results were available from 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals, of which 489 were positive overall from 398 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between end of April and June, followed by low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive in the first period but not (yet) in the second period of increased positivity rates, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms (53%-70%, dependent on calendar time).

58,High seroprevalence but short-lived immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Paris,"Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic peaked in March/April 2020 in France, the prevalence of infection is barely known. Herein, we assessed the serological response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a large population working in one institution of the Paris conurbation. We set up two high-throughput and sensitive methods to assess SARS CoV-2 Nucleoprotein and Spike protein-specific IgG response along with a pseudo-neutralization assay in sera. We studied 1847 participants who also answered a web-based survey on clinical symptoms. Methods and Results In May-July 2020, 11% (95% CI: 9.7-12.6) of serums were positive for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 N and S protein and 9.5% (CI:8.2-11.0) were pseudo-neutralizer. The prevalence of immunization was 11.6% (CI:10.2-13.2) considering positivity in at least one assays. In 5% (CI:3.9-7.1) of RT-qPCR positive individuals, no systemic IgGs were detected. Among immune individuals, 21% had been asymptomatic. Anosmia and ageusia occurred in 52% of the IgG-positive individuals and in 3% of the negative ones. In contrast, 30% of the anosmia-ageusia cases were seronegative suggesting that the true prevalence of infection may reach 16.6%. In sera obtained 4-8 weeks after the first sampling anti-N and anti-S IgG titers and pseudo-neutralization activity declined by 31%, 17% and 53%, respectively with half-life of 35, 87 and 28 days, respectively. Conclusions The population studied being not particularly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection is representative of active workers in the Paris conurbation, suggesting that the current epidemiological models may underestimate the true prevalence of infection.

59,Saliva is a promising alternative specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults,"Testing efforts for SARS-CoV-2 have been burdened by the scarcity of testing materials and personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. The simple and painless process of saliva collection allows for widespread testing, but enthusiasm is hampered by variable performance compared to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. We prospectively collected paired NPS and saliva samples from a total of 300 unique adult and pediatric patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 32.2% (97/300) of the individuals using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher). Performance of saliva and NPS were compared against the total number of positives regardless of specimen type. The overall concordance for saliva and NPS was 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively. The positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS was 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively. Saliva detected 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS. In symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA: 82.4% vs 85.3%). The overall PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively, with saliva detecting 4 cases less than NPS. However, saliva performance in symptomatic adults was identical to NPS (PPA of 93.8%).

60,"Impact of COVID-19 on the diagnoses, HbA1c monitoring and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes: a UK-wide cohort study involving 13 million people in primary care","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has already disproportionately impacted people with diabetes. Timely diagnosis and appropriate monitoring in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are necessary to reduce the risk of long-term complications. Methods: We constructed a cohort of 23M patients using electronic health records from 1709 UK general practices registered with the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), including 13M patients followed between March and July 2020. We compared trends in diagnoses, monitoring and mortality in T2D, before and after the first COVID-19 peak, using regression models and 10-year historical data. We extrapolated the number of missed or delayed diagnoses using UK Office for National Statistics data. Findings: In England, rates of new T2D diagnoses were reduced by 70% (95% CI 68%-71%) in April 2020, with similar reductions in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Between March and July, we estimated that there were more than 45,000 missed or delayed T2D diagnoses across the UK. In April, rates of HbA1c testing in T2D were greatly reduced in England (reduction: 77% (95% CI 76%-78%)) with more marked reductions in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales (reduction: 84% (83-84%)). Reduced rates of diagnosing and HbA1c monitoring were particularly evident in older people, in males, and in those from deprived areas. Mortality rates in T2D in England were more than 2-fold higher (110%) in April compared to prior trends, but were only 66% higher in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Interpretation: As engagement with the NHS increases, healthcare services will need to manage the backlog and the expected increase in T2D severity due to delayed diagnoses and reduced monitoring. Older people, men, and those from deprived backgrounds with T2D may be groups to target for early intervention.

61,Detecting COVID-19 infection hotspots in England using large-scale self-reported data from a mobile application,"Background As many countries seek to slow the spread of COVID-19 without reimposing national restrictions, it has become important to track the disease at a local level to identify areas in need of targeted intervention. Methods We performed modelling on longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between 24 March and 29 September, 2020. Combining a symptom-based predictive model for COVID-19 positivity and RT-PCR tests provided by the Department of Health we were able to estimate disease incidence, prevalence and effective reproduction number. Geographically granular estimates were used to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots. Findings More than 2.6 million app users in England provided 115 million daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 170,000 PCR tests. On a national level our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed similar sensitivity to changes as two national community surveys: the ONS and REACT studies. On a geographically granular level, our estimates were able to highlight regions before they were subject to local government lockdowns. Between 12 May and 29 September we were able to flag between 35-80% of regions appearing in the Government's hotspot list. Interpretation Self-reported data from mobile applications can provide a cost-effective and agile resource to inform a fast-moving pandemic, serving as an independent and complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance.",Thomas Varsavsky; Mark S Graham; Liane S Canas; Sajaysurya Ganesh; Joan Capdevila Puyol; Carole H Sudre; Benjamin Murray; Marc Modat; M.

62,Long-term monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater of the Frankfurt metropolitan area in Southern Germany,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a great approach that enables us to comprehensively monitor the community to determine the scale and dynamics of infections in a city, particularly in metropolitan cities with a high population density. Therefore, we monitored the time course of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in raw sewage in the Frankfurt metropolitan area, the European financial center. To determine the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in sewage, we continuously collected samples from two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents (Niederrad and Sindlingen) serving the Frankfurt metropolitan area and performed RT-qPCR analysis targeting three genes (N gene, S gene, and ORF1ab gene). In August, a resurgence in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was observed, reaching 3 x 10^13 copies/day, which represents similar levels compared to April with approx. 2 x 10^14 copies/day. This corresponds to an also continuous increase again in COVID-19 cases in Frankfurt since August, with an average of 28.6 incidences, compared to 28.7 incidences in April. Different temporal dynamics were observed between different sampling points, indicating local dynamics in COVID-19 cases within the Frankfurt metropolitan area. The SARS-CoV-2 load to the WWTP Niederrad ranged from approx. 4 x 10^11 to 1 x 10^15 copies/day, the load to the WWTP Sindlingen from approx. 1 x 10^11 to 2 x 10^14 copies/day, which resulted in a preceding increase in these loading in July ahead of the weekly averaged incidences. The study shows that WBE has the potential as early warning system for SARS-CoV-2 infections and as monitoring system to identify global hotspots of COVID 19.",Shelesh Agrawal; Laura Orschler; Susanne Lackner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20215020,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20215020,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
63,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on remote mental healthcare and prescribing in psychiatry,"Objectives: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted mental healthcare delivery, with many services shifting from in-person to remote patient contact. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the use of remote consultation and on the prescribing of psychiatric medications. Design and setting: The Clinical Record Interactive Search tool (CRIS) was used to examine de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of people receiving mental healthcare from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Data from the period before and after the onset of the pandemic were analysed using linear regression, and visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS). Participants: All patients receiving care from SLaM between 7th January 2019 and 20th September 2020 (around 37,500 patients per week). Outcome measures: i) The number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals per week ii) Prescribing of antipsychotic and mood stabiliser medications per week Results: Following the onset of the pandemic, the frequency of in-person contacts was significantly reduced compared to that in the previous year ({beta} coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p<0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts significantly increased ({beta} coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p<0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite this change in the type of patient contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in psychiatric prescribing. Nevertheless, further work is needed to ensure that older patients are able to access mental healthcare remotely.",Rashmi Patel; Jessica Irving; Aimee Brinn; Matthew Broadbent; Hitesh Shetty; Megan Pritchard; Johnny Downs; Robert Stewart; Robert Harland; Philip McGuire,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219576,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219576,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
64,Who is (Not) Complying with the Social Distancing Directive and Why? Testing a General Framework of Compliance with Multiple Measures of Social Distancing,"A study involving over 2000 online participants tested a general framework regarding compliance with a directive in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study featured not only a self-report measure of social distancing but also behavioral measures -- simulations that presented participants with graphical depictions mirroring multiple real-world scenarios and asked them to position themselves in relation to others in the scene. The conceptual framework highlights three essential components of a directive: (1) the source, some entity is advocating for a behavioral change; (2) the surrounding context, the directive is in response to some challenge; and (3) the target, the persons to whom the directive is addressed. Belief systems relevant to each of these three components are predicted, and were found, to relate to compliance with the social distancing directive.

65,Inconsistent with the intent of public health strategies on incidence and fatality in states with extra mandatory stay-at-home and face masks orders during COVID-19 pandemic in the US,"Backgrounds: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now recognized as a multi-system disease. The CDC recommends multiple preventive methods, including social distancing, hand hygiene, and wearing masks. In addition, some states imposed mandatory stay-at-home (SAH) and mandatory face mask (MFM) orders, to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between SAH and MFM approaches with the incidence and fatality. The research design is a cross-sectional study examining changes in incidence and fatality between states with and without SAH and MFM using available database from CDC during the pandemic periods of the date of the first positive case of each state to the date of 2020-08-23. Results: The daily new cases curve of the nation was flattened under the order of SAH and increased following the end of SAH and several nation-wide social gathering events. There were similar incidence rates among SAH + MFM states (95% CI, 1.19% to 1.64%. n=34), SAH + no-MFM states (95% CI, 1.26% to 2.36%. n=9) and no-SAH + no-MFM (95% CI, 1.08% to 1.63%. n=7). However, SAH+MFM states (n=34), SAH+no-MFM states (n=9) had significantly higher averages in daily new cases and daily fatality, case-fatality-ratio (CFR) and mortality rate (per 100,000 residents) than no-SAH+no-MFM states during pandemic periods (about 171 days), respectively. When normalized to population density, beside higher CFR in no-SAH+no-MFM, there were no significant differences in total positive cases, average daily new cases and average daily fatality among the 3 groups during the pandemic periods. When comparing incidence during the period of SAH (about 45 days. n=43 states), there were significantly higher incidence rates and average daily new cases in MFM states (n=12) than in no-MFM states (n=31). When normalized to population density, there were no significant differences in total positive cases and average daily new cases between the 2 groups during the period of SAH. Conclusion: This study provided direct evidence of a potential decreased in testing positivity rates, and a decreased fatality to save life when normalized by population density through strategies of SAH + MFM order during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, overall, our results were inconsistent with the intent of public health strategies of SAH and MFM in lowering transmission and fatality. From the policy making level, even if we can not strictly isolate contagious source patients in separate isolated places and without effective massive contact tracing, we presume that following the CDC recommendations with sufficient testing, could be appropriate to help in mitigate the COVID-19 disaster with close monitoring of healthcare capacity.",Xin Wu; Samuel Xi Wu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20219279,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20219279,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
66,Outcomes evaluated in controlled clinical trials on the management of COVID-19: A methodological systematic review,"It is crucial that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evaluate the outcomes that are critical to patients and clinicians, to facilitate relevance, interpretability, and comparability. This methodological systematic review describes the outcomes evaluated in 415 RCTs on the management of COVID-19, that were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, by 5/5/2020. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the selection of outcomes and the instruments used to measure them. Mortality, adverse events and treatment success or failure are only evaluated in 64.4%, 48.4% and 43% of the included studies, respectively, while other outcomes are selected less often. Studies focusing on more severe presentations (hospitalized patients or requiring intensive care) most frequently evaluate mortality and adverse events, while hospital admission and viral detection/load are most frequently assessed in the community setting. Outcome measurement instruments are poorly reported and heterogeneous. In general, simple instruments that can control for important sources of bias are favoured. Follow-up does not exceed one month in 64.3% of these earlier trials, and long-term COVID-19 burden is rarely assessed. The methodological issues identified could delay the introduction of potentially life-saving treatments in clinical practice.

67,What does the COVID-19 pandemic mean for the next decade of onchocerciasis control and elimination?,"Background: Mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin for onchocerciasis has been disrupted by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. Mathematical modelling can help predict how missed/delayed MDA will affect short-term epidemiological trends and elimination prospects by 2030. Methods: Two onchocerciasis transmission models (EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM) are used to simulate microfilarial prevalence trends, elimination probabilities, and age-profiles of Onchocerca volvulus microfilarial prevalence and intensity, for different treatment histories and transmission settings, assuming no interruption, a 1-year (2020) or 2-year (2020-2021) interruption. Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies. Results: Programmes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19's impact on MDA. Programmes which had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-year interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) or adults (ONCHOSIM). Conclusions: Programmes with shorter (annual MDA) treatment histories should be prioritised for remedial biannual MDA. Increases in microfilarial load could have short- and long-term morbidity and mortality repercussions. These results can guide decision-making to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on onchocerciasis elimination.",Jonathan I. D. Hamley; David J. Blok; Martin Walker; Philip Milton; Adrian D.

68,Effects of New York's Executive Order on Face Mask Use on COVID-19 Infections and Mortality: A Modeling Study,"Background: New York City (NYC) was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. On April 17, 2020, the State of New York implemented an Executive Order that requires all people in New York to wear a face mask or covering in public settings where social distancing cannot be maintained. It is unclear how this Executive Order has affected the spread of COVID-19 in NYC. Methods: A dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission among NYC residents was developed to assess the effect of the Executive Order on face mask use on infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in NYC. Data on daily and cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths were obtained from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Results: The Executive Order on face mask use is estimated to avert 99,517 (95% CIs: 72,723-126,312) COVID-19 infections and 7,978 (5,692-10,265) deaths in NYC. If the Executive Order was implemented one week earlier (on April 10), the averted infections and deaths would be 111,475 (81,593-141,356) and 9,017 (6,446-11,589), respectively. If the Executive Order was implemented two weeks earlier (on April 3 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face mask use), the averted infections and deaths would be 128,598 (94,373-162,824) and 10,515 (7,540-13,489), respectively. Conclusions: New York's Executive Order on face mask use is projected to have significantly reduced the spread of COVID-19 in NYC.

69,Cathepsin L plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and humanized mice and is a promising target for new drug development,"To discover new drugs to combat COVID-19, an understanding of the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is urgently needed. Here, for the first time, we report the crucial role of cathepsin L (CTSL) in patients with COVID-19. The circulating level of CTSL was elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and was positively correlated with disease course and severity. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection increased CTSL expression in human cells in vitro and human ACE2 transgenic mice in vivo, while CTSL overexpression, in turn, enhanced pseudovirus infection in human cells. CTSL functionally cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and enhanced virus entry, as evidenced by CTSL overexpression and knockdown in vitro and application of CTSL inhibitor drugs in vivo. Furthermore, amantadine, a licensed anti-influenza drug, significantly inhibited CTSL activity after SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and prevented infection both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, CTSL is a promising target for new anti-COVID-19 drug development.",Jin-Kui Yang; Miao-Miao Zhao; Wei-Li Yang; Fang-Yuan Yang; Li Zhang; Weijin Huang; Changfa Fan; Wei Hou; Ronghua Jin; Yingmei Feng; Youchun Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20218990,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20218990,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
70,Modelling the impact of COVID-19-related programme interruptions on visceral leishmaniasis in India,"Background: In March 2020, India declared a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of COVID-19. As a result, control efforts against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were interrupted. Methods: Using an established age-structured deterministic VL transmission model, we predicted the impact of a 6 to 24-month programme interruption on the timeline towards achieving the VL elimination target, as well as on the increase of VL cases. We also explored the potential impact of a mitigation strategy after the interruption. Results: Delays towards the elimination target are estimated to range between 0 to 9 years. Highly endemic settings where control efforts have been ongoing for 5-8 years are most affected by an interruption, for which we identified a mitigation strategy to be most relevant. However, more importantly, all settings can expect an increase in the number of VL cases. This increase is substantial even for settings with a limited expected delay in achieving the elimination target. Conclusion: Besides implementing mitigation strategies, it is of great importance to try and keep the duration of the interruption as short as possible, to prevent new individuals from becoming infected with VL, and continue the efforts towards VL elimination as a public health problem in India.",Epke Annelie Le Rutte; Luc E.

Methods We conducted a case cohort study of autoimmune disease patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR) from 02/01/2020 to 07/31/2020 and compared them in a 1:3 ratio with uninfected patients who were matched based on race, age, sex, and comorbidity index. Patient demographics, clinical course, and outcomes were compared among these patient groups. Results A total of 70 rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 56.6 years; 64% African American) were identified. The 34 (49%) patients who were hospitalized used oral glucocorticoids more frequently (p<0.01). All 10 patients on anti-TNF medications were treated as outpatients (p<0.01). Those hospitalized with COVID-19 more often required ICU admission (17 (50%) vs 27 (26%), OR=2.78 (95% CI: 1.24 to 6.20)) and intubation (10 (29%) vs 6 (6%), OR=6.67 (95% CI: 2.20 to 20.16)) than uninfected patients. They also had higher mortality rates (6 (18%) vs 3 (3%), OR=7.21 (95% CI: 1.70 to 30.69)). Of the six COVID-19 patients who died, one was of African ancestry (p=0.03). Conclusions Rheumatic disease patients infected with COVID-19 were more likely to require ICU admission, ventilation, and died more frequently versus uninfected patients with autoimmune disease. Patients on anti-TNF medications were hospitalized less frequently while those on chronic glucocorticoids were hospitalized more frequently.

72,Human movement can inform the spatial scale of interventions against COVID-19 transmission,"The UK enacted an intensive, nationwide lockdown on March 23 2020 to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. As restrictions began to ease, resurgence in transmission has been targeted by geographically-limited interventions of various stringencies. Determining the optimal spatial scale for local interventions is critical to ensure interventions reach the most at risk areas without unnecessarily restricting areas at low risk of resurgence. Here we use detailed human mobility data from Facebook to determine the spatially-explicit network community structure of the UK before and during the lockdown period, and how that has changed in response to the easing of restrictions and to locally-targeted interventions. We found that the mobility network became more sparse and the number of mobility communities decreased under the national lockdown. During this period, there was no evidence of re-routing in the network. Communities in which locally-targeted interventions have happened following resurgence did not show reorganization but did show small decreases in measurable mobility effects in the Facebook dataset. We propose that geographic communities detected in Facebook or other mobility data be part of decision making for determining the spatial extent or boundaries of interventions in the UK. These data are available in near real-time, and allow quantification of changes in the distribution of the population across the UK, as well as people's travel patterns to give data-driven metrics for geographically-targeted interventions.",Hamish Gibbs; Emily Nightingale; Yang Liu; James Cheshire; Leon Danon; Liam Smeeth; Carl AB Pearson; Chris Grundy; - LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 Working Group; Adam J Kucharski; Rosalind M Eggo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219550,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219550,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True

OBJECTIVES: To characterize the population that performed the SARS-CoV-2 molecular and serological tests in Carlos Chagas-Sabin laboratories in Cuiaba. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out with all the samples collected from nasal swab tested by RT-PCR and serological for SARM-CoV-2 IgM / IgG from the population served between April and July 2020. FINDINGS: In the analyzed period, 11,113 PCR-Covid-19 exams were registered. Of this total of cases, 3,912 (35.20%) tested positive, while 6,889 (61.90%) did not detect viral RNA and 312 (2.80%) of the visits resulted as undetermined. The peak of positive RT-PCR performed in July (n = 5878), with 35.65% (n = 2096). A total of 6,392 tests performed on SOROVID-19, with a peak of 1161 (18.16%) of the positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in July. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Molecular positivity and serological tests, both peaked in July 2020, were mostly present in women aged 20-39, characterizing Cuiaba as the epicenter of the Midwest region in this period due to the high rate of transmissibility of SARS- CoV-2.

This type of a spread pattern was not seen during the first wave of the pandemic the world over. Indeed when the disease had first appeared, in the accelerating stage the spread pattern was observed to have followed a highly nonlinear pattern that could be said to be approximately exponential or sub-exponential. As to why in the resurgence the growth has become hyper-exponential is another matter. But this has been happening in Europe and how long this would continue cannot be predicted. It may so happen that in the countries in which retardation has already been taking place, there may be resurgence of the disease.

Methods: We retrospectively examined COVID-19 incidence in 20 counties that held mass-gathering rallies (19 outdoor and 1 indoor), in August-September 2020 in the United States. We utilized a 7-day moving average and compared the change on the gathering date and 15 days later, based on the 95% confidence interval. Results: In the two weeks following the gatherings, the COVID-19 incidence increased significantly in 14 of 20 counties. The county with the highest incidence increase (3.8-fold) had the 2nd lowest incidence before the gathering. The county with the highest decrease (0.4-fold) had the 3rd highest incidence before the gathering. At the gathering date, the average incidence of counties with gatherings was lower than the rest of the United States, and after the gathering, it increased 1.5-fold, while the rest of the United States increased 1.02-fold. Conclusion: These results suggest that even outdoor gatherings in areas with low COVID-19 incidence are followed by increased infections, and that further precautions should be taken at such gatherings.",Oren Miron; Kun-Hsing Yu; Rachel Wilf-Miron; Nadav Davidovich,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20184630,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20184630,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
76,Development of Multiplexed RT-LAMP for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Viral RNA,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the utility of widespread molecular testing for surveillance and diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2. Reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has enabled testing outside of the standard clinical laboratory PCR infrastructure, with simple and rapid tests supplementing the existing, standard methods. However, current LAMP tests have detected single targets and required separate reactions for controls or multiple targets. As flu season arrives in the Northern Hemisphere the ability to screen for multiple viral targets will be increasingly important, and the ability to include internal control assays in the RT-LAMP test allows for decreased resource use and increased throughput. Here we describe a multiplexing approach to RT-LAMP with four targets (SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, and internal control human RNA) in a single reaction using real-time and endpoint fluorescence detection. This increase to the functionality of RT-LAMP will, we hope, enable even broader adoption of this power molecular testing approach to aid in the global fight against this continuing public health threat.",Yinhua Zhang; Nathan A Tanner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219972,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219972,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
77,A2B-COVID: A method for evaluating potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission events,"Identifying linked cases of infection is a key part of the public health response to viral infectious disease. Viral genome sequence data is of great value in this task, but requires careful analysis, and may need to be complemented by additional types of data. The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for analytical methods which bring together sources of data to inform epidemiological investigations. We here describe A2B-COVID, an approach for the rapid identification of linked cases of coronavirus infection. Our method combines knowledge about infection dynamics, data describing the movements of individuals, and novel approaches to genome sequence data to assess whether or not cases of infection are consistent or inconsistent with linkage via transmission. We apply our method to analyse and compare data collected from two wards at Cambridge University Hospitals, showing qualitatively different patterns of linkage between cases on designated Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 wards. Our method is suitable for the rapid analysis of data from clinical or other potential outbreak settings.",Christopher J R Illingworth; William L Hamilton; Christopher H Jackson; Ashley Popay; Luke Meredith; Charlotte J Houldcroft; Myra Hosmillo; Aminu Jahun; Matthew Routledge; Ben Warne; Laura Caller; Sarah Caddy; Anna Yakovleva; Grant Hall; Fahad A Khokhar; Theresa Feltwell; Malte Pinckert; Iliana Georgana; Yasmin Chaudhry; Martin Curran; Surendra Parmar; Dominic Sparkes; Lucy Rivett; Nick K Jones; Sushmita Sridhar; Sally Forest; Tom Dymond; Kayleigh Grainger; Chris Workman; Effrossyni Gkrania-Klotsas; Nicholas M Brown; Michael Weekes; Stephen Baker; Sharon J Peacock; Theodore Gouliouris; Ian G.

78,Disruptions to schistosomiasis programmes due to COVID-19: an analysis of potential impact and mitigation strategies,"Background: The 2030 goal for schistosomiasis is elimination as a public health problem (EPHP), with mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel to school-aged children (SAC) a central pillar of the strategy. However, due to COVID-19, many mass treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis have been halted with uncertain implications for the programmes. Method: We use mathematical modelling to explore how postponement of MDA and various mitigation strategies affect achievement of the EPHP goal for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium. Results: In moderate and some high prevalence settings, the disruption may delay the goal by up to two years. In some high prevalence settings EPHP is not achievable with current strategies, and so the disruption will not impact this. Here, increasing SAC coverage and treating adults can achieve the goal. The impact of MDA disruption and the appropriate mitigation strategy varies according to the baseline prevalence prior to treatment, the burden of infection in adults and stage of the programme. Conclusions: Schistosomiasis MDA programmes in medium and high prevalence areas should restart as soon as is feasible, and mitigation strategies may be required in some settings.",KLODETA KURA; Diepreye Ayabina; Jaspreet Toor; T.

79,Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on eliminating trachoma as a public health problem,"Background: Progress towards elimination of trachoma as a public health problem has been substantial, but the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted community-based control efforts. Methods: We use a susceptible-infected model to estimate the impact of delayed distribution of azithromycin treatment on the prevalence of active trachoma. Results: We identify three distinct scenarios for geographic districts depending on whether the basic reproduction number and the treatment-associated reproduction number are above or below a value of one. We find that when the basic reproduction number is below one, no significant delays in disease control will be caused. However, when the basic reproduction number is above one, significant delays can occur. In most districts a year of COVID-related delay can be mitigated by a single extra round of mass drug administration. However, supercritical districts require a new paradigm of infection control because the current strategies will not eliminate disease. Conclusion: If the pandemic can motivate judicious, community-specific implementation of control strategies, global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem could be accelerated.",Seth Blumberg; Anna Borlase; Joaquin M Prada; Anthony W Solomon; Paul Emerson; Pamela J Hooper; Michael S.

80,Symptoms at presentation for patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19: results from the ISARIC prospective multinational observational study,"Background Symptom recognition is necessary to identify people with possible Covid-19. Clinical case definitions vary in type and number of symptoms included. No large studies have investigated how these perform for hospitalized patients of different ages and sex. Methods We used international prospective observational data from patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19. We investigated how symptoms varied by age and sex. We performed logistic regression to assess the relationship of age and sex with the most prevalent symptoms in our dataset and with published case definitions, allowing for clustering by country as a random intercept. Results 60,161 patients from 43 countries were included, with median age 70 years (interquartile range 55 - 82). Fever (68%), cough (68%) and shortness of breath (63%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Their prevalence was greater among patients aged 30 - 60 years (respectively 79%, 78%, 66%), and lower in children ([&le;]18 years: 68%, 47%, 22%) and older adults ([&ge;]70 years: 61%, 62%, 61%). The most sensitive case definition assessed was one or more of cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle pains or sore throat, met by 92% of the whole cohort. Confusion was the most prevalent symptom for patients whose symptoms did not meet any of the assessed case definitions. Regression models showed significant differences in symptoms with age, and considerable heterogeneity between countries. Conclusions Older adults and children admitted to hospital with Covid-19 are less likely to present with typical symptoms of cough, fever and shortness of breath.

Purpose: To investigate the staging duration and classification of CT images of patients with COVID-19 based on quantitative analysis. Materials and Methods: This is an ambispective observational cohort study based on 125 patients with COVID-19 from Jan 23 to Feb 28, 2020. The stage of CT and pulmonary lesion size were quantitatively analyzed. The categorical regression analysis based on optimal scale (CATREG) was performed to evaluate the association of CT score, age, and gender with the clinical type. Results: The CT images of 125 patients with COVID-19 (50.13 plus-or-minus 16.91 years, 66 women) were analyzed in this study. Except for pre-early stage, the duration of early, progression-consolidation, and dissipation stage of CT images was 3.40 plus-or-minus 2.31, 10.07 plus-or-minus 4.91, and 20.60 plus-or-minus 7.64 days, respectively. The median CT score was 5.00 (2.00-8.50) during the first 30 days, which reached a peak on the 11th day. Significant differences were found between the median CT scores of different clinical types (P less than 0.05). Besides, the age was correlated with the clinical type (P less than 0.001), the CT scores of 0.00-11.50, 11.50-16.00, and 16.00-20.00 were separately correlated with the moderate, severe, and critical type with the output accuracy 69.60%.

83,Head-to-head comparison of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test with self-collected anterior nasal swab versus professional-collected nasopharyngeal swab,"Background: Two antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are now approved through the WHO Emergency Use Listing procedure and can be performed at the point-of-care. However, both tests use nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. NP swab samples must be collected by trained healthcare personnel with protective equipment and are frequently perceived as uncomfortable by patients. Methods: This was a manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study with comparison of a supervised, self-collected anterior nasal (AN) swab sample with a professional-collected NP swab sample, using a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT, STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD Biosensor), which is also being distributed by Roche. The reference standard was RT-PCR from an oro-/nasopharyngeal swab sample. Percent positive and negative agreement as well as sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results: Among the 289 participants, 39 (13.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The positive percent agreement of the two different sampling techniques for the Ag-RDT was 90.6% (CI 75.8-96.8). The negative percent agreement was 99.2% (CI 97.2-99.8). The Ag-RDT with AN sampling showed a sensitivity of 74.4% (29/39 PCR positives detected; CI 58.9-85.4) and specificity of 99.2% (CI 97.1-99.8) compared to RT-PCR. The sensitivity with NP sampling was 79.5% (31/39 PCR positives detected; CI 64.5-89.2) and specificity was 99.6% (CI 97.8-100). In patients with high viral load (>7.0 log10 RNA SARS-CoV2/swab), the sensitivity of the Ag-RDT with AN sampling was 96% and 100% with NP sampling. Conclusion: Supervised self-sampling from the anterior nose is a reliable alternative to professional nasopharyngeal sampling using a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. Considering the ease-of-use of Ag-RDTs, self-sampling and potentially patient self-testing at home may be a future use case.",Andreas K.

However, whether age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score (CCIS) predict fatal outcomes remains uncertain. This retrospective, nationwide cohort study was performed to evaluate patient mortality and clinical outcome according to CCIS among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. We included 5,621 patients who had been discharged from isolation or had died from COVID-19 by April 30, 2020. The primary outcome was composites of death, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The secondary outcome was mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate CCIS as the independent risk factor for death. Among 5,621 patients, the high CCIS ([&ge;]3) group showed higher proportion of elderly population and lower plasma hemoglobin and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts. The high CCIS group was an independent risk factor for composite outcome (HR 3.63, 95% CI 2.45-5.37, P < 0.001) and patient mortality (HR 22.96, 95% CI 7.20-73.24, P < 0.001).

86,The spatio-temporal landscape of lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Recent studies have provided insights into the pathology and immune response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However thorough interrogation of the interplay between infected cells and the immune system at sites of infection is lacking. We use high parameter imaging mass cytometry targeting the expression of 36 proteins, to investigate at single cell resolution, the cellular composition and spatial architecture of human acute lung injury including SARS-CoV-2. This spatially resolved, single-cell data unravels the disordered structure of the infected and injured lung alongside the distribution of extensive immune infiltration. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells and induces a localized hyper-inflammatory cell state associated with lung damage. By leveraging the temporal range of COVID-19 severe fatal disease in relation to the time of symptom onset, we observe increased macrophage extravasation, mesenchymal cells, and fibroblasts abundance concomitant with increased proximity between these cell types as the disease progresses, possibly as an attempt to repair the damaged lung tissue. This spatially resolved single-cell data allowed us to develop a biologically interpretable landscape of lung pathology from a structural, immunological and clinical standpoint.

Methods: This was an ambispective observational cohort study, and 133 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and all symptoms over the course were analyzed qualitatively. The symptoms, their changes over the course in the cohort and in the different clinical types, etc. were illustrated. Differences in different periods and severities were analyzed through Chi square test, association with severity was analyzed through LASSO binomial logistic regression analysis. Inter-correlation and classification of symptoms were completed. Major symptoms were screened and their changes were illustrated. Results: A total of 43 symptoms with frequencies as 6067 in this cohort. Differences of symptoms in different stages and clinical types were significant. Expectoration, shortness of breath, dyspnea, diarrhea, poor appetite were positively but vomiting, waist discomfort, pharyngeal discomfort, acid reflux were negatively correlated with the combined-severe and critical type; dyspnea was correlated with the critical type. The 17 major symptoms were identified. The average daily frequency of symptoms per case was decreased continuously before the transition into the severe type and increased immediately one day before the transition and then decreased. It was decreased continuously before the transition date of the critical type and increased from the transition into the critical type to the next day and decreased thereafter. Dyspnea (P less than 0.001), shortness of breath (P less than 0.01) and chest distress (P less than 0.05) were correlated with death and their corresponding coefficient was 0.393, 0.258, 0.214, respectively. Conclusion: The symptoms of COVID-19 patients mainly related to upper respiratory tract infection, cardiopulmonary function, and digestive system. The mild type and the early stage in other types mainly related to upper respiratory tract infection. The cardiopulmonary function and digestive system associated symptoms were found in all other types and stages. Dyspnea was correlated with critical type and dyspnea, shortness of breath, and chest distress were correlated with death.

89,"Declining prevalence of antibody positivity to SARS-CoV-2: a community study of 365,000 adults","Background The prevalence and persistence of antibodies following a peak SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into its spread in the community, the likelihood of reinfection and potential for some level of population immunity. Methods Prevalence of antibody positivity in England, UK (REACT2) with three cross-sectional surveys between late June and September 2020. 365104 adults used a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG. A laboratory comparison of LFIA results to neutralization activity in panel of sera was performed. Results There were 17,576 positive tests over the three rounds. Antibody prevalence, adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England, declined from 6.0% [5.8, 6.1], to 4.8% [4.7, 5.0] and 4.4% [4.3, 4.5], a fall of 26.5% [-29.0, -23.8] over the three months of the study. There was a decline between rounds 1 and 3 in all age groups, with the highest prevalence of a positive result and smallest overall decline in positivity in the youngest age group (18-24 years: -14.9% [-21.6, -8.1]), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (75+ years: -39.0% [-50.8, -27.2]); there was no change in antibody positivity between rounds 1 and 3 in healthcare workers (+3.45% [-5.7, +12.7]). The decline from rounds 1 to 3 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID-19, (-64.0% [-75.6, -52.3]), compared to -22.3% ([-27.0, -17.7]) in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on PCR. Discussion These findings provide evidence of variable waning in antibody positivity over time such that, at the start of the second wave of infection in England, only 4.4% of adults had detectable IgG antibodies using an LFIA. Antibody positivity was greater in those who reported a positive PCR and lower in older people and those with asymptomatic infection.

90,"Transmission of COVID-19 in 282 clusters in Catalonia, Spain: a cohort study","Background There remains limited data on what variables affect the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and developing symptomatic Covid-19 and in particular the relationship to viral load (VL). Methods We analysed data collected in a trial of hydroxychloroquine post-exposure prophylaxis. Covid-19 cases and their contacts were identified through the local epidemiological surveillance system. VL, estimated by quantitative PCR, was assessed at enrollment, at day 14, and whenever the participant reported Covid-19-like symptoms. Risk of transmission, risk of developing symptomatic disease and incubation dynamics were evaluated using random-effects regression analysis. Findings We identified 314 cases, 282 of which had at least one contact (753 contacts in total). Ninety (33%) of 282 clusters had at least one transmission event. The secondary attack rate was 16% (125/753), with a variation from 12% to 24% for VL of the index case of <106, and >109 copies/mL, respectively (OR per log10 increase in VL 1.3 95%CI 1.1 to 1.6). Increased risk of transmission was also associated with household contact (OR 2.7; 1.4 to 5.06) and age of the contact (OR 1.02; 1.01 to 1.04). The proportion of PCR positive contacts who developed symptomatic Covid-19 was 40.3% (181/449), with a variation from 25% to 60% for VL of the contact <107, and >109 copies/mL (HR log10 increase in VL 1.12; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.2). Time to onset of symptomatic disease decreased from a median of 7 days (IQR 5 to 10) for individuals with an initial viral load <107 to 6 days (4 to 8) and 5 days (3 to 8) for individuals with an initial viral load of 107 to 109 and >109, respectively.

91,Predicting the impact of COVID-19 interruptions on transmission of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis in two health zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo,"Many control programmes against neglected tropical diseases have been interrupted due to COVID-19 pandemic, including those that rely on active case finding. In this study we focus on gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), where active screening was suspended in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) due to the pandemic. We use two independent mathematical models to predict the impact of COVID-19 interruptions on transmission and reporting, and the achievement of 2030 elimination of transmission (EOT) goal for gHAT in two moderate-risk regions of DRC. We consider different interruption scenarios, including reduced passive surveillance in fixed health facilities, and whether this suspension lasts until the end of 2020 or 2021. Our models predict an increase in the number of new infections in the interruption period only if both active screening and passive surveillance were suspended, and with slowed reduction - but no increase - if passive surveillance remains fully functional. In all scenarios, the EOT may be slightly pushed back if no mitigation such as increased screening coverage is put in place. However, we emphasise that the biggest challenge will remain in the higher prevalence regions where EOT is already predicted to be behind schedule without interruptions unless interventions are bolstered.",Maryam Aliee; Soledad Castano; Christopher Davis; Swati Patel; Erick Mwamba Miaka; Simon EF Spencer; Matt J Keeling; Nakul Chitnis; Kat S Rock,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219485,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219485,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
92,"A methodological blueprint to identify COVID-19 vulnerable locales by socioeconomic factors, developed using South Korean data","COVID-19 has more severely impacted socioeconomically (SES) disadvantaged populations. Lack of SES measurements and inaccurately identifying high-risk locales can hamper COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Using South Korean COVID-19 incidence data (January 20 through July 1, 2020) and established social theoretical approaches, we identified COVID-19-specific SES factors. Principal component analysis created composite indexes for each SES factor, while Geographically Weighted Negative Binomial Regressions mapped a continuous surface of COVID-19 risk for South Korea. High area morbidity, risky health behaviors, crowding, and population mobility elevated area risk for COVID-19, while improved social distancing, healthcare access, and education decreased it. Our results indicated that falling SES-related COVID-19 risks and spatial shift patterns over three consecutive time periods reflected the implementation of reportedly effective public health interventions. While validating earlier studies, this study introduced a methodological blueprint for precision targeting of high-risk locales that is globally applicable for COVID-19 and future pandemics.",Bayarmagnai Weinstein; Alan R. da Silva; Dimitrios E.

93,"Economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and public health measures: results from an anonymous online survey in Thailand, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Slovenia","In the absence of a vaccine and widely available treatments for COVID-19, governments have relied primarily on non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the pandemic. To aid understanding of the impact of these public health measures on different social groups we conducted a mixed-methods study in five countries ('SEBCOV' - Social, ethical and behavioural aspects of COVID-19). Here we report the results of the SEBCOV anonymous online survey of adults. Overall, 5,058 respondents from Thailand, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Slovenia completed the self-administered survey between May and June 2020. Post-stratification weighting was applied, and associations between categorical variables assessed. Among the five countries, Thai respondents appeared to have been most, and Slovenian respondents least, affected economically. Overall, lower education levels, larger households, having children under 18 in the household, being 65 years or older and having flexible/no income were associated with worse economic impact. Regarding social impact, respondents expressed most concern about their social life, physical health, and mental health and wellbeing. There were large differences between countries in terms of voluntary behavioural change, and in compliance and agreement with COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, self-reported compliance was higher among respondents reporting a high understanding of COVID-19. UK respondents felt able to cope the longest and Thai respondents the shortest with only going out for essential needs or work, with 60% and 26% respectively able to cope with 29 days or longer. Many respondents reported seeing news that seemed fake to them, the proportion varying between countries, and with education level and self-reported levels of understanding of COVID-19. Our data showed that COVID-19 public health measures have uneven economic and social impacts on people from different countries and social groups.

94,Co-infection in critically ill patients with COVID-19: An observational cohort study from England,"Objective: To describe the incidence and nature of co-infection in critically ill adults with COVID-19 infection in England. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of adults with COVID-19 admitted to seven intensive care units (ICUs) in England up to 18 May 2020, was performed. Patients with completed ICU stays were included. The proportion and type of organisms were determined at <48 and >48 hours following hospital admission, corresponding to community and hospital-acquired co-infections. Results: Of 254 patients studied (median age 59 years (IQR 49-69); 64.6% male), 139 clinically significant organisms were identified from 83(32.7%) patients. Bacterial co-infections were identified within 48 hours of admission in 14(5.5%) patients; the commonest pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (four patients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (two patients). The proportion of pathogens detected increased with duration of ICU stay, consisting largely of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The co-infection rate >48 hours after admission was 27/1000 person-days (95% CI 21.3-34.1). Patients with co-infections were more likely to die in ICU (crude OR 1.78,95% CI 1.03-3.08, p=0.04) compared to those without co-infections.

95,The Incidence and Severity of COVID-19 in Adult Professional Soccer Players,"Introduction At present, there are no data regarding the incidence and clinical course of COVID-19 among professional soccer players, and the studies examining putative complications of COVID-19 infections are probabilistic. Thus, examining the incidence of COVID-19 and various aspects of its clinical course in a group of adult professional soccer players would be of great practical interest. Methods The incidence, clinical course, and severity of COVID-19 infection, as well as the duration of treatment and return to play were studied by the questioning of the team physicians and medical records assessment in the group of adult professional soccer players representing the clubs of the Russian Premier-League (RPL) during the period of championship resumption from 01.04.2020 until 20.09.2020. Results COVID-19 infection was detected in 103 soccer players in the course of COVID-19 screening. This number comprises 14.5% of all soccer players which were on the rosters of RPL soccer teams and which were subject to regular COVID-19 testing. The asymptomatic course was observed in 43.7% of cases (n=45). These players were isolated and their clinical condition was monitored closely. Clinical symptoms were observed in 56.3% of cases (n=58), the most common symptoms being fatigue, headache, fever, and anosmia.

96,"Management of Acute Appendicitis in Children: Takeaway from Coronavirus Disease-2019, a Perspective of Pediatric Surgeons from South Asia","Background: Non-operative treatment (NOT) of pediatric appendicitis as opposed to surgery elicits great debate and potentially influenced by the preferences of the physician. Owing to the effects of the COVID pandemic on healthcare, practice of NOT has generally increased by necessity and may, in a post-COVID world, change surgeons perceptions of NOT. Objective: The objective was to determine if the practice of NOT has increased in usage in South Asia and whether these levels of practice would be sustained after the pandemic subside. Methods: A survey was addressed to pediatric surgeons regarding their position, institute, country, number of appendicitis cases managed and their mode of treatment between identical time periods in 2019 and 2020 (April 1 to August 31). It also directly posed the question as to whether they would continue with the COVID imposed level of NOT after the effect of the pandemic diminishes. Results: A total of 134 responses were collected. A significant increase in the practice of NOT was observed for the entire cohort, though no effect was observed when grouped by country or institute. When grouped by position, seniors increased the practice of NOT the most, while juniors reported the least change. The data suggests that only Professors would be inclined to maintaining the COVID level of NOT practice after the pandemic. Conclusions: Increased practice of NOT during the COVID pandemic was observed in South Asia, particularly by senior surgeons. Only Professors appear inclined to consider maintaining this increased level of practice in the post-COVID world.",Md Jafrul Hannan; Mosammat Kohinnor Parveen; Md Mozammel Hoque; Tanvir Kabir Chowdhury; Md Samiul Hasan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.27.20220442,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.27.20220442,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,,True
97,Lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis secondary to severe COVID-19,"Lung transplantation can potentially be a life-saving treatment for patients with non-resolving COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome. Concerns limiting transplant include recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the allograft, technical challenges imposed by viral-mediated injury to the native lung, and potential risk for allograft infection by pathogens associated with ventilator-induced pneumonia in the native lung. Additionally, the native lung might recover, resulting in long-term outcomes preferable to transplant. Here, we report the results of the first two successful lung transplantation procedures in patients with non-resolving COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome in the United States. We performed smFISH to detect both positive and negative strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the explanted lung tissue, extracellular matrix imaging using SHIELD tissue clearance, and single cell RNA-Seq on explant and warm post-mortem lung biopsies from patients who died from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Lungs from patients with prolonged COVID-19 were free of virus but pathology showed extensive evidence of injury and fibrosis which resembled end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Single cell RNA-Seq of the explanted native lungs from transplant and paired warm post-mortem autopsies showed similarities between late SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome and irreversible end-stage pulmonary fibrosis requiring lung transplantation. There was no recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 or pathogens associated with pre-transplant ventilator-associated pneumonias following transplantation in either patient.

98,Is increased mortality by multiple exposures to COVID-19 an overseen factor when aiming for herd immunity?,"Background: Governments across the globe responded with different strategies to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries adapted draconic measures, which have been perceived controversial others pursued a strategy aiming for herd immunity. The latter is even more controversial and has been called unethical by the WHO Director-General. Inevitably, without proper control measure, viral diversity increases and multiple infectious exposures become common, when the pandemic reaches its maximum. This harbors not only a potential threat overseen by simplified theoretical arguments in support of herd immunity, but also deserves attention when assessingresponse measures to increasing numbers of infection. Methods and findings: We extend the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness web interface CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to study the hypothetical effect of increased morbidity and mortality due to 'multi infections', either acquired at by successive infective contacts during the course of one infection or by a single infective contact with a multi-infected individual. The simulations are adjusted to reflect roughly the situation in the East Coast of the USA. We assume a phase of general contact reduction ('lockdown') at the beginning of the epidemic and additional case-isolation measures. We study the hypothetical effects of varying enhancements in morbidity and mortality, different likelihoods of multi-infected individuals to spread multi infections and different susceptibility to multi infectious in different disease phases. It is demonstrated that multi infections lead to a slight reduction in the number of infections, as these are more likely to get isolated due to their higher morbidity. However, the latter substantially increases the number of deaths. Furthermore, simulations indicate that a potential second lockdown can substantially decrease the epidemic peak, the number of multi-infections and deaths. Conclusions: Enhanced morbidity and mortality due to multiple disease exposure is a potential threat in the COVID-19 pandemic that deserves more attention. Particularly it underlines another facet questioning disease management strategies aiming for herd immunity",Kristina Barbara Helle; Arlinda Sadiku; Girma Mesfin Zelleke; Aliou Bouba; Toheeb Babantunde Ibrahim; Henri Christian Junior Tsoungui Obama; Vincent Appiah; Gideon A.

Objectives: The paper aims to understand if different socioeconomic factors have a role to play in determining the intensity of COVID-19 impact. Methods: The study uses a country-wise number of corona cases and deaths and analyse them in a cross-country multivariate regression framework. It uses gross domestic product per capita, average temperature, population density, and median age as independent variables. The study uses testing data as a control variable. Results: In absence of the testing variable, higher-income countries have experienced a higher number of COVID cases. The population density, median age, climate do not have significant impact. The countries with higher population density have lower deaths. Each region shows different patterns of correlation between socioeconomic factors and COVID intensity. Conclusion: The majority of the cross-country variation can be attributed to the number of tests done by a country. The countries with high population density would have applied strict lockdowns and proactive testing to curb the deaths.

Its diagnosis relies on molecular methods, with drawbacks revealed by current use as mass screening. Monocyte CD169 upregulation has been reported as a marker of viral infections, we evaluated a flow cytometry three-color rapid assay of whole blood monocyte CD169 for CoVID-19 screening. Outpatients (n=177) with confirmed CoVID-19 infection, comprising 80 early-stage ([&le;]14 days after symptom onset), 71 late-stage ([&ge;]15 days), and 26 asymptomatic patients received whole blood CD169 testing in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Upregulation of monocyte CD169 without polymorphonuclear neutrophil CD64 changes was the primary endpoint. Sensitivity was 98% and 100% in early-stage and asymptomatic patients respectively, specificity was 50% and 84%. Rapid whole blood monocyte CD169 evaluation was highly sensitive when compared with RT-PCR, especially in early-stage, asymptomatic patients whose RT-PCR tests were not yet positive. Diagnostic accuracy, easy finger prick sampling and minimal time-to-result (15-30 minutes) rank whole blood monocyte CD169 upregulation as a potential screening and diagnostic support for CoVID-19.

The main goal of this study is a comparative analysis of some European countries with a longer and shorter period of national lockdown during the first wave of COVID-19 from March to August 2020. Findings suggests that: a) countries with shorter period of lockdown have a variation of confirmed cases/population (%) higher than countries with longer period of lockdown; b) countries with shorter period of lockdown have average fatality rate (5.45%) lower than countries with longer period of lockdown (12.70%), whereas variation of fatality rate from August to March 2020 suggests a higher reduction in countries with longer period of lockdown (-1.9% vs 0.72%). However, Independent Samples Test and the Mann-Whitney test reveal that the effectiveness of longer period of lockdown versus shorter one on public health is not significant. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic associated with longer period of lockdown has a higher negative impact on economic growth with consequential social issues in countries.

103,"Transmission of COVID-19 in the state of Georgia, United States: Spatiotemporal variation and impact of social distancing","Background Beginning in early February 2020, COVID-19 spread across the state of Georgia leading to 258,354 cumulative cases as of August 25, 2020. The time scale of spreading (i.e., serial interval) and magnitude of spreading (i.e., Rt or reproduction number) for COVID-19, were observed to be heterogenous by demographic characteristics, region and time period. In this study, we examined the COVID-19 transmission in the state of Georgia, United States. Methods During February 1-July 13, 2020, we identified 4080 transmission pairs using contact information from reports of COVID-19 cases from the Georgia Department of Public Health. We examined how various transmission characteristics were affected by disease symptoms, demographics (age, gender, and race), and time period (during shelter-in-place and after reopening). In addition, we estimated the time course of reproduction numbers during early February-mid-June for all 159 counties in the state of Georgia, using a total of 118,491 reported COVID-19 cases. Findings Over this period, the serial interval appeared to decrease from 5.97 days in February-April to 4.40 days in June-July. With regard to age, transmission was assortative and patterns of transmission changed over time. COVID-19 mainly spread from adults to all age groups; transmission among and between children and the elderly was found less frequently. Younger adults (20-50 years old) were involved in the majority of transmissions occurring during or after reopening subsequent to the shelter-in-place period. By mid-July, two waves of COVID-19 transmission were apparent, separated by the shelter-in-place period in the state of Georgia. Counties around major cities and along interstate highways had more intense transmission. Interpretation The transmission of COVID-19 in the state of Georgia had been heterogeneous by area and changed over time. The shelter-in-place was not long enough to sufficiently suppress COVID-19 transmission in densely populated urban areas connected by major transportation links. Studying local transmission patterns may help in predicting and guiding states in prevention and control of COVID-19 according to population and region.

To help inform successful COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in the UK and US, we conducted a survey to quantify how online misinformation impacts COVID-19 vaccine uptake intent and identify socio-economic groups that are most at-risk of non-vaccination and most susceptible to online misinformation. Here, we report findings from nationally representative surveys in the UK and the US conducted in September 2020. We show that recent misinformation around a COVID-19 vaccine induces a fall in vaccination intent among those who would otherwise 'definitely' vaccinate by 6.4 (3.8, 9.0) percentages points in the UK and 2.4 (0.1, 5.0) in the US, with larger decreases found in intent to vaccinate to protect others. We find evidence that socio-econo-demographic, political, and trust factors are associated with low intent to vaccinate and susceptibility to misinformation: notably, older age groups in the US are more susceptible to misinformation. We find evidence that scientific-sounding misinformation relating to COVID-19 and vaccines COVID-19 vaccine misinformation lowers vaccination intent, while corresponding factual information does not.

Methods: The number of daily total confirmed cases, total confirmed new cases, total deaths and total new deaths of COVID-19 from 8 March 2020 to 16 October, 2020 was collected to fit an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast the spread of COVID-19 in Bangladesh from 17th October 2020 to 15th November 2020. All statistical analyses were conducted using R-3.6.3 software with a significant level of p< 0.05. Results: The ARIMA (0,2,1) and ARIMA (0,1,1) model was adopted for forecasting the number of daily total confirmed cases, total deaths and total confirmed new cases, new deaths of COVID-19, respectively. The results showed that an upward trend for the total confirmed cases and total deaths, while total confirmed new cases and total new death, will become stable in the next 30 days if prevention measures are strictly followed to limit the spread of COVID-19.

107,Severity of COVID-19 at elevated exposure to perfluorinated alkylates,"Background The course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to be aggravated by air pollution, and some industrial chemicals, such as the perfluorinated alkylate substances (PFASs), are immunotoxic and may contribute as well. Methods From Danish biobanks, we obtained plasma samples from 323 subjects aged 30-70 years with known SARS-CoV-2 infection. The PFAS concentrations measured at the background exposures included five PFASs known to be immunotoxic. Register data was obtained to classify disease status, other health information, and demographic variables. We used ordinal and ordered logistic regression analyses to determine associations between PFAS concentrations and disease outcome. Results Plasma-PFAS concentrations were higher in males, in subjects with Western European background, and tended to increase with age, but were not associated with the presence of chronic disease. Of the study population, 108 (33%) had not been hospitalized, and of those hospitalized, 53 (16%) had been in intensive care or were deceased. Among the five PFASs considered, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) showed an odds ratio (OR) of 2.19 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.39-3.46) for increasing severities of the disease, although the OR decreased to 1.77 (95% CI, 1.09, 2.87) after adjustment for age, sex, sampling site and interval between blood sampling and diagnosis. Conclusions Measures of individual exposures to immunotoxic PFASs included PFBA that accumulates in the lungs. Elevated plasma-PFBA concentrations were associated with an increased risk of more severe course of CIVID-19.

108,"Digital contact-tracing during the Covid-19 pandemic: an analysis of newspaper coverage in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland","Governments around the globe have started to develop and deploy digital contact tracing apps to gain control over the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). The appropriateness and usefulness of these technologies as a containment measure have since sparked political and academic discussions globally. The present paper contributes to this debate through an exploration of how the national daily newspapers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland reported on the development and adoption of digital contact-tracing apps during early and after stages of the lockdown. These countries were among the first in Europe to develop apps and were critical voices in the debate of decentralized vs. centralized data processing. We conducted thematic analysis on news coverage published between January and May 2020 in high-circulation national daily newspapers (print) from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. A total of 148 newspaper articles were included in the final analysis. From our analysis emerged six core themes of the development and adoption of digital contact tracing apps: 1) data governance; 2) role of IT giants; 3) scientific rigor; 4) voluntariness; 5) functional efficacy; 6) role of the app. These results shed light on the different facets of discussion regarding digital contact tracing as portrayed in German-speaking media. As news coverage can serve as a proxy for public perception, this study complements emerging survey data on public perceptions of digital contact tracing apps by identifying potential issues of public concern.",Julia Amann; Joanna Sleigh; Effy Vayena,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216788,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216788,2020-10-26,2020-10-26,,True
109,"Characteristics associated with household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Ontario, Canada","BACKGROUND: Within-household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified as one of the main sources of spread of COVID-19 after lockdown restrictions and self-isolation guidelines are implemented. Secondary attack rates among household contacts are estimated to be five to ten times higher than among non-household contacts, but it is unclear which individuals are more prone to transmit infection within their households. METHODS: Using address matching, a cohort was assembled of all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 residing in private households in Ontario, Canada. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare characteristics of cases in households that experienced secondary transmission versus those that did not. Logistic regression models were fit to determine index case characteristics and neighbourhood characteristics associated with transmission. FINDINGS: Between January and July, 2020, there were 26,152 cases of COVID-19 residing in 21,226 households. Longer testing delays ([&ge;]5 days versus 0 days OR=3.02, 95% CI: 2.53 - 3.60) and male sex (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.38) were associated with greater odds of household secondary transmission, while being a healthcare worker (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.62) was associated with lower odds of transmission. Neighbourhoods with larger average economic family size and a higher proportion of households with multiple persons per room were also associated with greater odds of transmission. INTERPRETATION: It is important for individuals to get tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as symptoms appear, and to isolate away from household contacts; this is particularly important in neighbourhoods with large family sizes and/or crowded households.",Lauren A.

110,Hardness of Herd Immunity and Success Probability of Quarantine Measures: A Branching Process Approach,"We model the propagation of an infection, in a population, as a simplified age-dependent branching process. We analytically estimate the fraction of population, needed to be infected or immuned, to achieve herd immunity for an infection. We calculate this estimation as a function of the incubation period of the contagion, contact probability among the infected and susceptible population, and the probability of disease transmission from an infected to a susceptible individual. We show how herd immunity is strongly dependent on the incubation period, and it may be extremely difficult to achieve herd immunity in case of large incubation period. We derive the distribution of generation time from basic principles, which, by far, has been assumed in an ad hoc manner in epidemiological studies. We quantify the success probability of quarantine measures before achieving herd immunity, and discuss a novel method for designing effective quarantine measures in the absence of any pharmaceutical interventions. We also compare the effectiveness of an early imposition against a delayed imposition of lockdown, of the same duration, in mitigating infection from a population.",Sujit Kumar Nath,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216481,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216481,2020-10-26,2020-10-26,,True
111,Lockdown related travel behavior undermines thecontainment of SARS-CoV-2,"In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, unprecedented policies of travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders were enacted around the world. Ultimately, the public's response to announcements of lockdowns - defined here as restrictions on both local movement or long distance travel - will determine how effective these kinds of interventions are. Here, we measure the impact of the announcement and implementation of lockdowns on human mobility patterns by analyzing aggregated mobility data from mobile phones. We find that following the announcement of lockdowns, both local and long distance movement increased. To examine how these behavioral responses to lockdown policies may contribute to epidemic spread, we developed a simple agent-based spatial model. We find that travel surges following announcements of lockdowns can increase seeding of the epidemic in rural areas, undermining the goal of the lockdown of preventing disease spread. Appropriate messaging surrounding the announcement of lockdowns and measures to decrease unnecessary travel are important for preventing these unintended consequences of lockdowns.",Nishant Kishore; Rebecca Kahn; Pamela P Martinez; Pablo M De Salazar; Ayesha S Mahmud; Caroline Buckee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20217752,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20217752,2020-10-26,2020-10-26,,True

Methods: A total of 1,297 patients, admitted between March 18 and April 8, 2020, were stratified according to their risk of developing COVID-19 using their responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate symptoms and risk conditions. Results: Anosmia/hyposmia (p <0.0001), fever (p<0.0001), body pain (p<0.0001), and chills (p=0.001) were all independent predictors for COVID-19, with a 72% estimated probability for detecting COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Leukopenia, relative monocytosis, decreased eosinophil values, CRP, and platelets were also shown to be significant independent predictors for COVID-19. Conclusions: The significant clinical features for COVID-19 were identified as anosmia, fever, chills, and body pain. Elevated CRP, leukocytes under 5,400 x 109/L, and relative monocytosis (>9%) were common among patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

113,A theoretical analysis of the putative ORF10 protein in SARS-CoV-2,"Found just upstream of the 3'-untranslated region in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is the putative ORF10 which has been proposed to encode for the hypothetical ORF10 protein. Even though current research suggests this protein is not likely to be produced, further investigations into this protein are still warranted. Herein, this study uses multiple bioinformatic programs to theoretically characterize and construct the ORF10 protein in SARS-CoV-2. Results indicate this protein is mostly ordered and hydrophobic with high protein-binding propensity, especially in the N-terminus. Although minimal, an assessment of twenty-two missense mutations for this protein suggest slight changes in protein flexibility and hydrophobicity. When compared against two other protein models, this study's model was found to possess higher quality. As such, this model suggests the ORF10 protein contains a {beta}--{beta} motif with a {beta}-molecular recognition feature occurring as the first {beta}-strand. Furthermore, this protein also shares a strong phylogenetic relationship with other putative ORF10 protein's in closely related coronaviruses. Despite not yielding evidence for the existence of this protein within SARS-CoV-2, this study does present theoretical examinations that can serve as platforms to drive additional experimental work that assess the biological relevance of this hypothetical protein in SARS-CoV-2.",Noah Avery Schuster,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.355784,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.355784,2020-10-26,2020-10-26,,False
114,Structural basis of ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is the key event during translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome allowing synthesis of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and downstream viral proteins. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the mammalian ribosome in the process of translating viral RNA paused in a conformation primed for frameshifting. We observe that the viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure lodged at the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome to generate tension in the mRNA that leads to frameshifting. The nascent viral polyprotein that is being synthesized by the ribosome paused at the frameshifting site forms distinct interactions with the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel. We use biochemical experiments to validate our structural observations and to reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence the frameshifting efficiency. Finally, a compound previously shown to reduce frameshifting is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells, establishing coronavirus frameshifting as target for antiviral intervention.",Pramod R.

115,The genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Palestine,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to cause significant public health burden and disruption globally. Genomic epidemiology approaches point to most countries in the world having experienced many independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic. However, this situation may change with local lockdown policies and restrictions on travel leading to the emergence of more geographically structured viral populations and lineages transmitting locally. Here, we report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Palestine sampled from early March, when the first cases were observed, through to August of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Palestine fall across the diversity of the global phylogeny, consistent with at least nine independent introductions into the region. We identify one locally predominant lineage in circulation represented by 50 Palestinian SARS-CoV-2, grouping with isolated viral samples from patients in Israel and the UK. We estimate the age of introduction of this lineage to 05/02/2020 (16/01/2020 - 19/02/2020), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 was already in circulation in Palestine predating its first detection in Bethlehem in early March.

117,"SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T lymphocytes from COVID-19 convalescent donors: identification, biobanking and large scale production for Adoptive Cell Therapy","SARS-CoV-2 is causing a second outbreak so the hope for its complete eradication is far from happening. In the absence of effective vaccines, it is mandatory to find effective treatments with low adverse effects able to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease. In this work, we determined the existence of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells within the CD45RA- T memory cells from the blood of convalescent donors. Memory T cells can respond quickly to the infection and provide long-term immune protection to reduce the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Also, CD45RA- memory T cells confer protection from other pathogens the donors encountered in their life. This is vital to clear other secondary infections usually developed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T cells were found within all the CD45RA- subsets CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and in the central memory and effector memory subpopulations. The procedure to obtain the cells is feasible, easy to implement for small scale manufacture, quick and cost-effective involving minimal manipulation, and without GMP condition requirements.

118,"The Fc-mediated effector functions of a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, SC31, isolated from an early convalescent COVID-19 patient, are essential for the optimal therapeutic efficacy of the antibody","SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are promising therapeutics for COVID-19. However, little is known about the mechanisms of action of these antibodies or their effective dosing windows. We report the discovery and development of SC31, a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG1 antibody, originally isolated from a convalescent patient at day 27 after the onset of symptoms. Neutralization occurs via a binding epitope that maps within the ACE2 interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, conserved across all common circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutants. In SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice, SC31 demonstrated potent survival benefit by dramatically reducing viral load concomitant with attenuated pro-inflammatory responses linked to severe systemic disease, such as IL-6. Comparison with a Fc-null LALA variant of SC31 demonstrated that optimal therapeutic efficacy of SC31 requires intact Fc-mediated effector functions that can further induce an IFN{gamma}-driven anti-viral immune response. Dose-dependent efficacy for SC31 was observed down to 5mg/kg when dosed before the activation of lung inflammatory responses. Importantly, despite Fc{gamma}R binding, no evidence of antibody dependent enhancement was observed with the Fc-competent SC31 even at sub-therapeutic doses. Therapeutic efficacy was confirmed in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, where SC31 again significantly reduced viral load, decreased lung lesions and inhibited progression to severe disease manifestations. This study underlines the potential for significant COVID-19 patient benefit for the SC31 antibody that justifies rapid advancement to the clinic, as well as highlighting the importance of appropriate mechanistic and functional studies during development.",Conrad E.

119,Diversity of ACE2 and its interaction with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain,"COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has rapidly spread globally causing millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The potential animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are currently unknown, however sequence analysis has provided plausible potential candidate species. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enable its entry into host cells and establish infection. We analyzed the binding surface of ACE2 from several important animal species to begin to understand the parameters for the ACE2 recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We employed Shannon entropy analysis to determine the variability of ACE2 across its sequence and particularly in its RBD interacting region, and assessed differences between various species ACE2 and human ACE2. As cattle are a known reservoir for coronaviruses with previous human zoonotic transfer, and has a relatively divergent ACE2 sequence, we compared the binding kinetics of bovine and human ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This revealed a nanomolar binding affinity for bovine ACE2 but an approximate ten-fold reduction of binding compared to human ACE2. Since cows have been experimentally infected by SARS-CoV-2, this lower affinity sets a threshold for sequences with lower homology to human ACE2 to be able to serve as a productive viral receptor for SARS-CoV-2.",Jessie L Gan; Ruiqi Huang; Gabrielle Warner; Abigail Kelley; Duncan McGregor; Vaughn V.

122,The papain-like protease of coronaviruses cleaves ULK1 to disrupt host autophagy,"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 alongside the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 underscore the significance to understand betacoronaviruses as a global health challenge. SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent for COVID-19, has infected more than 29 million individuals worldwide with nearly ~1 million fatalities. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 initiates viral pathogenesis is of the utmost importance for development of antiviral drugs. Autophagy modulators have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2 but recent clinical setbacks underline the urgent need for better understanding the mechanism of viral subversion of autophagy. Using murine hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) as a model betacoronavirus, time-course infections revealed a significant loss in the protein level of ULK1, a canonical autophagy regulating serine-threonine kinase, and the concomitant appearance of a possible cleavage fragment. To investigate whether virus-encoded proteases target this protein, we conducted in vitro and cellular cleavage assays and identified ULK1 as a novel bona fide substrate of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Mutagenesis studies discovered that ULK1 is cleaved at a conserved PLpro recognition sequence (LGGG) after G499, separating its N-terminal kinase domain from the C-terminal substrate recognition region. Consistent with this, over-expression of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is sufficient to impair starvation-induced canonical autophagy and disrupt formation of ULK1-ATG13 complex. Finally, we demonstrated a dual role for ULK1 in MHV-A59 replication, serving a pro-viral functions during early replication that is inactivated at late stages of infection. In conclusion, our study identified a new mechanism by which PLpro of betacoronaviruses induces viral pathogenesis by targeting cellular autophagic pathway (Word count=250)

Eighty-three percent of patients received at least one course of antibiotics, despite low rates of microbiologically confirmed infection (12%). Almost one-third of patients (30%) received more than one course of antibiotics. There was a low rate of respiratory cultures obtained (32%). Risk factors identified in a univariate analysis for both antibiotic prescribing and receiving more than one course of antibiotics were more serious illness, increased hospital length of stay, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and ARDS.

124,Distinguishing non severe cases of dengue from COVID-19 in the context of co-epidemics: a cohort study in a SARS-CoV-2 testing center on Reunion island,"BackgroundAs coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading globally, several countries are handling dengue epidemics. As both infections are deemed to share similarities at presentation, it would be useful to distinguish COVID-19 from dengue in the context of co-epidemics. In this aim, we performed a cohort study to identify predictors of both infections.

MethodsAll the subjects suspected of COVID-19 between March 23 and May 10, 2020, were screened for COVID-19 within the testing center of the University hospital of Saint-Pierre, Reunion island. The screening consisted in a questionnaire surveyed in face-to-face, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction and a rapid diagnostic orientation test for dengue. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 or with dengue were sought using multinomial logistic regression models, taking other febrile illnesses (OFIs) as controls.

ResultsOver a two-month study period, we identified among 80 COVID-19, 60 non-severe dengue and 872 OFIs cases, delayed presentation (>3 days) since symptom onset (Odds ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.40), contact with a COVID-19 positive case (OR 3.81, 95%CI 2.12-6.82) and anosmia (OR 8.27, 95%CI 4.39-15.54) as independent predictors of COVID-19, body ache (OR 6.83, 95%CI 2.84-16.41), headache (OR 5.38, 95%CI 1.81-15.94) and retro-orbital pain (OR 7.45, 95%CI 3.17-17.50) as independent predictors of dengue, while smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 (OR 0.27, 95%CI 0.10-0.74).

ConclusionsAlthough prone to potential biases, these data suggest that non-severe dengue may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with higher dengue attack rates.

In this article, we present a mathematical SEIR model focused on analysing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, the patients circulating in the hospitals and evaluating the effects of health policies and vaccination on the control of the pandemic. We tested the model using registered cases and population data from the province of Granada (Spain), that represents a population size near 1 million citizens with low density of population and low prevalence. After calibrating the model with the data obtained from 15 March to 22 September 2020, we simulate different vaccination scenarios - including effectiveness and availability date - in order to study the possible evolution of the disease. The results show that: 1) infected will increase until 5.6\% - 7.4\% of the total population over next 3-4 months (2nd wave); 2) vaccination seems not to be enough to face the pandemic and other strategies should be used; 3) we also support the claim of the WHO about the effectiveness of the vaccine, that should be, at least, of 50\% to represent a substantial progress against the COVID-19; 4) after the 2nd wave, the return to normal life should be controlled and gradual to avoid a 3rd wave. The proposed study may be a useful tool for giving insight into the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and to design vaccination and health policies.",José M.

127,Mortality among Adults Ages 25-44 in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused a marked increase in all-cause deaths in the United States, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. Because younger adults have far lower infection fatality rates, less attention has been focused on the mortality burden of COVID-19 in this demographic.

MethodsWe performed an observational cohort study using public data from the National Center for Health Statistics at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and CDC Wonder. We analyzed all-cause mortality among adults ages 25-44 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Further, we compared COVID-19-related deaths in this age group during the pandemic period to all drug overdose deaths and opioid-specific overdose deaths in each of the ten Health and Human Services (HHS) regions during the corresponding period of 2018, the most recent year for which data are available.

ResultsAs of September 6, 2020, 74,027 all-cause deaths occurred among persons ages 25-44 years during the period from March 1st to July 31st, 2020, 14,155 more than during the same period of 2019, a 23% relative increase (incident rate ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.21-1.24), with a peak of 30% occurring in May (IRR 1.30; 95% CI 1.27-1.33). In HHS Region 2 (New York, New Jersey), HHS Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas), and HHS Region 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada), COVID-19 deaths exceeded 2018 unintentional opioid overdose deaths during at least one month. Combined, 2,450 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in these three regions during the pandemic period, compared to 2,445 opioid deaths during the same period of 2018.

MeaningWe find that COVID-19 has likely become the leading cause of death--surpassing unintentional overdoses--among young adults aged 25-44 in some areas of the United States during substantial COVID-19 outbreaks.

NoteThe data presented here have since been updated. As a result, an additional 1,902 all-cause deaths occurring among US adults ages 25-44 during the period of interest are not accounted for in this manuscript.",Jeremy S Faust; Harlan Krumholz; Katherine L Dickerson; Zhenqiu Lin; Cleavon Gilman; Rochelle P.

128,"Cost and social distancing dynamics in a mathematical model of COVID-19 with application to Ontario, Canada","A mathematical model of COVID-19 is presented where the decision to increase or decrease social distancing is modelled dynamically as a function of the measured active and total cases as well as the perceived cost of isolating. Along with the cost of isolation, we define a healthcare cost and a total cost. We explore these costs by adjusting parameters that could change with policy decisions. We observe that minimum costs are not always associated with increased spending and increased vigilance which is due to the desire for people to not distance and the fatigue they experience when they do. We demonstrate that an increased in the number of lock-downs, each of shorter duration can lead to minimal costs.

Data SourcesArticles published in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and WHO COVID-19 research database, CDC database, and Cochrane COVID-19 study register between 1st December 2019 to 10th July 2020.

Study SelectionObservational studies involving patients [&le;]21 years with PIMS-TS or MIS-C, that reported the clinico-laboratory features, intensive care needs, treatment, and outcome.

Data ExtractionThe search identified 422 citations and finally 18 studies with 833 participants were included and pooled estimate was calculated for parameters of interest utilising random effect model.

Data SynthesisThe median age was 9 (8-11) years. Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, conjunctival injection, and respiratory symptoms were common clinical features. Majority had positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test and only 1/3rd had RT-PCR positive. The commonest laboratory abnormalities were elevated CRP, D-dimer, procalcitonin, BNP, fibrinogen, ferritin, troponin, and IL-6; and lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia. The cardiovascular complications included shock (65%), myocardial dysfunction (61%), myocarditis (65%), and coronary artery abnormalities (39%). Three-fourth children required admission in PICU for mechanical ventilation (25%) and vasoactive drugs (61%). The common treatment provided was IVIG (82%), steroids (54%), antiplatelet drugs (64%), and anticoagulation (51%). The mortality was low (n=13).

130,"Predictors of PTSD, depression and anxiety in UK frontline health and social care workers during COVID-19.","ObjectivesThe objectives of this study were to identify demographic, work-related and other predictors for clinically significant psychological distress, including PTSD, depression, and/or anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK frontline health and social care workers (HSCWs), and to compare rates of PTSD, depression and anxiety across different groups of HCSWs.

DesignAn online survey was conducted in the weeks following the initial peak in cases (27 May - 23 July 2020).

SettingThe participants worked in a variety of healthcare roles UK hospitals, nursing or care homes and community settings.

ParticipantsA convenience sample (n=1194) of frontline UK health and social care workers completed the survey (including allied healthcare professionals, carers, clinical support staff, nurses and midwives, and other health and social care roles).

Main outcome measuresPTSD was assessed using the PTSD subscale of the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ); Depression assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); Anxiety was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7).

ResultsLogistic regression analyses examined predictors for depression, anxiety and PTSD separately, and also investigated the predictors of meeting the criteria for at least one of the three conditions. Over 57% of respondents met the threshold for clinically significant PTSD, anxiety or depression, and symptom levels were reasonably high and comparable across occupational groups. Participants who were more concerned about infecting others, who felt they could not talk with their managers, who reported feeling stigmatised due to their role and who had not had reliable access to personal protective equipment (PPE) were more likely to meet criteria for a clinically significant mental disorder. Being redeployed during the pandemic,and having had COVID were associated with a higher likelihood of meeting criteria for PTSD. Higher household income was associated with reduced odds for a mental disorder.

ConclusionsThis study identifies predictors of clinically significant distress during COVID-19 and highlights the need for reliable access to PPE. Further research should investigate mental disorders in under-represented HSCW groups and examine barriers to communication between managers and staff. Identifying risk factors for PTSD, depression and anxiety among HSCWs, and providing treatment for those who need it, is critical given that subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other healthcare crises are inevitable.",Talya Greene; Jasmine Harju-Seppanen; Mariam Adjeniji; Charlotte Steel; Nick Grey; Chris R Brewin; Michael A Bloomfield; Jo Billings,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216804,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216804,2020-10-25,2020-10-25,,True
131,Social and Psychiatric Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic and Distance Learning On High School Students: A Cross-Sectional Web-Based Survey Comparing Turkey and Denmark,"ObjectiveIn this study we investigated the socio-psychological effects of both the pandemic and distance learning on high school students in Turkey and Denmark. We aimed to assess whether there were any differences a) between students attending public or private schools in Turkey and b) between two countries having different approaches to pandemic and considerable socio-cultural and economic differences.

MethodsWe conducted a web-based questionnaire study in a cross-sectional design using Survey Monkey platform and sent out via social media to high school students from Turkey and Denmark. The survey collected socio-demographic data, several variables associated with pandemic and distance education and their effects on social life and psychological status. Additionally, emotional status was assessed using positive (PA) and negative affects (NA) schedule (PANAS). The survey ran from July 3 and August 31 2020.

ResultsWe studied 565 (mean age: 16.5 {+/-} 1.0) Turkish and 92 (mean age:17.7 {+/-} 1.0) Danish students, of whom the majority were female adolescents (63% vs 76%). Students educated in public (47.6%) and private high schools (52.4%) were nearly similar in number in Turkish group, whereas in the Danish sample almost all students were from public school (98.9%). Turkish students were significantly more likely to be compliant with the pandemic related restrictions. Besides that, there were significant socio-economic disparities between Turkish and Danish students and also within Turkey between public and private school students. Turkish online education system was significantly less adequate and satisfactory compared to the Danish system. These were even worse for those who were attending public schools in Turkey. Regardless of the socio-economic differences, the majority of the students in both countries has been negatively affected by the pandemic and related restrictions and had a negative opinion about distance education. This was also true for the PANAS scores. The total scores of PANAS were similar between Turkish and Danish students (PA: 27.0 {+/-} 7.6 versus 25.8 {+/-} 5.6; NA: 24.8{+/-} 7.5 versus 24.5{+/-} 7.3) and also within Turkey between public and private school students (PA: 26.8 {+/-} 7.5 versus 27.1 {+/-} 7.6; NA: 24.7{+/-} 7.2 versus 25.0{+/-} 7.8). While female students were significantly more severely affected in the Turkish group, no such gender differences were observed in the Danish group. Additionally, considerable portion of the students in Turkey and Denmark expressed loneliness (55.2% vs 59.8%, p<0.706), boredom (71.2% vs 58.7%, p=0.019) and anxiety towards the future (61.4% vs 22.8%, p<0.001). Decreased physical activity, sleep problems, eating disorders and domestic abuse were other complaints.

ConclusionsAdolescents from both countries have been severely affected by the pandemic and its related restrictions and expressed negative views about distance education. Turkish online education system seemed to be less satisfactory when compared to Danish system and within Turkey, public school students had significantly more disadvantages compared to those attending private schools. Despite the fact that there were several socio-economic inequalities among students, in general, there were no robust significant differences regarding psychological status and opinion about distance learning, indicating a global worsening of emotional status during pandemic.",Lara Selin Seyahi; Seyda Gul Ozcan; Necdet Sut; Ayumi Mayer; Burc Cagri Poyraz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20217406,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20217406,2020-10-25,2020-10-25,,True
132,Development of a predictive risk model for severe COVID-19 disease using population-based administrative data,"Background: Recent studies have reported numerous significant predictors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 disease. However, there have been few simple clinical risk score for prompt risk stratification. The objective is to develop a simple risk score for severe COVID-19 disease using territory-wide healthcare data based on simple clinical and laboratory variables. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to Hong Kong public hospitals between 1st January and 22nd August 2020 diagnosed with COVID-19, as confirmed by RT-PCR, were included. The primary outcome was composite intensive care unit admission, need for intubation or death with follow-up until 8th September 2020. Results: COVID-19 testing was performed in 237493 patients and 4445 patients (median age 44.8 years old, 95% CI: [28.9, 60.8]); 50% male) were tested positive. Of these, 212 patients (4.8%) met the primary outcome. A risk score including the following components was derived from Cox regression: gender, age, hypertension, stroke, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease/heart failure, respiratory disease, renal disease, increases in neutrophil count, monocyte count, sodium, potassium, urea, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, high sensitive troponin-I, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer and C-reactive protein, as well as decreases in lymphocyte count, base excess and bicarbonate levels. The model based on test results taken on the day of admission demonstrated an excellent predictive value. Incorporation of test results on successive time points did not further improve risk prediction.

133,"Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings for patients of different age groups with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a hospital in Saudi Arabia","BackgroundAlthough the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to rage worldwide, clinical and laboratory studies of this disease have been limited in many countries. We investigated the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory findings of COVID-19 infected patients to identify the effective indicators correlated with the disease.

MethodsA retrospective study was conducted at King Abdullah Hospital in Bisha Province, Saudi Arabia, from March 20 to June 30, 2020. Patients of different age groups were confirmed as having COVID-19 infection using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were statistically analyzed.

ResultsOf the 137 patients, 88 were male and 49 were female, with a mean age of 49.3 years (SD{+/-}18.4). The patients were elderly (n=29), adults (n=103), and children (n=5). Of these, 54 (39.4%) had comorbidities, 24% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12 (8.8%) died. On admission, the main clinical manifestations were fever (82.5%), cough (63.5%), shortness of breath (24.8%), chest pain (19.7%), and fatigue (18.2%).

In all patients, increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes were observed. Patients lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 46.7%, D-dimer in 41.6%, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 39.4% of patients. The elderly showed higher neutrophil (p=0.003) and lower lymphocyte (p=0.001) counts than adults and children. Glucose, creatine kinase-MB, LDH, bilirubin, D-dimer, and ESR were significantly higher in the elderly than in the adults. The COVID-19 death group had a higher leucocyte count (p = 0.043), and higher urea (p=0.025) and potassium (p=0.026) than the recovered group but had a lower hemoglobin concentration (p=0.018). A significant association was determined between COVID-19 death ({chi}2(1)=17.751, p<0.001), and the presence of cardiovascular disease ({chi}2(1)=17.049, p<0.001), hypertension ({chi}2(1)=7.659, p=0.006), renal failure ({chi}2(1)=4.172, p<0.04), old age (t(135) = 4.747, p <0.001), and ICU admission ({chi}2(1) = 17.751 (1), p<0.001).

Using disease parameters informed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigate the effects of various crucial mitigation features on the epidemic spreading: fraction of the infectious population that is identifiable through the tests; testing frequency; time delay between testing and isolation of positively tested individuals; and the further time delay until quarantining their contacts as well as the quarantine duration.

However, despite the mounting evidence about SARS-CoV-2 infecting the human gut, little is known about the antiviral programs triggered in this organ. To address this gap, we performed single-cell transcriptomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected intestinal organoids. We identified a subpopulation of enterocytes as the prime target of SARS-CoV-2 and, interestingly, found the lack of positive correlation between susceptibility to infection and the expression of ACE2. Infected cells activated strong proinflammatory programs and produced interferon, while expression of interferon-stimulated genes was limited to bystander cells due to SARS-CoV-2 suppressing the autocrine action of interferon. These findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 curtails the immune response and highlights the gut as a proinflammatory reservoir that should be considered to fully understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.",Sergio Triana; Camila Metz Zumaran; Carlos Ramirez; Carmon Kee; Patricio Doldan; Mohammed Shahraz; Daniel Schraivogel; Andreas R.

138,A cysteine protease inhibitor blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection of human and monkey cells,"K777 is a di-peptide analog that contains an electrophilic vinyl-sulfone moiety and is a potent, covalent inactivator of cathepsins. Vero E6, HeLa/ACE2, Caco-2, A549/ACE2, and Calu-3, cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and then treated with K777. K777 reduced viral infectivity with EC50 values of inhibition of viral infection of: 74 nM for Vero E6, <80 nM for A549/ACE2, and 4 nM for HeLa/ACE2 cells. In contrast, Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells had EC50 values in the low micromolar range. No toxicity of K777 was observed for any of the host cells at 10-100 M inhibitor. K777 did not inhibit activity of the papain-like cysteine protease and 3CL cysteine protease, encoded by SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of [&le;] 100 M. These results suggested that K777 exerts its potent anti-viral activity by inactivation of mammalian cysteine proteases which are essential to viral infectivity. Using a propargyl derivative of K777 as an activity-based probe, K777 selectively targeted cathepsin B and cathepsin L in Vero E6 cells. However only cathepsin L cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and K777 blocked this proteolysis. The site of spike protein cleavage by cathepsin L was in the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 , differing from the cleavage site observed in the SARS CoV-1 spike protein. These data support the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of K777 is mediated through inhibition of the activity of host cathepsin L and subsequent loss of viral spike protein processing.",Drake Mellott; Chien-Te Tseng; Aleksandra Drelich; Pavla Fajtova; Bala C Chenna; Demetrios Kostomiris; Jason C Hsu; Jiyun Zhu; Zane Taylor; Vivian Tat; Ardala Katzfuss; Linfeng Li; Miriam A Giardini; Danielle Skinner; Ken Hirata; Sungjun Beck; Aaron F Carlin; Alex E.

Nasal IVM spray (NIVM spray) administration may contribute to attaining high drug concentrations in nasopharyngeal (NP) tissue, a primary site of virus entrance/replication. The safety and pharmacokinetic performance of a new NIVM spray formulation in a piglet model were assessed. Crossbred piglets (10/12 kg) were treated with either one or two (12 h apart) doses of N IVM spray (2 mg, 1 puff/nostril) or orally (0.2 mg/kg). The overall safety of NIVM-spray was assessed (clinical, haematological, serum biochemical determinations), and histopathology evaluation of the application site tissues performed. The IVM concentration profiles measured in plasma and respiratory tract tissues (nasopharynx and lungs) after the nasal spray treatment (one and two applications) were compared with those achieved after the oral administration. Animals tolerated well the novel NIVM spray formulation. No local/systemic adverse events were observed. After nasal administration, the highest IVM concentrations were measured in NP and lung tissues. Significant increases in IVM concentration profiles in both NPtissue and lungs were observed after the 2 dose nasal administrations. The nasal/oral IVM concentration ratios in NP and lung tissues (at 6 h postdose) markedely increased by repeating the spray application. The fast attainment of high and persistent IVM concentrations in NP tissue is the main advantage of the nasal over the oral route.

In silico analysis of the complex between the virus mutated forms and ACE2 isoform 1 showed that out of 351 RBD point mutations, 83% destabilizes the complex, while 17% have mild stabilizing effect. Study of the complex SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain RBD region /ACE2 isoform 1, 6LZG PDB 3D model revealed 18 contact residues. Interestingly, mutations occurring in 15 out of these residues show variations in the patterns of polar and hydrophobic interactions as compared to the original complex. Similarly, comparison of the effect on the complex stability of different ACE2 variants showed that the pattern of molecular interactions and the virus-receptor complex stability varies also according to ACE2 polymorphism. This could explain the large inter-individual variation of disease susceptibility and/or severity. The observation of a high variability in the interactions patterns highlights the complexity of the molecular interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 receptor. We infer that it is important to consider both ACE2 genetic variants and SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations to assess the stability of the virus-receptor association and evaluate the infectivity of circulating SARS-CoV-2. These findings point toward the importance of individuals genetic typing of the circulating viral form as well as the ACE2 receptor. This will offer a good molecular ground to adjust the mitigation efforts for a better control of the virus spreading.",Dana Ashoor; Noureddine Ben Khalaf; Maryam Marzouq; Hamdi Jarjanazi; M.

141,"Evidence for ZAP-independent CpG reduction in SARS-CoV-2 genome, and pangolin coronavirus origin of 5'UTR","SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has an RNA genome, which is, overall, closely related to the bat coronavirus sequence RaTG13. However, the ACE2-binding domain of this virus is more similar to a coronavirus isolated from pangolin. In addition to this unique feature, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (and its closely related coronaviruses) has a low CpG content. This has been postulated to be signature of an evolutionary pressure exerted by the host antiviral protein ZAP. Here, we analyzed the sequences of a wide range of viruses using both alignment-based and alignment free approaches to investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our analyses revealed a high level of similarity between the 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2 and that of a Guangdong pangolin coronavirus. These data suggest that not only ACE2, but also the 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2 likely has a pangolin coronavirus origin. Additionally, we performed a detailed analysis of viral genome compositions as well as expression and RNA binding data of ZAP to show that the low CpG abundance in SARS-CoV-2 is not related to an evolutionary pressure from ZAP.",Ali Afrasiabi; Hamid Alinejad-Rokny; Nigel Lovell; Zhenming Xu; Diako Ebrahimi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.351353,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.351353,2020-10-24,2020-10-24,,False
142,Covid-19 in children: is there any correlation with renal function and severity of the disease?,"BackgroundKidney manifestations are life-threatening conditions, such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), especially when attributed to viral infections. The severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an emerging health problem worldwide, potentially affecting all organs, including the kidney. Most reports on kidney manifestations were conducted mostly on the adult and elderly population, and limited on children. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the correlation between kidney manifestations with the renal function of pediatric patients suffering from COVID-19.

MethodsAn observational analytic study was conducted in Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, from March to August 2020. The demographic data, clinical signs, laboratory results, and notable kidney function were analysed, while the disease was classified as severe and nonsevere based on its clinical appearance. The Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric was used to analyze the collected data. Results. In this study, 16 COVID-19 children were selected as the research subjects, the median eGFR value in the severe group was lower (49.59 ml / minute / 1.73m2) compared to the nonsevere (113 ml / minute / 1.73m2), however, not statistically significant (p = 0.521). Significant high CRP and low thrombocyte levels were found in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.05). Conclusion.

143,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Southern Region of New Zealand, 2020","BackgroundDuring New Zealands first outbreak in early 2020 the Southern Region had the highest per capita SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. PCR testing was initially limited by a narrow case definition and limited laboratory capacity, so cases may have been missed.

ObjectivesTo evaluate the Abbott(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assay, alongside spike-based assays, and to determine the frequency of antibodies among PCR-confirmed and probable cases, contacts, and higher risk individuals in the Southern Region of NZ.

Study designPre-pandemic sera (n=300) were used to establish assay specificity and sera from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=78) to establish sensitivity. For prevalence analysis, all samples (n=1214) were tested on the Abbott assay, and all PCR-confirmed cases (n=78), probable cases (n=9), and higher risk individuals with grey-zone (n=14) or positive results (n=11) were tested on four additional SARS-CoV-2 serological assays.

ResultsThe median time from infection onset to serum collection for PCR-confirmed cases was 14 weeks (range 11-17 weeks). The Abbott assay demonstrated a specificity of 99.7% (95% CI, 98.2%-99.99%) and a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI, 66.0%-85.7%). Spike-based assays demonstrated superior sensitivity ranging 89.7-94.9%. Nine previously undiagnosed sero-positive individuals were identified, and all had epidemiological risk factors.

ConclusionsSpike-based assays demonstrated higher sensitivity than the Abbott IgG assay, likely due to temporal differences in antibody persistence.

Extending the basic model of viral dynamics we propose here a formal approach to describe the neutralizing versus non-neutralizing scenarios and compare with the possible effects of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The theoretical model is consistent with data available from the literature and conclusions show that, while both non-neutralizing scenarios and ADE give rise to similar final virus clearance, the non-neutralizing antibodies can induce permanent high levels of antibody production with documented unfavorable impact on the disease progression and outcome.

The next generation matrix method was adopted to compute the basic reproduction number (R0) in order to assess the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 deadly disease. Stability analysis of the disease free equilibrium is investigated based on the basic reproduction number and the result shows that it is locally and asymptotically stable for R0 less than 1. Numerical calculation of the basic reproduction number revealed that R0 < 1 which means that the disease can be eradicated from Nigeria.

146,Early intervention is the key to success in COVID-19 control,"New Zealand responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with a combination of border restrictions and an Alert Level system that included strict stay-at-home orders. These interventions were successful in containing the outbreak and ultimately eliminating community transmission of COVID-19. The timing of interventions is crucial to their success. Delaying interventions for too long may both reduce their effectiveness and mean that they need to be maintained for a longer period of time. Here, we use a stochastic branching process model of COVID-19 transmission and control to simulate the epidemic trajectory in New Zealand and the effect of its interventions during its COVID-19 outbreak in March-April 2020. We use the model to calculate key outcomes, including the peak load on the contact tracing system, the total number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the probability of elimination within a specified time frame. We investigate the sensitivity of these outcomes to variations in the timing of the interventions. We find that a delay to the introduction of Alert Level 4 controls results in considerably worse outcomes. Changes in the timing of border measures have a smaller effect. We conclude that the rapid response in introducing stay-at-home orders was crucial in reducing the number of cases and deaths and increasing the probability of elimination.

Executive SummaryO_LIEvaluating the effectiveness of New Zealands COVID-19 response, relative to hypothetical response scenarios, is important for guiding future response strategies. We assess the importance of early implementation of interventions for controlling COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIWe model counterfactual (alternative  what-if) scenarios in which the timings of three policy interventions are varied: border restrictions requiring 14-day quarantine of all international arrivals, border closure except to returning residents and citizens, and Alert Level 4 restrictions.
C_LIO_LIKey measures describing the dynamics of a COVID-19 outbreak (notably peak load on the contact tracing system, the total number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the probability of elimination within a specified time frame), are used to compare outcomes from each scenario with New Zealands actual outcomes.
C_LIO_LIKey measures were more sensitive to the timing of Alert Level 4, than to timing of border restrictions and border closure. Of the three counterfactual scenarios, an earlier start to Alert Level 4 would have resulted in the greatest reduction in numbers of cases and deaths.
C_LIO_LIDelaying the start of Alert Level 4 by 20 days could have led to over 11,500 cases and 200 deaths, and would have substantially reduced the probability of eliminating community transmission of COVID-19, requring a longer period at Alert Level 4 to achieve control.

147,Supervised self-collected SARS-CoV-2 testing in indoor summer camps to inform school reopening,"Background and ObjectivesTesting strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in school settings are needed to assess the efficacy of infection mitigation strategies and inform school reopening policies. We hypothesized that supervised serial self-collected non-nasopharyngeal testing in summer camp settings would be acceptable and feasible.

MethodsWe performed a cohort study at two urban day camps for kindergarten-8th graders in June and July 2020. Eligible participants were campers, up to two adult household contacts, and camp staff. We assessed participation rates for providing, at two time points, supervised, self-collected anterior nares samples for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and saliva samples for antibody testing. We qualitatively assessed testing feasibility and adherence to stated camp infection mitigation strategies.

Results76% (186/246) of eligible participants consented. The cohort completing both rounds of testing (n=163) comprised 67 campers, 76 household contacts, and 20 staff. Among those present, 100% of campers and staff completed test collection at both time points. Testing was feasible to implement, including staff participation supervising camper test collection. No virus was detected by RT-PCR; seven participants had antibodies. Observed adherence to stated camp mitigation policies for masking, physical distancing, and stable cohorting was generally high.

ConclusionsSupervised, self-collected serial anterior nasal and saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 testing was acceptable, with successful repeated participation by children ages 5-14.

148,"Associations between Affect, Physical Activity, and Anxiety Among US Children During COVID-19","We investigated how emotional responses (positive and negative affect), physical activity (PA), and sedentary behaviors related to anxiety among US children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-four typically-developing children (63% girls) age 9-15 years old completed two virtual visits during height of ""stay-at-home"" measures between April 22 - July 29, 2020. Children completed 24-hour PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), and the shortened 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C). Children reported state anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Children with higher positive affect and who reported more time in PA reported less state anxiety. Sedentary and leisure screen time were positively correlated with negative affect. Our findings suggest that maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA, and limiting leisure screen time may be important for child mental health during stressful periods.

Statement of RelevanceThere is increasing concern regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the psychological and physical health of children. To date, studies on mental health during the pandemic in children are limited. We investigated links between activity levels and psychological outcomes in children during the height of the ""stay-at-home"" measures. We found that children had anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than normative values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic, and 94% of children exceeded the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on leisure screen time. Positive affect and physical activity were associated with reduced anxiety levels in children during the pandemic.

150,"Anti-vaccine attitudes and risk factors for not agreeing to vaccination against COVID-19 amongst 32,361 UK adults: Implications for public health communications","BackgroundNegative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults.

MethodsData were from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19.

Findings16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust or misinformation about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 22% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low income (< {pound}30,000 a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of vaccine benefit mistrust and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19.

InterpretationNegative attitudes towards vaccines are major public health concerns in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns.

O_TEXTBOXEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed for articles published in English from 1 January 2020 to 20 September 2020 with the following keywords: (""COVID19 vaccine"" OR ""coronavirus vaccine"") and (""intent*"" OR ""refusal""). Our search found 639 titles. Several previous studies have examined predictors of intent to vaccinate for COVID-19 when it becomes available. Reasons for unwillingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccination when it becomes available centred on concerns about its newness, safety, and potential side effects. However, estimates and predictors of negative vaccine attitudes in general and how these attitudes predict uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate in the context of COVID-19 are unavailable.

Added value of this studyThe attitudinal and behavioural barriers to being unsure about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and not intending to receive one were largely overlapping; 1) didnt get a flu vaccine last year, 2) poor adherence to government guidelines, 3) concerns about the unforeseen future effects of vaccines, and 4) and general mistrust in the benefits of vaccines.

Implications of all of the available evidenceMistrust towards vaccines represent a significant challenge in achieving the vaccination coverage required for population immunity. Taken together, there is evidence that groups most vulnerable to falling ill and dying of COVID-19 (e.g. those from ethnic minority backgrounds and who have lower incomes) have more negative attitudes towards vaccines and are less willing to vaccinate against COVID-19. Not everyone who intends to receive a COVID-19 vaccination will be able to do so because of practical barriers such as lack of accessibility and government decisions on the availability of the vaccine, underscoring the importance of improving vaccine attitudes in the general population to improve vaccine uptake amongst those who are offered a vaccine and prevent widening socio-economic health inequalities. Vaccine safety communication to increase public trust by the time a COVID-19 vaccine is available should begin now.

151,Mining transcriptomics and clinical data reveals ACE2 expression modulators and identifies cardiomyopathy as a risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cell-entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It plays critical roles in both the transmission and the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Comprehensive profiling of ACE2 expression patterns will help researchers to reveal risk factors of severe COVID-19 illness. While the expression of ACE2 in healthy human tissues has been well characterized, it is not known which diseases and drugs might modulate the ACE2 expression. In this study, we developed GENEVA (GENe Expression Variance Analysis), a semi-automated framework for exploring massive amounts of RNA-seq datasets. We applied GENEVA to 28,6650 publicly available RNA-seq samples to identify any previously studied experimental conditions that could directly or indirectly modulate ACE2 expression. We identified multiple drugs, genetic perturbations, and diseases that modulate the expression of ACE2, including cardiomyopathy, HNF1A overexpression, and drug treatments with RAD140 and Itraconazole. Our unbiased meta-analysis of seven datasets confirms ACE2 up-regulation in all cardiomyopathy categories. Using electronic health records data from 3936 COVID19 patients, we demonstrate that patients with pre-existing cardiomyopathy have an increased mortality risk than age-matched patients with other cardiovascular conditions.

This study was an observational cohort study to evaluate antibody responses in individuals with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, including 48 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a large tertiary care medical center. Serum samples were obtained from patients at various time points during the disease course and tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Medical records were reviewed, and antibody levels were compared with clinical and laboratory findings. Patients did not have high levels of antibodies within one week of symptoms, but most had detectable IgM and IgG antibodies between 8 and 29 days after onset of symptoms. Some individuals did not develop measurable levels of IgM or IgG antibodies. IgM antibodies were associated with elevated ALT, but there were no other significant associations. We did not observe significant associations of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with clinical outcomes, including intubation and death. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were unlikely to be detected in the first week of infection or in severely immunocompromised individuals.

155,Tocilizumab in nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia is often associated with hyperinflammation. Safety and efficacy of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab was evaluated in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.

MethodsNonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia were randomized (2:1) to tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous) or placebo plus standard care. Sites enrolling high-risk and minority populations were emphasized. The primary endpoint was cumulative proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28.

ResultsOf 389 randomized patients, 249 patients received tocilizumab and 128 received placebo in the modified intent-to-treat population (Hispanic/Latino, 56.0%; Black/African American, 14.9%; American Indian/Alaska Native, 12.7%; White, 12.7%; other/unknown, 3.7%). The cumulative proportion (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28 was 12.0% (8.52% to 16.86%) and 19.3 % (13.34% to 27.36%) for the tocilizumab and placebo arms, respectively (log-rank P=0.0360; hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97]). Median time to clinical failure up to Day 28 favored tocilizumab over placebo (hazard ratio 0.55 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.93]). All-cause mortality by Day 28 was 10.4% with tocilizumab and 8.6% with placebo (weighted difference, 2.0% [95% CI, - 5.2% to 7.8%). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 15.2% of tocilizumab patients (38/250 patients) and 19.7% of placebo patients (25/127).

156,"Early use of nitazoxanide in mild Covid-19 disease: randomized, placebo-controlled trial","The antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide is widely available and exerts broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro. However, there is no evidence of its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients who presented up to 3 days after onset of Covid-19 symptoms (dry cough, fever, and/or fatigue) were enrolled. After confirmation of SARS-CoV2 infection by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either nitazoxanide (500 mg) or placebo, TID, for 5 days. The primary outcome was complete resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were viral load, general laboratory tests, serum biomarkers of inflammation, and hospitalization rate. Adverse events were also assessed.

From June 8 to August 20, 2020, 1,575 patients were screened. Of these, 392 (198 placebo, 194 nitazoxanide) were analyzed. Median time from symptom onset to first dose of study drug was 5 (4-5) days. At the 5-day study visit, symptom resolution did not differ between the nitazoxanide and placebo arms. However, at the 1-week follow-up, 78% in the nitazoxanide arm and 57% in the placebo arm reported complete resolution of symptoms (p=0.048). Swabs collected were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in 29.9% of patients in the nitazoxanide arm versus 18.2% in the placebo arm (p=0.009). Viral load was also reduced after nitazoxanide compared to placebo (p=0.006). No serious adverse events were observed.

In patients with mild Covid-19, symptom resolution did not differ between the nitazoxanide and placebo groups after 5 days of therapy. However, early nitazoxanide therapy was safe and reduced viral load significantly.

Take home messageThis was the first study to evaluate the effect of early nitazoxanide therapy in mild Covid-19. Nitazoxanide did not accelerate symptom resolution after 5 days of therapy; however, reduced viral load significantly with no serious adverse events.",Patricia Rieken Macedo Rocco; Pedro Leme Silva; Fernanda Ferreira Cruz; Marco Antonio C.M.

157,Decrease in Hospitalizations for COVID-19 after Mask Mandates in 1083 U.S. Counties,"ImportancePopulation-wide facial masking decreases COVID-19 transmission but may also decrease the severity of disease by reducing the viral inoculum to which the wearer is exposed. The mortality of COVID-19 infection decreased in the U.S. in the second wave over the summer of 2020 compared to the first, but reasons for declining severity of disease have not been fully elucidated.

ObjectiveTo determine if facial mask mandates instituted in U.S. counties over the spring and summer of 2020 were associated with declining severity of infection as measured by the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19.

DesignData on hospitalizations due to COVID-19; testing access determined by number of tests performed per day per 100,000 people; new cases per day normalized by population; measures of population mobility to control for other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, social distancing, and business closures; age categories in each census tract; and dates of masking mandates in U.S. counties were all obtained from open-sourced epidemiologic datasets. We used a staggered difference-in-difference study design to assess the impact of the introduction of mask mandates (defined as the treatment) on the proportion of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 per week from March 10-September 16, 2020.

ExposureMask mandates

Main outcomeProportion of hospitalizations due to COVID-19

ResultsUsing data from 1083 counties (34% of U.S. counties, 82% of U.S. population) from 49 states, we found a statistically significant drop in hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 up to 12 weeks following county mask mandates of 7.13 (95% CI: -4.19, -10.1) percentage points, after controlling for age categories by county, testing access, numbers of cases, and population mobility.

Conclusion and RelevanceFacial masking may decrease COVID-19 severity by decreasing the viral inoculum to which individuals are exposed. Mask mandates across 1083 counties in the U.S. in 49 states decreased hospitalization rates from COVID-19 even when controlling for other factors that could impact disease severity, including age, testing access, number of cases, and mobility (as a proxy for other non-Pharmaceutical interventions such as sheltering-in-place). This study adds to the growing evidence for the impact of masking on disease severity and on the utility of population-wide facial masking for COVID-19 pandemic control.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre mask mandates with an increase in population-wide facial masking in the U.S. associated with decreased hospitalizations due to COVID-19?

FindingsWe hypothesize that facial masking, by reducing the viral inoculum to which the wearer is exposed, can lead to less severe disease if infection occurs. Using publicly-sourced epidemiological data, we assessed the change in proportion of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 as a result of the introduction mask mandates in 1083 counties across 49 states in the U.S. (representing 82% of the U.S. population). We found a statistically significant drop of up to 7.13 (95% CI: -4.19, -10.1) percentage points in COVID-19 hospitalizations following mask mandates, while controlling for age categories in the county, testing and cases normalized by population, and population mobility (as a way to control for other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as sheltering-in-place).

158,Serological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2: trends and humoral response in a cohort of public health workers,"BackgroundThere is considerable debate about the rate of antibody waning after SARS-CoV-2 infection, raising questions around long-term immunity following both natural infection and vaccination. We undertook prospective serosurveillance in a large cohort of healthy adults from the start of the epidemic in England.

MethodsThe serosurveillance cohort included office and laboratory-based staff and healthcare workers in 4 sites in England, who were tested monthly for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein IgG between 23rd March and 20th August 2020. Antibody levels from 21 days after a positive test were modelled using mixed effects regression models.

FindingsIn total, 2247 individuals were recruited and 2014 (90%) had 3-5 monthly antibody tests. Overall, 272 (12.1%) of individuals had at least one positive/equivocal spike protein IgG result, with the highest proportion in a hospital site (22%), 14% in London and 2.1% in a rural area. Results were similar for nucleoprotein IgG. Following a positive result, 39/587 (6.6%) tested negative for nucleoprotein IgG and 52/515 (10.1%) for spike protein IgG. Nucleoprotein IgG declined by 6.4% per week (95% CI, 5.5-7.4%; half-life, 75 [95% CI, 66-89] days) and spike protein IgG by 5.8% (95% CI, 5.1-6.6%; half-life, 83 [95% CI, 73-96] days).

ConclusionsOver the study period SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 8-10% overall and up to 21% in clinical healthcare workers. In seropositive individuals, nucleoprotein and spike protein IgG antibodies declined with time after infection and 50% are predicted to fall below the positive test threshold after 6 months.

159,Comparison of three nasopharyngeal swab types and the impact of physiochemical properties for optimal SARS-CoV-2 detection,"Adequate swab specimen collection, release and detection of nucleic acids by molecular diagnostic assays is largely attributed to the physical and chemical characteristics of different swab types. We investigated properties of three types of commercial nasopharyngeal swabs (nylon flocked: Type 1-Media Merge; Type 2-Kang Jian Medical Apparatus, China and Type 3-Wuxi NEST Biotechnology Co. Ltd, China) used in clinical diagnostics with the aim to establish if different swab designs and configurations had any effect on swab performance. Properties investigated included viral absorption, release, capture, extraction and recovery efficiency from each swab for the detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). All swab types (n=18) were inoculated with different amounts of SARS-CoV-2 live viral cultures (1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 copies/ml) and eluted in sterile phosphate buffer saline. RNA was extracted from all swab eluates using a fully automated system (BD MAX System) and cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. RNA stability was also investigated after dry storage of swabs at room temperature for 72 hours. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed in the absorption and release capabilities between Type 1 and 3 as well as between Type 2 and 3 swabs, however, no significant difference was observed between Type 1 and 2. Ct values and extraction efficiency amounts of SARS-CoV-2 varied amongst the swab types. We conclude that in order to facilitate accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, assessment of NP swab characteristics is of importance before implementation for specimen collection in the clinical setting.",Trish R Kahamba; Lara Noble; Lesley Scott; Wendy Stevens,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20206078,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20206078,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
160,Survey of Attitudes on Personal Protection Interventions Against COVID-19 Including MMR Vaccination and Future Anti-COVID Vaccines,"An electronic survey was conducted in October, 2020 among individuals primarily age 60 and older regarding their degree of confidence of deriving personal protection from 8 different anti-COVID interventions - social isolation, lockdowns, avoiding restaurants, taking MMR vaccine, wearing masks when indoors with others, avoiding hotels, avoiding commercial air travel, and using the first future specific anti-COVID vaccine. Responses were received from 135 persons from many different U.S. regions and 5 foreign countries. Respondents were generally individuals with very high levels of education and personal achievement. Results demonstrated wide diversity of responses regarding each of these interventions. None were strongly supported by a majority of respondents, but those receiving the largest proportions of strong support were social isolation (41%), wearing masks indoors (41%), and using the first anti-COVID vaccine (41%). MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination was viewed much more positively than negatively but had the highest proportion of individuals who felt they had insufficient data to formulate an opinion. The largest number of strong negative assessments were toward lockdowns (37%). We speculate that the wide variation in perception of possible benefits from the surveyed interventions, most of which have been widely practiced by or imposed upon millions of individuals, in this highly accomplished older population at increased personal risk from COVID-19 reflects the current absence of rigorous scientific proof of the efficacy of any these interventions, and the continuation of the epidemic despite the widespread utilization of most of them.",Joseph D.

161,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in two regions of Estonia (KoroSero-EST-1),"BackgroundIn Estonia, during the first wave of COVID-19 total number of cases confirmed by PCR was 13.3/10,000, similar in most regions, including capital Tallinn, but in the hotspot of Estonian epidemic, an island Saaremaa, the cumulative incidence was 166.1/10,000.

AimWe aimed to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in these two regions, symptoms associated with infection and factors associated with antibody concentrations.

MethodsParticipants were selected using stratified (formed by age decades) random sampling and recruited by general practitioners. IgG were determined from sera by four assays. Symptoms of acute respiratory illness associated with seropositivity were analyzed by multiple correspondence analysis, antibody concentrations by multiple linear regression.

ResultsTotal of 3608 individual were invited and 1960 recruited From May 8 to July 31, 2020. Seroprevalence was 1.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-2.5) and 6.3% (95% CI 5.0-7.9), infection fatality rate 0.1% (95% CI 0.0-0.2) and 1.3% (95% CI 0.4-2.1) in Tallinn and Saaremaa, respectively. Of seropositive subjects 19.2% (14/73) had acute respiratory illness. Fever, diarrhea and the absence of cough and runny nose were associated with seropositivity in individuals aged 50 or more years. IgG concentrations were higher if fever, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest pain or diarrhea was present, or hospitalization required.

ConclusionSimilarly to other European countries the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Estonia was low even in the hotspot region Saaremaa suggesting that majority of population is still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

162,Superspreading Events Without Superspreaders: Using High Attack Rate Events to Estimate N o forAirborne Transmission of COVID-19,"We study transmission of COVID-19 using five well-documented case studies - a Washington state church choir, a Korean call center, a Korean exercise class, and two different Chinese bus trips. In all cases the likely index patients were pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic, which is when infective patients are most likely to interact with large groups of people. An estimate of N0, the characteristic number of COVID-19 virions needed to induce infection in each case, is found using a simple physical model of airborne transmission. We find that the N0 values are similar for five COVID-19 superspreading cases ([~]300-2,000 viral copies) and of the same order as influenza A. Consistent with the recent results of Goyal et al, these results suggest that viral loads relevant to infection from presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals may fall into a narrow range, and that exceptionally high viral loads are not required to induce a superspreading event [1,2]. Rather, the accumulation of infective aerosols exhaled by a typical pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic patient in a confined, crowded space (amplified by poor ventilation, particularly activity like exercise or singing, or lack of masks) for exposure times as short as one hour are sufficient. We calculate that talking and breathing release [~]460N0 and [~]10N0 (quanta)/hour, respectively, providing a basis to estimate the risks of everyday activities. Finally, we provide a calculation which motivates the observation that fomites appear to account for a small percentage of total COVID-19 infection events.",MARA G. PRENTISS; Arthur Chu; Karl K.

163,Viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the predictive value of repeat testing,"SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics that report viral RNA concentrations can be used to determine a patients stage of infection, but this potential has not yet been realized due to a lack of prospective longitudinal data to calibrate such inferences. Here, we report the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals using quantitative PCR testing. On average, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals reached similar peak viral RNA concentrations (22.2 Ct, 95% credible interval [19.1, 25.1] vs. 22.4 Ct [20.2, 24.5]) within similar amounts of time (2.9 days [0.7, 4.7] vs. 3.0 days [1.3, 4.3]), but acute shedding lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.5 days [6.5, 14.0] vs. 6.7 days [3.2, 9.2]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR result reliably indicated whether viral RNA concentration was increasing, decreasing, or in a low-level persistent phase.

166,Prediction of the infection of COVID-19 in Bangladesh by classical SIR model,"The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) started from Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019. It is one of the leading public health challenges in the world because of high transmissibility. The first patient of COVID-19 was officially reported on March 8, 2020, in Bangladesh. Using the epidemiological data up to October 17, 2020, we try to estimate the infectious size. In this paper, we used Classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered), model. The epidemic has now spread to more than 216 countries around the world. The necessary reproduction number R0 of Bangladesh is 1.92. The primary data was collected from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard (BANGLADESH: CASE TREND). In our analysis, the statistical parameters specify the best import to provide the predicted result. We projected that the epidemic curve pulling down in Bangladesh will start from the first week of November (November 4, 2020) and may end in the last week of July (July 24, 2021). It is also estimated that the start of acceleration on May 24, 2020, in 53 days, and the start of steady growth on September 10, 2020, in 109 days. The start of the ending phase of the epidemic may appear in the first week of November 2020, and the epidemic is expected to be finished by the last week of July 2021.

167,Patterns of Multimorbidity and Risk of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection: an observational study in the U.K.,"BackgroundPre-existing comorbidities have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection but evidence is sparse on the importance and pattern of multimorbidity (2 or more conditions) and severity of infection indicated by hospitalisation or mortality. We aimed to use a multimorbidity index developed specifically for COVID-19 to investigate the association between multimorbidity and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsWe used data from the UK Biobank linked to laboratory confirmed test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality data from Public Health England between March 16 and July 26, 2020. By reviewing the current literature on COVID-19 we derived a multimorbidity index including: 1) angina; 2) asthma; 3) atrial fibrillation; 4) cancer; 5) chronic kidney disease; 6) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 7) diabetes mellitus; 8) heart failure; 9) hypertension; 10) myocardial infarction; 11) peripheral vascular disease; 12) stroke. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between multimorbidity and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (hospitalisation or death). Potential effect modifiers of the association were assessed: age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, body mass index, air pollution, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, cardiorespiratory fitness, high sensitivity C-reactive protein.

ResultsAmong 360,283 participants, the median age was 68 [range, 48-85] years, most were White (94.5%), and 1,706 had severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of multimorbidity was more than double in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (25%) compared to those without (11%), and clusters of several multimorbidities were more common in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common clusters with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were stroke with hypertension (79% of those with stroke had hypertension); diabetes and hypertension (72%); and chronic kidney disease and hypertension (68%). Multimorbidity was independently associated with a greater risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted odds ratio 1.91 [95% confidence interval 1.70, 2.15] compared to no multimorbidity). The risk remained consistent across potential effect modifiers, except for greater risk among men.

The Veneto region was one of the first areas of the country where the virus spread rapidly particularly in the LTCFs. As it became evident that LTCs were the epicenter of the pandemic, health authorities of the Vicenza province adopted a plan, which included an epidemiological investigation in a case study facility (CSF) and a retrospective analysis to estimate the impact of COVID-19 in terms of mortality. Combining retrospective data and a prospective cohort study in the CSF we provided a tentative estimate of the impact of COVID-19 on LTCFs. We found an age-gradient in all variables explored. An observed mortality higher 60% than 2019 was found in those LTCF reporting COVID-19 cases.

169,Trends in suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in a major German city,"BackgroundIt remains unclear whether the COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on suicide rates. Social distancing, economic insecurity and increasing prevalence rates of mental disorders may cause an increase in risk factors for suicide.

MethodsData on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations in suicide risk, data from 2020 were compared to data from 2010 to 2019.

OutcomesA total of 333 suicides were registered and 2,791,131 life years (LY) were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 42 suicides and 300,834 LY accounted for the year 2020.

In 2020, suicide rates (SR, suicides per 100,000 LY) were lower in periods with moderate (SR = 8.5, {chi}2 = 4.374, p = 0.037) or severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.0, {chi}2 = 3.999, p = 0.046) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 18.0). A comparison with preceding years showed that differences cannot be attributed to seasonal variations. No age- or gender differences were found.

InterpretationSR decreased during the COVID-19 restrictions; we expect SR to rise in the medium term. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is therefore urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalized.

170,Modelling the Anatomical Distribution of Neurological Events in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review,"BackgroundNeuropathology caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported across several studies. The characterisation of the spatial distribution of these pathology remains critical to assess long and short-term neurological sequelae of COVID-19. To this end, Mathematical models can be used to characterise the location and aetiologies underlying COVID-19-related neuropathology.

MethodWe performed a systematic review of the literature to quantify the locations of small neurological events identified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among COVID-19 patients. Neurological events were localised into the Desikan-Killiany grey and white matter atlases. A mathematical network diffusion model was then used to test whether the spatial distribution of neurological events could be explained via a linear spread through the structural connectome of the brain.

FindingsWe identified 35 articles consisting of 123 patients that assessed the spatial distribution of small neurological events among COVID-19 patients. Of these, 91 patients had grey matter changes, 95 patients had white matter changes and 72 patients had confirmed cerebral microbleeds. White matter events were observed within 14 of 42 white matter bundles from the IIT atlas. The highest proportions (26%) of events were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. The splenium and middle of the corpus callosum were affected in 14% and 9% of the cases respectively. Grey matter events were spatially distributed in the 41 brain regions within the Desikan-Killiany atlas. The highest proportions ([~]10%) of the events were observed in areas including the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices. Sub-cortical events were most frequently identified in the Pallidum. The application of a mathematical network diffusion model suggested that the spatial pattern of the small neurological events in COVID-19 can be modelled with a linear diffusion of spread from epicentres in the bilateral cerebellum and basal ganglia (Pearsons r=0.41, p<0.001, corrected).

InterpretationTo our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically characterise the spatial distribution of small neurological events in COVID-19 patients and test whether the spatial distribution of these events can be explained by a linear diffusion spread model. The location of neurological events is consistent with commonly identified neurological symptoms including alterations in conscious state among COVID-19 patients that require brain imaging. Given the prevalence and severity of these manifestations, clinicians should carefully monitor neurological symptoms within COVID-19 patients and their potential long-term sequelae.",Nicholas Parsons; Athanasia Outsikas; Annie Parish; Rebecca Clohesy; Nilam Thakkar; Fiore Fiore DAprano; Fidel Toomey; Shailesh Advani; Govinda Raj Poudel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20215640,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20215640,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True
171,COVID-19 AMONG PATIENTS WITH HEPATITIS B OR HEPATITIS C: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,"Background & aimsHepatic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are common among people infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence on COVID-19 patients with HBV or HCV co-infections.

MethodsWe searched multiple electronic databases and preprint servers from December 1, 2019 to August 9, 2020. Studies were included if they reported quantitative empirical data on COVID-19 patients with HBV or HCV co-infections. Descriptive analyses were reported and data were narratively synthesized. Quality assessments was completed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools.

ResultsOut of the 941 identified records, 28 studies were included. Of the eligible studies, 235 patients with COVID-19 were infected with HBV and 22 patients with HCV. Most patients were male and mean age was 49.8 and 62.8 in patients with HBV and HCV, respectively. Death proportion was 6% among COVID-19-HBV and 13% among COVID-19-HCV co-infected patients. Among COVID-19 patients, 34.1% and 76.2% reported at least one comorbidity besides HBV and HCV infections, mainly hypertension and diabetes mellites type 2. The most common COVID-19-related symptoms in both HBV and HCV groups were fever, cough and dyspnea. ICU admission was reported in 14.1% and 21.4% of individuals with HBV and HCV, respectively.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest a considerable risk of morbidity and mortality among COVID-19 patients with HBV and HCV. Careful assessment of hepatic manifestations upon admission of patients could help improve health outcomes among COVID-19 patients with HBV or HCV co-infections.

172,Nasopharyngeal aspirates vs. nasal swabs for the detection of respiratory pathogens: results of a rapid review protocol,"BackgroundNasal pathogen detection sensitivities are often as low as 70% despite advances in molecular diagnostics. It has been suggested that this is linked, in part, to the choice of sampling method.

MethodsA diagnostic test accuracy review for sensitivity, using recently developed Cochrane methods for conducting rapid reviews, and the PRISMA protocol was undertaken, with QUADAS-2 risk of bias assessments and meta-analysis of included studies. Sensitivities were calculated by a consensus standard of positivity by either method as the gold standard. Insufficient and/or inaccurate, cross sectional or anatomical site pooling methodologies were excluded.

ResultsOf 13 included studies, 8 had  high risk of bias, and 5 had  high applicability concerns. There were no statistical differences in pooled sensitivities between collection methods for 8 different viruses, and neither with use of PCR, Immunofluorescence nor culture. In a single study, Influenza H1N1 favoured nasopharyngeal swabs, with aspirates having 93.3% of the sensitivity of swabs (p>0.001). Similar equivocal sensitivities were noticed in detecting bacteria.

ConclusionsThe chain of sampling, from anatomical site to laboratory results, features different potential foci along which sensitivity may be lost. A sufficient body of evidence exists that use of a different sampling method will not yield more respiratory pathogens.

173,The wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric complications in Covid-19 patients within a multidisciplinary hospital context,"ObjectiveTo describe the spectrum of neurological and psychiatric complications in patients with Covid-19 seen in a multidisciplinary center over six months.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, observational study on all patients showing neurological or psychiatric symptoms in the context of Covid-19 seen in the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry of the APHP-Sorbonne University. We collected demographic data, medical and treatment history, comorbidities, symptoms, date of onset, and severity of Covid-19 infection, neurological and psychiatric symptoms, neurological and psychiatric examination data and, when available, results from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, brain magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging, 18-fluorodesoxyglucose-position emission computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT)), electroencephalography (EEG) and electroneuromyography (ENMG).

Results245 patients were included in the analysis. One-hundred fourteen patients (47%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 10 (4%) died. The most frequently reported neuropsychiatric symptoms were motor deficit (41%), cognitive disturbance (35%), impaired consciousness (26%), psychiatric disturbance (24%), headache (20%) and behavioral disturbance (18%). The most frequent syndromes diagnosed were encephalopathy (43%), critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (26%), isolated psychiatric disturbance (18%), and cerebrovascular disorders (16%). No patients showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in their CSF. Encephalopathy was associated with greater age and higher risk of death. Critical illness neuromyopathy was associated with an extended stay in the ICU.

174,mRNA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate CVnCoV induces high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies and mediates protection in rodents,"The devastating SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demands rapid vaccine development and large scale production to meet worldwide needs. mRNA vaccines have emerged as one of the most promising technologies to address this unprecedented challenge. Here, we show preclinical data for our clinical candidate CVnCoV, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated non-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the full length, pre-fusion stabilised SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. S translated from CVnCoV is cleaved, post-translationally modified, and presented on the cell surface, highlighting the ability of mRNA vaccines to mimic antigen presentation during viral infection. Immunisation with CVnCoV induced strong humoral responses with high titres of virus neutralizing antibodies in mice and hamsters and robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in mice. Most importantly, vaccination with CVnCoV fully protected hamster lungs from challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2. To gain insights in the risk of vaccine-enhanced disease, hamsters vaccinated with a suboptimal dose of CVnCoV leading to breakthrough viral replication were analysed for signs of vaccine-enhanced disease. No evidence of increased viral replication or exacerbated inflammation and damage to viral target organs was detectable, giving strong evidence for a favourable safety profile of CVnCoV. Overall, data presented here provide evidence that CVnCoV represents a potent and safe vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.",Susanne Rauch; Nicole Roth; Kim Schwendt; Mariola Fotin-Mleczek; Stefan O.

175,Sterilizing Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Mice by a Single-Shot and Modified Imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 Agonist-Adjuvanted Recombinant Spike Protein Vaccine,"The search for vaccines that protect from severe morbidity and mortality as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a race against the clock and the virus. Several vaccine candidates are currently being tested in the clinic. Inactivated virus and recombinant protein vaccines can be safe options but may require adjuvants to induce robust immune responses efficiently. In this work we describe the use of a novel amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ-PEG-CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol-poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile). This amphiphile is water soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration, likely through binding to albumin. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is used to induce a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after single vaccination with trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the BALB/c mouse model. Inclusion of amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG-CHOL in the SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccine formulation resulted in enhanced immune cell recruitment and activation in the draining lymph node. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL has a better safety profile compared to native soluble IMDQ as the former induces a more localized immune response upon local injection, preventing systemic inflammation. Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL adjuvanted vaccine induced enhanced ELISA and in vitro microneutralization titers, and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response. To correlate vaccine responses with control of virus replication in vivo, vaccinated mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus after being sensitized by intranasal adenovirus-mediated expression of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene. Animals vaccinated with trimeric recombinant spike protein vaccine without adjuvant had lung virus titers comparable to non-vaccinated control mice, whereas animals vaccinated with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL-adjuvanted vaccine controlled viral replication and infectious viruses could not be recovered from their lungs at day 4 post infection. In order to test whether IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could also be used to adjuvant vaccines currently licensed for use in humans, proof of concept was also provided by using the same IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant human quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus split vaccine, which resulted in enhanced hemagglutination inhibition titers and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 antibody response. Enhanced influenza vaccine responses correlated with better virus control when mice were given a lethal influenza virus challenge. Our results underscore the potential use of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL as an adjuvant to achieve protection after single immunization with recombinant protein and inactivated vaccines against respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.",Sonia Jangra; Jana De Vrieze; Angela Choi; Raveen Rathnasinghe; Gabriel Laghlali; Annemiek Uvyn; Simon Van Herck; Lutz Nuhn; Kim Deswarte; Zifu Zhong; Niek Sanders; Stefan Lienenklaus; Sunil David; Shirin Strohmeier; Fatima Amanat; Florian Krammer; Hamida Hammad; Bart N Lambrecht; Lynda Coughlan; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; Bruno G De Geest; Michael Schotsaert,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.344085,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.344085,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,False
176,Potential Achilles heels of SARS-CoV-2 displayed by the base order-dependent component of RNA folding energy,"The energetics of the folding of a single-stranded nucleic acid into a stem-loop structure depend on both the composition and order of its bases. Composition tends to reflect genome-wide evolutionary pressures. Order better reflects local pressures. Base order is likely to be conserved when encoding a function critical for survival. The base order-dependent component of the folding energy has shown that a highly conserved region in HIV-1 genomes associates with an RNA structure. This corresponds to a packaging signal that is specifically recognized by the nucleocapsid domain of the Gag polyprotein. Long viewed as a potential HIV-1 ""Achilles heel,"" the signal can be targeted by a recently described antiviral compound (NSC 260594) or by synthetic oligonucleotides. Thus, a conserved base-order-rich region of HIV-1 may facilitate therapeutic attack. Although SARS-CoV-2 differs in many respects from HIV-1, the same technology displays regions with a high base order-dependent folding energy component, which are also highly conserved. This indicates structural invariance (SI) sustained by natural selection. While the regions are often also protein-encoding (e.g. NSP3, ORF3a), we suggest that their nucleic acid level functions, such as the ribosomal frameshifting element (FSE) that facilitates differential expression of 1a and 1ab polyproteins, can be considered potential ""Achilles heels"" for SARS-CoV-2 that should be susceptible to therapies like those envisaged for AIDS. The region of the FSE scored well, but higher SI scores were obtained in other regions, including those encoding NSP13 and the nucleocapsid (N) protein.

SignificanceMutation rates of microbial pathogens are generally higher than those of their hosts. While a microbe spreading from host-to-host can ""assume"" that it will face a succession of broadly similar challenges, those hosts cannot likewise ""assume"" that new microbial invaders will remain as they were in previous hosts. Thus, immune defenses may be overwhelmed. The therapeutic challenges are (1) to locate a conserved, less-variable, part of a pathogens genome, (2) identify the corresponding function, and (3) devise its effective inhibition. While often assumed to associate with protein-encoding functions, studies of the AIDS virus genome have identified RNA structure itself as both functional and conserved, so signifying vulnerability. Application of this technology to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has revealed similar potential ""Achilles heels.""",Chiyu Zhang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.343673,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.343673,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,False

High resolution AFM reveals structurally intact infectious and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 upon low concentration of formaldehyde treatment. This protocol allows the preparation of intact inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles for safe use of samples out of level 3 laboratory, as revealed by combining AFM and plaque assays, to accelerate researches against the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, no ACE2 inhibitors have shown definite beneficiaries for COVID-19 patients, applying the presence of another receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here we show that ACE2 knockout dose not completely block virus entry, while TfR directly interacts with virus Spike protein to mediate virus entry and SARS-CoV-2 can infect mice with over-expressed humanized transferrin receptor (TfR) and without humanized ACE2. TfR-virus co-localization is found both on the membranes and in the cytoplasma, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transporting by TfR, the iron-transporting receptor shuttling between cell membranes and cytoplasma. Interfering TfR-Spike interaction blocks virus entry to exert significant anti-viral effects. Anti-TfR antibody (EC50 ~16.6 nM) shows promising anti-viral effects in mouse model.

179,Spike glycoprotein and host cell determinants of SARS-CoV-2 entry and cytopathic effects,"SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus, is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein trimer mediates virus entry into host cells and cytopathic effects. We studied the contribution of several S glycoprotein features to these functions, focusing on those that differ among related coronaviruses. Acquisition of the furin cleavage site by the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein decreased virus stability and infectivity, but greatly enhanced the ability to form lethal syncytia. Notably, the D614G change found in globally predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains restored infectivity, modestly enhanced responsiveness to the ACE2 receptor and susceptibility to neutralizing sera, and tightened association of the S1 subunit with the trimer. Apparently, two unique features of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, the furin cleavage site and D614G, have evolved to balance virus infectivity, stability, cytopathicity and antibody vulnerability. Although the endodomain (cytoplasmic tail) of the S2 subunit was not absolutely required for virus entry or syncytium formation, alteration of palmitoylated cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail decreased the efficiency of these processes. As proteolytic cleavage contributes to the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, we evaluated the ability of protease inhibitors to suppress S glycoprotein function. Matrix metalloprotease inhibitors suppressed S-mediated cell-cell fusion, but not virus entry. Synergy between inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases and TMPRSS2 suggests that both proteases can activate the S glycoprotein during the process of syncytium formation. These results provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein-host cell interactions that likely contribute to the transmission and pathogenicity of this pandemic agent.

IMPORTANCEThe development of an effective and durable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential for combating the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies elicited during virus infection or following vaccination. Knowledge of the spike glycoprotein evolution, function and interactions with host factors will help researchers to develop effective vaccine immunogens and treatments. Here we identify key features of the spike glycoprotein, including the furin cleavage site and the D614G natural mutation, that modulate viral cytopathic effects, infectivity and sensitivity to inhibition. We also identify two inhibitors of host metalloproteases that block S-mediated cell-cell fusion, which contributes to the destruction of the virus-infected cell.",Hanh T Nguyen; Shijian Zhang; Qian Wang; Saumya Anang; Jia Wang; Haitao Ding; John C.

180,SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein attenuates stress granule formation and alters gene expression via direct interaction with host mRNAs,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over one million deaths thus far. There is an urgent need for the development of specific viral therapeutics and a vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly expressed upon infection and is essential for viral replication, making it a promising target for both antiviral drug and vaccine development. Here, starting from a functional proteomics workflow, we initially catalogued the protein-protein interactions of 21 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in HEK293 cells, finding that the stress granule resident proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2 copurify with N with high specificity. We demonstrate that N protein expression in human cells sequesters G3BP1 and G3BP2 through its physical interaction with these proteins, attenuating stress granule (SG) formation. The ectopic expression of G3BP1 in N-expressing cells was sufficient to reverse this phenotype. Since N is an RNA-binding protein, we performed iCLIP-sequencing experiments in cells, with or without exposure to oxidative stress, to identify the host RNAs targeted by N. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 N protein binds directly to thousands of mRNAs under both conditions. Like the G3BPs stress granule proteins, N was found to predominantly bind its target mRNAs in their 3UTRs. RNA sequencing experiments indicated that expression of N results in wide-spread gene expression changes in both unstressed and oxidatively stressed cells. We suggest that N regulates host gene expression by both attenuating stress granules and binding directly to target mRNAs.",Syed Nabeel-Shah; Hyunmin Lee; Nujhat Ahmed; Edyta Marcon; Shaghayegh Farhangmehr; Shuye Pu; Giovanni L Burke; Kanwal Ashraf; Hong Wei; Guoqing Zhong; Hua Tang; Jianyi Yang; Benjamin Blencowe; Zhaolei Zhang; Jack F Greenblatt,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.342113,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.342113,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,False

182,Exposome changes in primary school children following the wide population non-pharmacological interventions implemented due to COVID-19 in Cyprus: a national survey,"BackgroundSchool closures were part of a series of non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) measures addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in Cyprus. We aimed to study changes in the environment, diet, behavior, personal hygiene, contacts, lifestyle choices and the degree of compliance to NPI measures by primary school children in Cyprus at school and at home for two periods, i.e., before lockdown and during the school re-opening using the methodological context of the human exposome.

MethodsDuring June 2020, an online survey questionnaire was forwarded to parents of primary school children through schools administrations, with questions about the childrens lifestyle/behaviours for two periods; school re-opening, following the population-wide lockdown (May 21-June 26, 2020), and the school period before lockdown (before March 2020). Descriptive statistics and exposome wide association analysis were implemented to agnostically assess associations of demographic, lifestyle and behavioral parameters with the degree of compliance to NPI measures.

FindingsA total of 1509 children from more than 180 primary schools (out of 330 schools) in Cyprus were included. Median number of contacts per day at home, school and other places during weekdays was lower (p<0.001) in the post-lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period (5 vs 12, 10 vs 29 and 6 vs 14, respectively). Vulnerable contacts with children also decreased from 2[1, 3] in the pre-lockdown to 1[0, 2] in the post-lockdown period (p<0.001). Differences in sugary and ready-made food consumption, physical activity, screen time, digital communication and hand hygiene were noted between the two periods. More than 72% of children complied with the NPI measures, with the exception of the decrease in number of vulnerable contact(s) indicator (48%). Eating meat more frequently post-lockdown and doing less physical activity during school break post-lockdown were positively associated with increased time spent at home post-lockdown. Furthermore, the odds of compliance, as indicated by the time spent at home post-lockdown were lower with days elapsing from school re-opening, living in smaller town and using antiseptic more frequently pre-lockdown.

InterpretationIn this national survey, children showed a high degree of compliance to most NPI measures for the community and primary school settings in Cyprus. The initial NPI measures may have affected the childrens exposome profile in the following months, by altering their diet, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle and hand hygiene habits.

FundingThe study was partially funded by the EXPOSOGAS project, H2020 under grant agreement #810995

Panel: Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published until September 30, 2020 using the search terms: COVID-19, children and lifestyle. Only six peer-reviewed, English-language studies were retrieved on the effect of COVID-19 measures on childrens lifestyle. The impact of non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) measures on childrens health during the pandemic period has been sporadically studied by focusing on a few risk factors at a time without using the exposomes methodological framework, which is defined as the comprehensive characterization of all environmental exposures during ones lifetime.

Added value of this studyA survey targeted all primary schools of Cyprus to comprehensively study the impact of the initial population-wide NPI measures (lockdown) (March 13-May 4) on the childrens exposome during the school re-opening period (May 21 - June 26). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study looking at the post-confinement (lockdown) exposome profile changes of children during schools re-opening, after the initial population-wide NPI measures of COVID-19 response. The comprehensive and agnostic description of the childrens exposome profile may help to comprehensively account for both known and possibly unknown effects of NPI measures on childrens health and for delineating the childrens degree of compliance to infection prevention and control protocols at school and at home.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis dataset could inform COVID-19 risk-based public health response strategies targeted for school settings.

183,"Emergency Response for Evaluating SARS-CoV-2 Immune Status, Seroprevalence and Convalescent Plasma in Argentina","We report the emergency development and application of a robust serologic test to evaluate acute and convalescent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina. The assays, COVIDAR IgG and IgM, which were produced and provided for free to health authorities, private and public health institutions and nursing homes, use a combination of a trimer stabilized spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in a single enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. Over half million tests have already been distributed to detect and quantify antibodies for multiple purposes, including assessment of immune responses in hospitalized patients and large seroprevalence studies in neighborhoods, slums and health care workers, which resulted in a powerful tool for asymptomatic detection and policy making in the country. Analysis of antibody levels and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in over one thousand patient samples provided insightful information about IgM and IgG seroconversion time and kinetics, and IgM waning profiles. At least 35% of patients showed seroconversion within 7 days, and 95% within 45 days of symptoms onset, with simultaneous or close sequential IgM and IgG detection. Longitudinal studies of asymptomatic cases showed a wide range of antibody responses with median levels below those observed in symptomatic patients. Regarding convalescent plasma applications, a protocol was standardized for the assessment of end point IgG antibody titers with COVIDAR with more than 500 plasma donors. The protocol showed a positive correlation with neutralizing antibody titers, and was used to assess antibody titers for clinical trials and therapies across the country. Here, we demonstrate the importance of providing a robust and specific serologic assay for generating new information about antibody kinetics in infected individuals and mitigation policies to cope with pandemic needs.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThe development of robust and specific serologic assays to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand the pandemic evolution and to stablish mitigation strategies. Here, we report the emergency development, production and application of a versatile ELISA test for detecting antibodies against the whole spike protein and its receptor binding domain. Over half million tests have been freely distributed in public and private health institutions of Argentina for evaluating immune responses, convalescent plasma programs and for large seroprevalence studies in neighborhoods and health care workers. We are still learning how and when to use serologic testing in different epidemiological settings. This program allowed us to produce large amount of high quality data on antibody levels in symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and generate relevant information about IgM and IgG seroconversion time and kinetics. We also present standardized protocols for antibody quantification as guidance for convalescent donor plasma selection in hospitals throughout the country for compassionate use and clinical trials. Here, we provide a framework for generating widely available tools, protocols and information of antibody responses for pandemic management.",Diego Ojeda; Maria Mora Gonzalez Lopez Ledesma; Horacio Palleres; Guadalupe Costa Navarro; Lautaro Sanchez; Beatriz Perazzi; Sergio Villordo; Diego Alvarez; - BioBanco Working Group; Marcela Echavarria; Kasopefoluwa Y.

184,The effect of COVID-19 on critical care research: A prospective longitudinal multinational survey,"ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for high-quality evidence in critical care, while also increasing the barriers to conducting the research needed to produce such evidence.

ObjectiveTo determine the effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on critical care clinical research.

DesignMonthly electronic survey (March - August 2020).

SettingAdult or pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) from any country participating in at least one research study before the COVID-19 pandemic.

ParticipantsWe recruited one researcher or research coordinator per center, identified via established research networks.

Intervention(s)None

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Primary: Suspending recruitment in clinical research; Secondary: impact of specific factors on research conduct (5-point scales from no effect to very large effect). We assessed the association between research continuity and month, presence of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and population (pediatric vs. adult ICU) using mixed-effects logistic regression.

Results126 centers (56% pediatric) from 23 countries participated. 95 (75%) of centers suspended recruitment in at least some studies and 37 (29%) suspended recruitment in all studies on at least one month. The proportion of centers reporting recruitment in all studies increased over time (OR per month 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5, p = 0.007), controlling for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and type of ICU (pediatric vs. other). The five factors most frequently identified as having a large or very large effect on clinical research were: local prioritization of COVID-19 specific research (68, 54%), infection control policies limiting access to patients with COVID-19 (61, 49%), infection control policies limiting access to the ICU (52, 41.6%), increased workload of clinical staff (38, 30%), and safety concerns of research staff (36, 29%).

Conclusions and RelevanceDecisions to pause or pursue clinical research varied across centers. Research activity increased over time, despite the presence of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Guiding principles to safely sustain research during this and future pandemic waves are urgently needed.

185,Simulation and prediction of further spread of COVID-19 in The Republic of Serbia by SEIRDS model of disease transmission,"As a response to the pandemic caused by SARSCov-2 virus, on 15 March, 2020, the Republic of Serbia introduced comprehensive anti-epidemic measures to curb COVID 19. After a slowdown in the epidemic, on 6 May, 2020, the regulatory authorities decided to relax the implemented measures. However, the epidemiological situation soon worsened again. As of 15 October, 2020, a total of 35,454 cases of SARSCov-2 infection have been reported in Serbia, including 770 deaths caused by COVID19. In order to better understand the epidemic dynamics and predict possible outcomes, we have developed a mathematical model SEIRDS (S-susceptible, E-exposed, I-infected, R-recovered, D-dead due to COVID19 infection, S-susceptible). When developing the model, we took into account the differences between different population strata, which can impact the disease dynamics and outcome. The model can be used to simulate various scenarios of the implemented intervention measures and calculate possible epidemic outcomes, including the necessary hospital capacities. Considering promising results regarding the development of a vaccine against COVID19, the model is enabled to simulate vaccination among different population strata. The findings from various simulation scenarios have shown that, with implementation of strict measures of contact reduction, it is possible to control COVID19 and reduce number of deaths. The findings also show that limiting effective contacts within the most susceptible population strata merits a special attention. However, the findings also show that the disease has a potential to remain in the population for a long time, likely with a seasonal pattern. If a vaccine, with efficacy equal or higher than 65%, becomes available it could help to significantly slow down or completely stop circulation of the virus in human population. The effects of vaccination depend primarily on: 1. Efficacy of available vaccine(s), 2. Prioritization of the population categories for vaccination, and 3. Overall vaccination coverage of the population, assuming that the vaccine(s) develop solid immunity in vaccinated individuals. With expected basic reproduction number of Ro=2.46 and vaccine efficacy of 68%, an 87%- coverage would be sufficient to stop the virus circulation.",Slavoljub Grozdan Stanojevic; Mirza Ponjavic; Slobodan Stanojevic; Aleksandar Stevanovic; Sonja Radojicic,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216986,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216986,2020-10-23,2020-10-23,,True

We applied a computational drug repositioning pipeline to SARS-CoV-2 differential gene expression signatures derived from publicly available data. We utilized three independent published studies to acquire or generate lists of differentially expressed genes between control and SARS-CoV-2-infected samples. Using a rank-based pattern matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic, the signatures were queried against drug profiles from Connectivity Map (CMap). We validated sixteen of our top predicted hits in live SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assays in either Calu-3 or 293T-ACE2 cells. Validation experiments in human cell lines showed that 11 of the 16 compounds tested to date (including clofazimine, haloperidol and others) had measurable antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.

187,The incubation period of COVID-19: A scoping review and meta-analysis to aid modelling and planning,"BackgroundAn accurate estimate of the distribution of the incubation period for COVID-19 is the foundational building block for modelling the spread of the SARS COV2 and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies on affected communities. Initial estimates were based on early infections, the aim of this study was to provide an updated estimate and meta-analysis of the incubation period distribution for COVID-19.

MethodsThe review was conducted according to the PRISMA Scoping Review guidelines. Five databases were searched; CINAHL, MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, ASSIA, and Global Index Medicus for studies published between 1 January 2020 - 27 July 2020.

ResultsA total of 1,084 articles were identified through the database searches and 1 article was identified through the reference screening of retrieved articles. After screening 64 articles were included. The studies combined had a sample of 45,151 people. The mean of the incubation periods was 6.71 days with 95% CIs ranging from 1 to 12.4 days. The median was 6 days and IQR ranging from 1.8 to 16.3. The resulting parameters for a Gamma Distribution modelling the incubation period were {Gamma}(,{lambda}) = {Gamma}(2.810,0.419) with mean,  = /{lambda}.

ConclusionGovernments are planning their strategies on a maximum incubation period of 14 days. While our results are limited to primarily Chinese research studies, the findings highlight the variability in the mean period and the potential for further incubation beyond 14 days. There is an ongoing need for detailed surveillance on the timing of self-isolation periods and related measures protecting communities as incubation periods may be longer.",Prakashini Banka; Catherine M Comiskey,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216143,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216143,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,True
188,Diagnostic utility of a Ferritin-to-Procalcitonin Ratio to differentiate patients with COVID-19 from those with Bacterial Pneumonia: A multicenter study,"ImportanceThere is a need to develop tools to differentiate COVID-19 from bacterial pneumonia at the time of clinical presentation before diagnostic testing is available.

ObjectiveTo determine if the Ferritin-to-Procalcitonin ratio (F/P) can be used to differentiate COVID-19 from bacterial pneumonia.

DesignThis case-control study compared patients with either COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia, admitted between March 1 and May 31, 2020. Patients with COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia co-infection were excluded.

SettingA multicenter study conducted at three hospitals that included UCHealth and Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in the United States, and Yichang Central Peoples Hospital in China.

ParticipantsA total of 242 cases with COVID-19 infection and 34 controls with bacterial pneumonia.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe F/P in patients with COVID-19 or with bacterial pneumonia were compared. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined the sensitivity and specificity of various cut-off F/P values for the diagnosis of COVID-19 versus bacterial pneumonia.

ResultsPatients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a lower mean age (57.11 vs 64.4 years, p=0.02) and a higher BMI (30.74 vs 27.15 kg/m2, p=0.02) compared to patients with bacterial pneumonia. Cases and controls had a similar proportion of women (47% vs 53%, p=0.5) and COVID-19 patients had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (32.6% vs 12%, p=0.01). The median F/P was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (4037.5) compared to the F/P in bacterial pneumonia (802, p<0.001). An F/P [&ge;] 877 used to diagnose COVID-19 resulted in a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 56%, with a positive predictive value of 93.2%, and a likelihood ratio of 1.92. In multivariable analyses, an F/P [&ge;] 877 was associated with greater odds of identifying a COVID-19 case (OR: 11.27, CI: 4-31.2, p<0.001).

Conclusions and RelevanceAn F/P [&ge;] 877 increases the likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia compared to bacterial pneumonia. Further research is needed to determine if obtaining ferritin and procalcitonin simultaneously at the time of clinical presentation has improved diagnostic value. Additional questions include whether an increased F/P and/or serial F/P associates with COVID-19 disease severity or outcomes.",Amal A. Gharamti; Fei Mei; Katherine C.

189,Population-based prevalence surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review,"Population-based prevalence surveys of COVID-19 contribute to establish the burden and epidemiology of infection, the role of asymptomatic and mild infections in transmission, and allow more precise decisions about reopen policies. We performed a systematic review to evaluate qualitative aspects of these studies, their reliability, and biases. The available data described 37 surveys from 19 countries, mostly from Europe and America and using antibody testing. They reached highly heterogeneous sample sizes and prevalence estimates. Disproportional prevalence was observed in minority communities. Important risk of bias was detected in four domains: sample size, data analysis with sufficient coverage, measurements in standard way, and response rate. The correspondence analysis showed few consistent patterns for high risk of bias. Intermediate risk of bias was related to American and European studies, blood samples and prevalence >1%. Low risk of bias was related to Asian studies, RT-PCR tests and prevalence <1%.

190,COVID-19's unfortunate events in schools: mitigating classroom clusters in the context of variable transmission,"Widespread school closures occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because closures are costly and damaging, many jurisdictions have since reopened schools with control measures in place. Early evidence indicated that schools were low risk and children were unlikely to be very infectious, but it is becoming clear that children and youth can acquire and transmit COVID-19 in school settings and that transmission clusters and outbreaks can be large. We describe the contrasting literature on school transmission, and argue that the apparent discrepancy can be reconciled by heterogeneity, or ""overdispersion"" in transmission, with many exposures yielding little to no risk of onward transmission, but some unfortunate exposures causing sizeable onward transmission. In addition, respiratory viral loads are as high in children and youth as in adults, pre- and asymptomatic transmission occur, and the possibility of aerosol transmission has been established. We use a stochastic individual-based model to find the implications of these combined observations for cluster sizes and control measures. We consider both individual and environment/activity contributions to the transmission rate, as both are known to contribute to variability in transmission. We find that even small heterogeneities in these contributions result in highly variable transmission cluster sizes in the classroom setting, with clusters ranging from 1 to 20 individuals in a class of 25. None of the mitigation protocols we modeled, initiated by a positive test in a symptomatic individual, are able to prevent large transmission clusters unless the transmission rate is low (in which case large clusters do not occur in any case). Among the measures we modeled, only rapid universal monitoring (for example by regular, onsite, pooled testing) accomplished this prevention. We suggest approaches and the rationale for mitigating these ""unfortunate events"", even if they are expected to be rare.",Paul Tupper; Caroline Colijn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216267,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216267,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,True
191,Prevalence of COVID-19 in Adolescents and Youth Compared with Older Adults in States Experiencing Surges,"PURPOSEThere has been considerable controversy regarding susceptibility of adolescents (10-19 years) and youth (15-24 years) to COVID-19. However, a number of studies have reported that adolescents are significantly less susceptible than older adults. Summer 2020 provided an opportunity to examine data on prevalence since after months of lockdowns, with the easing of restrictions, people were mingling, leading to surges in cases.

METHODSWe examined data from six U.S. states experiencing surges in the number of cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and two other measures, related to prevalence in adolescents and youth as compared to older adults. The two other measures were: (Percentage of cases observed in a given age group) / (percentage of cases expected based on population demographics); and percentage deviation, or [(% observed - % expected)/ % expected] x 100.

RESULTSPrevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and for youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p<.00001), as was percentage observed / percentage expected (p<.005). The percentage deviation was significantly greater in adolescents/youth than in older adults (p < 0.00001) when there was an excess of observed cases over what was expected, and significantly less when observed cases were fewer than expected (p< 0.00001).

CONCLUSIONSOur results are contrary to previous findings that adolescents are less susceptible than older adults. The findings have implications for school re-openings. The age groups 10-19 and 15-24 are students in middle school, high school, college, and the first two years of professional/graduate school.

ORF3a assemblies as homotetramers, which are stabilized by residue C133. A recent cryoEM structure of a homodimeric complex of ORF3a has been released. A lower-resolution cryoEM map of the tetramer suggests two dimers form it, arranged side by side. The dimers cryoEM structure revealed that each protomer contains three transmembrane helices arranged in a clockwise configuration forming a six helices transmembrane domain. This domains potential permeation pathway has six constrictions narrowing to about 1 [A] in radius, suggesting the structure solved is in a closed or inactivated state. At the cytosol end, the permeation pathway encounters a large and polar cavity formed by multiple beta strands from both protomers, which opens to the cytosolic milieu. We modeled the tetramer following the arrangement suggested by the low-resolution tetramer cryoEM map. Molecular dynamics simulations of the tetramer embedded in a membrane and solvated with 0.5 M of KCl were performed. Our simulations show the cytosolic cavity is quickly populated by both K+ and Cl-, yet with different dynamics. K+ ions moved relatively free inside the cavity without forming proper coordination sites. In contrast, Cl- ions enter the cavity, and three of them can become stably coordinated near the intracellular entrance of the potential permeation pathway by an inter-subunit network of positively charged amino acids. Consequently, the central cavitys electrostatic potential changed from being entirely positive at the beginning of the simulation to more electronegative at the end.",Valeria Marquez-Miranda; Maximiliano Rojas; Yorley Duarte; Ignacio Diaz-Franulic; Miguel Holmgren; Raul Cachau; Fernando Danilo Gonzalez-Nilo,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.349522,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.349522,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,False

We show that our vaccine candidate, GRAd- COV2, is highly immunogenic both in mice and macaques, eliciting both functional antibodies which neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a robust, Th1- dominated cellular response in the periphery and in the lung. We show here that the pre-fusion stabilized Spike antigen is superior to the wild type in inducing ACE2-interfering, SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies. To face the unprecedented need for vaccine manufacturing at massive scale, different GRAd genome deletions were compared to select the vector backbone showing the highest productivity in stirred tank bioreactors.

195,Distinct Phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 Isolates Reveal Viral Traits Critical for Replication in Primary Human Respiratory Cells,"Since entering the human population, SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) has spread across the world, causing >40 million infections and >1 million deaths. While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether these changes impact adaptation, replication or transmission of the virus in its new host. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all the major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, viral stocks and passaging experiments, with kinetic virus replication data from non-human Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 sequence features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally-occurring substitutions in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G substitution generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E, and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin-cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human respiratory cells.

196,Broad transcriptional dysregulation of brain and choroid plexus cell types with COVID-19,"Though SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly appreciated that patients may suffer neurological symptoms of varied severity1-3. However, an unbiased understanding of the molecular processes across brain cell types that could contribute to these symptoms in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient. We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis. Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons--evolutionarily expanded in humans4--show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission. These perturbations are not observed in terminal influenza.

197,Small-Molecule In Vitro Inhibitors of the Coronavirus Spike - ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction as Blockers of Viral Attachment and Entry for SARS-CoV-2,"Inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2, which acts as a ligand-receptor pair that initiates the viral attachment and cellular entry of this coronavirus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are of considerable interest as potential antiviral agents. While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable / less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound-library that is focused on the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel drug-like compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50s of 0.2-3.0 M); whereas, control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not ACE2. Selected promising compounds inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells in concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50s (6-30 M). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for coronavirus attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.",Damir Bojadzic; Oscar Alcazar; Jinshui Chen; Peter Buchwald,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.351056,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.351056,2020-10-22,2020-10-22,,False
198,Deep learning segmentation model for automated detection of the opacity regions in the chest X-rays of the Covid-19 positive patients and the application for disease severity,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe pandemic of Covid-19 has caused tremendous losses to lives and economy in the entire world. Up until October 2020, it has caused more than 38 million infections and 1.1 million deaths. This has created a severe burden for the health care system worldwide. The machine learning models have been applied to the radiological images of the Covid-19 positive patients for disease prediction and severity assessment. However, a segmentation model for detecting the opacity regions like haziness, ground-glass opacity and lung consolidation from the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays is still lacking. The recently published dataset of a collection of radiological images for a rural population in United States had made development of such a model a possibility due to the high quality of the radiological images and the consistency in clinical measurements. We manually annotated 221 chest X-ray images with lung fields and opacity regions and trained a segmentation model for the opacity region. The model has a good performance in regarding the overlap between predicted and manually labelled opacity regions for both the testing data set and the validation dataset from very different sources. In addition, the percentage of the opacity region over the area of the total lung fields shows a good predictive power for the patient severity. In view of the above, our model is a successful first try in developing a segmentation model for the opacity regions for the Covid-19 positive chest X-rays. However, careful manual examinations of the model predictions by experienced radiologists show mistakenly predicted opacity regions caused probably by the anatomical complexities. Thus, additional work is needed before a robust and accurate model can be developed for the ultimate goal of implementation in the clinical setting.

199,Early prognostication of COVID-19 to guide hospitalisation versus outpatient monitoring using a point-of-test risk prediction score,"IntroductionRisk factors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 are defined but stratification of mortality using non-laboratory measured scores, particularly at the time of pre-hospital SARS-CoV-2 testing, is lacking.

MethodsMultivariate regression with bootstrapping was used to identify independent mortality predictors in a derivation cohort of COVID-19 patients. Predictions were externally validated in a large random sample of the ISARIC cohort (N=14,231) and a smaller cohort from Aintree (N=290).

Results983 patients (median age 70, IQR 53-83; in-hospital mortality 29.9%) were recruited over an 11-week study period. Through sequential modelling, a 5-predictor score termed SOARS (SpO2, Obesity, Age, Respiratory rate, Stroke history) was developed to correlate COVID-19 severity across low, moderate and high strata of mortality risk. The score discriminated well for in-hospital death, with area under the receiver operating characteristic values of 0.82, 0.80 and 0.74 in the derivation, Aintree and ISARIC validation cohorts respectively. Its predictive accuracy (calibration) in both external cohorts was consistently higher in patients with milder disease (SOARS 0-1), the same individuals who could be identified for safe outpatient monitoring. Prediction of a non-fatal outcome in this group was accompanied by high score sensitivity (99.2%) and negative predictive value (95.9%).

ConclusionThe SOARS score uses constitutive and readily assessed individual characteristics to predict the risk of COVID-19 death. Deployment of the score could potentially inform clinical triage in pre-admission settings where expedient and reliable decision-making is key.

200,The Causal Effect of Air Pollution on COVID-19 Transmission: Evidence from China,"There is increasing concern that ambient air pollution could exacerbate COVID-19 transmission. However, estimating the relationship is challenging because it requires one to account for epidemiological characteristics, to isolate the impact of air pollution from potential confounders, and to capture the dynamic impact. We propose a new econometric framework to address these challenges: we rely on the epidemiological Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model to construct the outcome of interest, the Instrument Variable (IV) model to estimate the causal relationship, and the Flexible-Distributed-Lag (FDL) model to understand the dynamics. Using data covering all prefectural Chinese cities, we find that a 10-point (14.3%) increase in the Air Quality Index would lead to a 2.80 percentage point increase in the daily COVID-19 growth rate with 2 to 13 days of delay (0.14 [~] 0.22 increase in the reproduction number: R0).

201,Prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthy blood donors in New York,"Despite the high level of morbidity and mortality worldwide, there is increasing evidence for asymptomatic carriers of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed blood specimens from 1,559 healthy blood donors, collected in the greater New York metropolitan area between the months of March and July 2020 for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using our proprietary technology, SERA (Serum Epitope Repertoire Analysis), we observed a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rates over the four-month period, from 0% [95% CI: 0 - 1.5%] (March) to 11.6% [6.0 - 21.2%] (July). Follow-up ELISA tests using S1 and nucleocapsid viral proteins confirmed most of these results. Our findings are consistent with seroprevalence studies within the region and with reports that SARS-COV-2 infections can be asymptomatic or cause only mild symptoms.

IMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused vast morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet several studies indicate that there may be a significant number of infected people who are asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms. In this study, samples were collected from healthy blood donors in a region of rapidly increasing disease burden (New York metropolitan area) and we hypothesized that a subset would be seropositive to SARS-CoV-2.

DBS are used by NHS for diagnosing HCV and by PHE for large scale HIV and Hepatitis C serosurveillance; the applicability of DBS based approaches to SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is uncertain.

ObjectiveTo compare antibody detection in dried blood spot eluates using the Roche Elecsys (R) immunoassay (index test) with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay (reference test).

SettingOne Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England.

Participants195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME.

Outcome MeasuresSensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population.

Results18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using a cut-off of ten median absolute deviations above the immunoassay result with negative samples, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma.

ConclusionDBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to immunoassays on plasma. Sample quality impacts on assay performance.

Furthermore, the VRD sensitivity for different Ct-value groups (Ct <20; Ct 20-25, Ct 25-30 and Ct [&ge;]30) and different intervals since symptom onset (< 7 days; [&ge;] 7 days) were examined.

DesignProspective performance evaluation study.

SettingMunicipal Health Service (GGD) COVID-19 test centres in West-Brabant, the Netherlands

ParticipantsIn order to evaluate clinical specificity, 352 symptomatic adults ([&ge;]18 years) who presented at a participating GGD test centre for a COVID-19 test between September 28 and October 7 2020 were included. In order to evaluate clinical sensitivity, 123 symptomatic adults ([&ge;]18 years) who were tested positive with qRT-PCR in a participating GGD test centre between September 26 and October 6 were included.

ResultsAn overall clinical specificity of 100% (95%CI: 98.9%-100%) and sensitivity of 80.7% (95% CI: 73,2%-86,9%) was found for the VRD compared to qRT-PCR. Sensitivity was the highest for low Ct-value categories and for specimen obtained within the first days after disease onset. For specimen obtained within 7 days after onset of symptoms, the overall sensitivity was 91.0% (95% CI: 82,4%-96,3%) and 98,6% (95% CI: 92,3%-100%) for samples with qRT-PCR Ct-value beneath 30.

ConclusionThe VRD is a promising diagnostic test for COVID-19 community screening for symptomatic individuals within 7 days after symptom onset in function of disease control. The clinical sensitivity was highest when viral load was high, which correlated with the duration of symptoms.

The most important aspect of saliva sampling approach is the convenience of obtaining material by self-sampling that is even possible at home.

In our experiments, saliva was sufficiently stable for testing for at least 24 hours after collection.

The results obtained from the saliva of a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient were consistent with those obtained from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from the same patient with the sensitivity 90% and specificity 100% during the first two weeks after the onset of symptoms.

To demonstrate the usefulness of testing saliva material for mass screening, crowd sampling with pooling was performed on 3660 people in 3-day time (44 samples were tested positive).

208,City-level SARS-CoV-2 sewage surveillance,"The COVID-19 pandemic created a global crisis impacting not only healthcare systems, but also world economies and society. Recent data have indicated that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is common, and that viral RNA can be detected in wastewater. This suggests that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for both epidemiological surveillance, and early warning for SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the population level. In this study we sampled an urban wastewater infrastructure in the city of Ashkelon, Israel, during the end of the first COVID-19 wave in May 2020 when the number of infections seemed to be waning. We were able to show varying presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater from several locations in the city during two sampling periods. This was expressed as a new index, Normalized Viral Load (NVL), which can be used in different area scales to define levels of virus activity such as red (high) or green (no), and to follow morbidity in the population at tested area. Our index showed the rise in viral load between the two sampling periods (one week apart) and indicated an increase in morbidity that was evident a month later in the population. Thus, this methodology may provide an early indication for SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak in a population before an outbreak is clinically apparent.

209,On nonlinear incidence rate of Covid-19,"Classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed model with constant transmission rate and removal rate may not capture real world dynamics of epidemic due to complex influence of multiple external factors on the spread. On top of that transmission rate may vary widely in a large region due to non-stationarity of spatial features which poses difficulty in creating a global model. We modified discrete global Susceptible-Infected-Removed model by using time varying transmission rate, recovery rate and multiple spatially local models. No specific functional form of transmission rate has been assumed. We have derived the criteria for disease-free equilibrium within a specific time period. A single Convolutional LSTM model is created and trained to map multiple spatiotemporal features to transmission rate. The model achieved 8.39% mean absolute percent error in terms of cumulative infection cases in each locality in a 10-day prediction period. Local interpretations of the model using perturbation method reveals local influence of different features on transmission rate which in turn is used to generate a set of generalized global interpretations. A what-if scenario with modified recovery rate illustrates rapid dampening of the spread when forecasted with the trained model.

210,Modifiable lifestyle factors and severe COVID-19 risk: Evidence from Mendelian randomization analysis,"BackgroundLifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be related to increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, little is known about whether these relationships are causal, or the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption and physical activity.

MethodsGenome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were selected as instrumental variables. GWAS summary statistics of these genetic variants for relevant lifestyle factors and severe illness of COVID-19 were obtained. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted.

ResultsBoth genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about 2-fold increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P<0.05). Genetically predicted physical activity was associated with about 5-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4, 20.3; P=0.02) decreased risk of severe respiratory COVID-19, but not with COVID-19 hospitalization, though the majority of the 95% CI did not include one. No evidence of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption, but associations were found when using pleiotropy robust methods.

211,"What predicts adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines? Longitudinal analyses of 51,000 UK adults.","In the absence of a vaccine, governments have focused on social distancing, self-isolation, and increased hygiene procedures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete, and existing studies provide limited understanding of what factors influence compliance; in particular modifiable factors. We use weekly panel data from 51,000 adults across the first three months of lockdown in the UK to identify factors that are related to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. We find evidence that increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic is longitudinally related to higher compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness are related to changes in compliance.

We tested health workers form a public laboratory to evaluate previous exposure to the virus and estimate the prevalence of antibodies against-SARS-CoV-2 in Adolfo Lutz Institute, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

MethodsThis study was an open, prospective evaluation among professionals of Adolfo Lutz Institute some administrative personnel from the Secretary of Health that shares common areas with the institute. We used a lateral flow immunoassay (rapid test) to detect IgG and IgM for SARS-CoV-2; positive samples were further evaluated using Roche Electrochemiluminescence assay. SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was also offered to participants.

ResultsA total of 406 HPs participated. Thirty five (8.6%) tested positive on rapid test and 32 these rapid test seropositive cases were confirmed by ECLIA. 43 HPs had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected at a median of 33 days, and the three cases not reactive at Roche ECLIA had a previous positive RNA. Outsourced professionals (34% seropositive), males (15%) workers referring COVID-19 patients at home (22%) and those living farther form the institute tended to have higher prevalence of seropositivity, but in multivariable logistic analysis only outsourced workers and those with COVID patients at home remained independently associated to seropositivity. We observed no relation of seropositivity to COVID samples handling. Presence of at least one symptom was common but some clinical manifestations as anosmia/dysgeusia. Fatigue, cough and fever were associated to seropositivity.

ConclusionsWe documented a relatively high (8.6%) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological reactivity in this population, higher among outsourced workers and those residing with COVID-19 patients. COVID related work did not increased seropositivity. Some symptoms show strong association to COVID-19 serology and may be used in scoring tools for screening or diagnosis in resort limited settings.",Valeria Oliveira Silva; Elaine Lopes de Oliveira; Marcia Jorge Castejon; Rosemeire Yamashiro; Cintia Mayumi Ahagon; Giselle Ibette Lopez-Lopes; Edilene Peres Real da Silveira; Marisa Ailin Hong; Maria do Carmo Timenetsky; Carmem aparecida de Freitas Oliveira; Luis Fernando de Macedo Brigido,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20213421,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20213421,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
213,Analytical solution of equivalent SEIR and agent-based model of COVID-19; showing the bounds of contact tracing,"Mathematical models not only forecast the possible future but also is used to find hidden parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerical estimates can inform us of both goals. Still, the interdependencies of parameters stay obscure. Many numerical solutions have been proposed so far; however, the analytical relationship between the outbreak growth, decay and equilibrium are much less studied. In this study, we have employed both an equivalent agent-based model and a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)-like model to prove that the growth rate can be determined analytically in terms of other model parameters, including contact tracing rate. We identify the most sensitive parameters as undocumented transmission rate and documentation ratio. Unfortunately, these are the parameters we have the least knowledge. We derived an identity that predicts the effectiveness of contact tracing in a country from observable parameters. We underline an unavoidable dilemma: that even in the case of high contact tracing, we cannot bring the outbreak to stalemate without applying substantial quarantine; however, some countries are benefiting from contact tracing. Besides, we have shown that the seemingly same parameters of the SEIR models and agent-based models are not equivalent. We propose a correction to bridge both models.",Huseyin Tunc; Fatma Zehra Sari; Busra Darendeli; Ramin Nashebi; Murat Sari; Seyfullah Enes Kotil,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20212522,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20212522,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
214,Changes of evening exposure to electronic devices during the COVID-19 lockdown affect the time course of sleep disturbances,"Study ObjectivesDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a worldwide increase in electronic devices daily usage. The exposure to backlit screens before falling asleep leads to negative consequences on sleep health through its influence on the circadian system. We investigated the relationship between the changes in evening screen exposure and the time course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period due to COVID-19.

Methods2123 Italians were longitudinally tested during the third and the seventh week of lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. During the second assessment, respondents reported the changes in the backlit screen exposure in the two hours before falling asleep.

ResultsParticipants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, higher sleep onset latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and clinical insomniacs increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and clinical insomniacs decreased. Respondents preserving their screen time habits did not show any change in the sleep parameters.

ConclusionsOur investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between the modifications of the evening electronic device usage and the time course of sleep disturbances during the lockdown period. Interventions to raise public awareness about the risks of excessive exposure to backlit screens are necessary to prevent sleep disturbances and foster well-being during the home confinement due to COVID-19.

Statement of SignificanceThe present investigation is the first to provide insights about the relationship between the changes in evening electronic device usage and the time course of sleep disturbances during the COVID-19 lockdown. Consistent with the well-known negative effect of backlit screen lights on circadian physiology, we demonstrated a strong relationship between the screen time modifications in the hours before falling asleep, the development and exacerbation of sleep disturbances, and the changes of sleep/wake patterns during the period of home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic. To date, hundreds of thousands of people are subjected to restraining measures worldwide. Our findings have large scale and broad-spectrum implications, considering the unavoidable increase of electronic device usage during the current period of limited social interactions.",Federico Salfi; Giulia Amicucci; Domenico Corigliano; Aurora D'Atri; Lorenzo Viselli; Daniela Tempesta; Michele Ferrara,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215756,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215756,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
215,Could nutrition modulate COVID-19 susceptibility and severity of disease? A systematic review,"BackgroundMany nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease and survival. The pandemic has fostered many nutrition-related theories, sometimes backed by a biased interpretation of evidence.

ObjectivesTo provide a systematic review of the latest evidence on how malnutrition across all its forms (under- and over-nutrition and micronutrient status) may influence both susceptibility to, and progression and severity of, COVID-19.

MethodsWe synthesised information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anaemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; poly-unsaturated fatty acids; iron; selenium; zinc; anti-oxidants, and nutritional support. For each section we provide: a) a landscape review of pertinent material; b) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a systematic search of a wide range of pre-print servers; and c) a screen of six clinical trial registries. Two reviewers were assigned per section for data extraction. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest. Searches took place between 16th May and 11th August, 2020. PROSPERO registration CRD42020186194.

ResultsAcross the 13 searches, a total of 2732 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, 4164 articles from the pre-print servers, and 433 trials were returned. A total of 288 published articles and 278 pre-print articles were taken to full text screening. In the final narrative synthesis, we cover 22 published articles, 39 pre-print articles and 79 trials. The review highlights a range of mechanistic and observational evidence to highlight the role nutrition can play in susceptibility and progression of COVID-19. However, to date, there is limited evidence that high-dose supplements of micronutrients will either prevent severe disease or speed up recovery, although results of clinical trials are eagerly awaited.

ConclusionsTo date there is no conclusive evidence supporting adoption of novel nutritional therapies. However, given the known impacts of all forms of malnutrition on the immune system, public health strategies to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition remain of critical importance. There is strong evidence that prevention of obesity, and its consequent type-2 diabetes, will reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes.",Not available,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20214395,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20214395,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
216,An agent-based model of spread of a pandemic with validation using COVID-19 data from New York State,"We introduce a simple agent based model where each agent carries an effective viral load that captures the instantaneous state of infection of the agent and simulate the spread of a pandemic and subsequently validate it by using publicly available COVID-19 data. Our simulation tracks the temporal evolution of a virtual city or community of agents in terms of contracting infection, recovering asymptomatically, or getting hospitalized. The virtual community is divided into family groups with 2-6 individuals in each group. Agents interact with other agents in virtual public places like at grocery stores, on public transportation and in offices. We initially seed the virtual community with a very small number of infected individuals and then monitor the disease spread and hospitalization over a period of fifty days, which is a typical time-frame for the initial spread of a pandemic. An uninfected or asymptomatic agent is randomly selected from a random family group in each simulation step for visiting a random public space. An uninfected agent contracts infection if the public place is occupied by other infected agents. We have calibrated our simulation rounds according to the size of the population of the virtual community for simulating realistic exposure of agents to a contagion. Our simulation results are consistent with the publicly available hospitalization and ICU patient data from different communities of varying sizes in New York state. Our model can predict the trend in epidemic spread and hospitalization from a set of simple parameters and could be potentially useful in exploring strategies to keep a community safe.",Amitava Datta; Peter Winkelstein; Surajit Sen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215517,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215517,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True

The scale, characteristics and clinical relevance of this group are thus unknown. We performed a retrospective cohort study in two large London hospitals to characterize the demographic, clinical, and hospitalization outcome characteristics of swab-negative clinical COVID-19 patients. We found 1 in 5 patients with a negative swab and clinical suspicion of COVID-19 received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 within clinical documentation, discharge summary or death certificate. We compared this group to a similar swab positive cohort and found similar demographic composition, symptomology and laboratory findings. Swab-negative clinical COVID-19 patients had better outcomes, with shorter length of hospital stay, reduced need for >60% supplementary oxygen and reduced mortality.

219,Tocilizumab is associated with reduction in inflammation and improvement in P/F ratio in critically sick COVID19 patients,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 was initially detected in China and has been declared a global pandemic by World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In the majority of patients, SARS{square}CoV{square}2 causes a mild to moderate illness characterized by fever and respiratory symptoms, with or without evidence of pneumonia. The recent studies suggest that anti-cytokine targeted therapies might be associated with benefit for patients with severe COVID-19 especially in improving respiratory failure. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor, is associated with clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients as it inhibits IL6 and decreases inflammation.

MethodsAs Tocilizumab has been an important part of our treatment and a strict criterion was followed to administer Tocilizumab, a retrospective study design used to assess the beneficial effects of Tocilizumab in improvement of ratio partial pressure of arterial Oxygen and fraction of inspired Oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F ratio) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in COVID19 patients has been done. 60 patients were taken for this study by using convenient sampling technique the data of demographics, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes i.e. improvement of respiratory failure depicted in the form of PF Ratio were obtained from the medical records, Statistical analysis was done with SPSS, version 21.0.

ResultsSixty patients (47 males and 13 females) with COVID{square}19 were included in this study, the mean age of patients was 53.83 (14{square}81) years. After administration of Tocilizumab the lab parameters were changed as CRP decreased down to .40 (9.6{square}73) mg/L but other parameters were not affected. The PF ratio improved in COVID-19 patients after administration of Tocilizumab the median of PF Ratio before treatment was 108 (52{square}362) and improved up to 128 (37{square}406) after Tocilizumab therapy.

ConclusionIn summary, Tocilizumab appears to be associated with improvement in P/F Ratio and CRP in COVID19 patients but other markers did not improve in response to Tocilizumab therapy in severely ill COVID-19 patients.",Muhammad Asim Rana; Mubashar Sultan Hashmi; Muhammad Muneeb Ullah Saif; Muhammad Faisal Munir; Ahad Qayyum; Rizwan Pervaiz; Muhammad Mansoor Hafeez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20210195,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20210195,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
220,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a population from Veracruz (Southeastern Mexico).,"Introduction/AimRecent studies have shown that seroprevalence is quite variable depending on the country, the population and the time of the pandemic in which the serological tests are performed. Here, we investigated the prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a population living in Veracruz City, Mexico.

MethodsFrom of June 1 to July 31, 2020, the consecutive adult patients (age [&ge;]18 years) that attended 2 ambulatory diagnostic private practice centers for testing were included. Samples were run on the Abbott Architect instrument using the commercial Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. The main outcome was seroprevalence. Demographics, previous infection to SARS-CoV-2 (according to a previous positive polymerase-chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab), self-suspicious of virus of infection (according to have in the previous 4 weeks either fever, headache, respiratory symptoms but not a confirmatory PCR) or no having symptoms were also evaluated.

ResultsA total of 2174 subjects were tested, included 53.6% women (mean age 41.8{+/-}15.17 years, range 18-98 years). One thousand and forty-one (52.5%) subjects were asymptomatic, 722 (33.2%) had suspicious of infection and 311 (14.3%) had previous infection. Overall, 642 of 2174 (29.5% [95% CI 27.59%-31.47%]) of our population were seropositive. Seropositivity among groups was 21.3% in asymptomatic, 23.4% in self-suspicious patients and 73.9% in previous infection patients.

ConclusionsWe found one of the highest seroprevalences reported for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide in asymptomatic subjects (21.3%) as well in subjects with self-suspicious of COVID-19 (23.4%).

221,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in France: results from nationwide serological surveillance,"BackgroundAssessment of cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections is critical for monitoring the course and the extent of the epidemic. As asymptomatic or mild cases were typically not captured by surveillance data in France, we implemented nationwide serological surveillance. We present estimates for prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the French population and the proportion of infected individuals who developed potentially protective neutralizing antibodies throughout the first epidemic wave.

MethodsWe performed serial cross-sectional sampling of residual sera over three periods: prior to (9-15 March), during (6-12 April) and following (11-17 May) a nationwide lockdown. Each sample was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies targeting the Nucleoprotein and Spike using two Luciferase-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays, and for neutralising antibodies using a pseudo-neutralisation assay. We fitted a general linear mixed model of seropositivity in a Bayesian framework to derive prevalence estimates stratified by age, sex and region.

FindingsIn total, sera from 11 021 individuals were analysed. Nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was estimated at 0.41% [0.05-0.88] mid-March, 4.14% [3.31-4.99] mid-April and 4.93% [4.02-5.89] mid-May. Approximately 70% of seropositive individuals had detectable neutralising antibodies. Seroprevalence was higher in regions where circulation occurred earlier and was more intense. Seroprevalence was lowest in children under 10 years of age (2.72% [1.10-4.87]).

InterpretationSeroprevalence estimates confirm that the nationwide lockdown substantially curbed transmission and that the vast majority of the French population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Low seroprevalence in school age children suggests limited susceptibility and/or transmissibility in this age group. Our results show a clear picture of the progression of the first epidemic wave and provide a framework to inform the ongoing public health response as viral transmission is picking up again in France and globally.

222,"Cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19 relative to controls: An N=84,285 online study","Case studies have revealed neurological problems in severely affected COVID-19 patients. However, there is little information regarding the nature and broader prevalence of cognitive problems post-infection or across the full spread of severity. We analysed cognitive test data from 84,285 Great British Intelligence Test participants who completed a questionnaire regarding suspected and biologically confirmed COVID-19 infection. People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group and pre-existing medical disorders. They were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised, but also for mild but biologically confirmed cases who reported no breathing difficulty. Finer grained analyses of performance support the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-system impact on human cognition.

Significance statementThere is evidence that COVID-19 may cause long term health changes past acute symptoms, termed  long COVID. Our analyses of detailed cognitive assessment and questionnaire data from tens thousands of datasets, collected in collaboration with BBC2 Horizon, align with the view that there are chronic cognitive consequences of having COVID-19. Individuals who recovered from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 perform worse on cognitive tests in multiple domains than would be expected given their detailed age and demographic profiles. This deficit scales with symptom severity and is evident amongst those without hospital treatment.

224,Analytical evaluation and critical appraisal of early commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays for routine use in a diagnostic laboratory.,"BACKGROUNDThe objective of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of early commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in mild and asymptomatic subjects to enable the selection of suitable serological assays for routine diagnostic use within HCA Healthcare UK.

METHODSWe used serum samples from a pre-Covid era patient cohort (n=50, pre-December 2019), designated SARS-CoV-2 negative, and serum samples from a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive cohort (n=90) taken > 14 days post symptom onset (April-May 2020). We evaluated 6 ELISA assays including one confirmation assay to investigate antibody specificity. We also evaluated one point-of-care lateral flow device and one high throughput electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.

RESULTSThe ELISA specificities ranged from 84-100%, with sensitivities ranging from 75.3-90.0%. The LFIA showed 100% specificity and 80% sensitivity using smaller sample numbers. The Roche CLIA immunoassay showed 100% specificity and 90.7% sensitivity. When used in conjunction, the Euroimmun nucleocapsid (NC) and spike-1 (S1) IgG ELISA assays had a sensitivity of 95.6%. The confirmation IgG assay showed 92.6% of samples tested contained both NC and S1 antibodies, 32.7% had NC, S1 and S2 and 0% had either S1 or S2 only.

CONCLUSIONSThese first generation assays were not calibrated against reference material and the results are reported qualitatively. The Roche assay and the Euroimmun NC and S1 assays had the best sensitivity overall in our hands. Combining the assays detecting NC and S1/S2 antibody increased diagnostic yield.

225,Validation of expert system enhanced deep learning algorithm for automated screening for COVID-Pneumonia on chest X-rays,"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposed a limitation of artificial intelligence (AI) based medical image interpretation systems. Early in the pandemic, when need was greatest, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions. Even now, there is a need for Chest-X-ray (CxR) screening tools in low and middle income countries (LMIC), when RT-PCR is delayed, to exclude COVID-19 pneumonia (Cov-Pneum) requiring transfer to higher care. In absence of local LMIC data and poor portability of CxR DL algorithms, a new approach is needed. Axiomatically, it is faster to repurpose existing data than to generate new datasets. Here, we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool which uses an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for Cov-Pneum diagnosis, trained entirely on datasets from the pre-COVID-19 period. Portability, performance, and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. First, 1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine-center to assess effectiveness in excluding radiologic Cov-Pneum that may require higher care. Second, a curated dataset with 434 RT-PCR positive cases of varying levels of severity and 471 historical scans containing normal studies and non-COVID pathologies, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had accuracy of 87% with negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data for Cov-Pneum. However, sensitivity varied from 0.66 to 0.90 depending on whether RT-PCR or radiologist opinion was set as ground truth.

226,Preclinical study of DNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2,"To fight against the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the development of an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is required. As potential pandemic vaccines, DNA/RNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines and protein-based vaccines have been rapidly developed to prevent pandemic spread worldwide. In this study, we designed plasmid DNA vaccine targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S protein) as pandemic vaccine, and the humoral, cellular, and functional immune responses were characterized to support proceeding to initial human clinical trials. After intramuscular injection of DNA vaccine encoding S protein with alum adjuvant (three times at 2-week intervals), the humoral immunoreaction, as assessed by anti-S protein or anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody titers, and the cellular immunoreaction, as assessed by antigen-induced IFN{gamma} expression, were up-regulated. In IgG subclass analysis, IgG2b was induced as the main subclass. Based on these analyses, DNA vaccine with alum adjuvant preferentially induced Th1-type T cell polarization. We confirmed the neutralizing action of DNA vaccine-induced antibodies via two different methods, a binding assay of RBD recombinant protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and pseudovirus assay. Further B cell epitope mapping analysis using a peptide array showed that most vaccine-induced antibodies recognized the S2 and RBD subunits, but not the S1 subunit.

227,Structural basis for the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by favipiravir-RTP,"The RNA polymerase inhibitor, favipiravir, is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for infection with SARS-CoV-2, despite limited information about the molecular basis for its activity. Here we report the structure of favipiravir ribonucleoside triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) bound to a template:primer RNA duplex, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to a resolution of 2.5 [A]. The structure shows clear evidence for the inhibitor at the catalytic site of the enzyme, and resolves the conformation of key side chains and ions surrounding the binding pocket. Polymerase activity assays indicate that the inhibitor is weakly incorporated into the RNA primer strand, and suppresses RNA replication in the presence of natural nucleotides.

228,Restriction of SARS-CoV-2 Replication by Targeting Programmed -1 Ribosomal Frameshifting In Vitro,"Translation of open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) promoted by an RNA pseudoknot. The extent to which SARS-CoV-2 replication may be sensitive to changes in -1 PRF efficiency is currently unknown. Through an unbiased, reporter-based high-throughput compound screen, we identified merafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial, as a -1 PRF inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin is robust to mutations within the pseudoknot region and is similarly effective on -1 PRF of other beta coronaviruses. Importantly, frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin substantially impedes SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, thereby providing the proof of principle of targeting -1 PRF as an effective antiviral strategy for SARS-CoV-2.",Yu Sun; Laura Abriola; Yulia V.

229,A placebo-controlled double blind trial of hydroxychloroquine in mild-to-moderate COVID-19,"BackgroundThe efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial.

MethodsWe conducted a multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients with at least one of the following risk factors for worsening: age [&ge;]75 years, age between 60 and 74 years, and presence of at least one comorbidity, or need for supplemental oxygen ([&le;]3 L/min). Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800mg hydroxychloroquine on Day 0 followed by 400mg per day for 8 days or a placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or tracheal intubation within 14 days following randomization. Secondary endpoints included mortality and clinical evolution at Day 14 and 28, viral shedding at Day 5 and 10.

ResultsThe trial was stopped after 250 patients were included due to a slowdown of the pandemic in France. The intention-to-treat population comprised 123 and 124 patients in the placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, respectively. The median age was 77 years and 151 patients required oxygen therapy. The primary endpoint occurred in nine patients in the hydroxychloroquine group and eight patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1.12; 95% confidence interval 0.45- 2.80; P=0.82). No difference was observed between the two groups in any of the secondary endpoints.

Public health measures to control the virus are reliant on testing, including appropriate collection of specimens for analysis.

MethodsA prospective study of nasopharyngeal swab technique by staff in an academic tertiary referral centre was carried out. Nasopharyngeal swab technique was evaluated by a novel design of a navigated swab on a three-dimensional model head.

ResultsSwab technique of 228 participants was assessed. Technique was poor, with a success rate of nasopharyngeal swabbing at 38.6%. Angle and length of insertion were significantly different between those with successful and unsuccessful technique. Doctors were significantly more accurate than nurses and non-healthcare professionals (p<0.01).

232,Percentage HScore confirms low incidence of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in hospitalised COVID-19 patients,"ObjectiveIt has been assumed that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients show evidence of hyperinflammation of which secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is the most severe manifestation. To facilitate diagnosis of sHLH the HScore has been developed and validated. We set out to examine the prevalence of sHLH-like hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

MethodsWe retrospectively examined HScore parameters in 626 COVID-19 cases admitted to our institute of which 567 were suitable for analysis and compared these to a cohort of confirmed infection associated sHLH cases. To account for missing data, we calculated the maximum possible HScore of the recorded parameters (%HScore).

ResultsEarly measurement of HScore parameters (day -1 to 4 from diagnosis) strongly predicted the %HScore over the course of the admission (p <0.0001). The retrospective cohort of sHLH showed significantly higher %HScores as compared to COVID-19 (median 73.47 vs 18.13 respectively, p <0.0001). The overall prevalence of individuals with an 80% probability of sHLH in our COVID-19 cohort was 1.59% on admission and only rose to 4.05% during the whole disease course. In the small cohort with scores suggestive of sHLH, there was no excess mortality compared with the whole cohort. %HScores were higher in younger patients (p<0.0001) and did not reliably predict outcome at any cut-off value (AUROC 0.533, p=0.211; OR 0.99).

ConclusionSurprisingly, these findings show that sHLH-type hyperinflammation is not prevalent in COVID-19, and %HScores do not predict outcome.

234,Extending the range of COVID-19 risk factors ina Bayesian network model for personalised riskassessment,"A need is emerging for individuals to gauge their own risks of coronavirus infection as it becomes apparent that contact tracing to contain the spread of the virus is not working in many societies. This paper presents an extension of an existing Bayesian network model for an application in which people can add their own personal risk factors to calculate their probability of exposure to the virus and likely severity if they do catch the illness. The data need not be shared with any central authority. In this way, people can become more aware of their individual risks and adjust their behaviour accordingly, as many countries prepare for a second wave of infections or a prolonged pandemic. This has the advantage not only of preserving privacy but also of containing the virus more effectively by allowing users to act without the time lag of waiting to be informed that a contact has been tested and confirmed COVID-19 positive. Through a nuanced assessment of individual risk, it could also release many people from isolation who are judged highly vulnerable using cruder measures, helping to boost economic activity and decrease social isolation without unduly increasing transmission risk. Although much has been written and reported about single risk factors, little has been done to bring these factors together in a user-friendly way to give an overall risk rating. The causal probabilistic model presented here shows the power of Bayesian networks to represent the interplay of multiple, dependent variables and to predict outcomes. The network, designed for use in the UK, is built using detailed data from government and health authorities and the latest research, and is capable of dynamic updates as new information becomes available.

235,"Efficacy of stay-at-home policy and transmission of COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada: a mathematical modeling study","BackgroundIn many parts of the world, restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) that aim to reduce contact rates, including stay-at-home orders, limitations on gatherings, and closure of public places, are being lifted, with the possibility that the epidemic resurges if alternative measures are not strong enough. Here we aim to capture the combination of use of NPIs and reopening measures which will prevent an infection rebound.

MethodsWe employ an SEAIR model with household structure able to capture the stay-at-home policy (SAHP). To reflect the changes in the SAHP over the course of the epidemic, we vary the SAHP compliance rate, assuming that the time to compliance of all the people requested to stay-at-home follows a Gamma distribution. Using confirmed case data for the City of Toronto, we evaluate basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers and simulate how the average household size, the stay-at-home rate, the efficiency and duration of SAHP implementation, affect the outbreak trajectory.

FindingsThe estimated basic reproduction number R_0 was 2.36 (95% CI: 2.28, 2.45) in Toronto. After the implementation of the SAHP, the contact rate outside the household fell by 39%. When people properly respect the SAHP, the outbreak can be quickly controlled, but extending its duration beyond two months (65 days) had little effect. Our findings also suggest that to avoid a large rebound of the epidemic, the average number of contacts per person per day should be kept below nine. This study suggests that fully reopening schools, offices, and other activities, is possible if the use of other NPIs is strictly adhered to.

InterpretationOur model confirmed that the SAHP implemented in Toronto had a great impact in controlling the spread of COVID-19. Given the lifting of restrictive NPIs, we estimated the thresholds values of maximum number of contacts, probability of transmission and testing needed to ensure that the reopening will be safe, i.e. maintaining an Rt < 1.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA survey on published articles was made through PubMed and Google Scholar searches. The search was conducted from March 1 to August 13, 2020 and all papers published until the end of this research were considered. The following terms were used to screen articles on mathematical models: ""household structure"", ""epidemic model"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""household SIR epidemic"", ""household SIS epidemic"", ""household SEIR epidemic"", ""quarantine, isolation model"", ""quarantine model dynamics"", ""structured model isolation"". Any article showing, in the title, application of epidemic models in a specific country/region or infectious diseases rather than SARS-CoV-2 were excluded. Articles in English were considered.

Added value of this studyWe develop an epidemic model with household structure to study the effects of SAHP on the infection within households and transmission of COVID-19 in Toronto. The complex model provides interesting insights into the effectiveness of SAHP, if the average number of individuals in a household changes. We found that the SAHP might not be adequate if the size of households is relatively large. We also introduce a new quantity called symptomatic diagnosis completion ratio (d_c). This indicator is defined as the ratio of cumulative reported cases and the cumulative cases by episode date at time t, and it is used in the model to inform the implementation of SAHP.

If cases are diagnosed at the time of symptom onset, isolation will be enforced immediately. A delay in detecting cases will lead to a delay in isolation, with subsequent increase in the transmission of the infection. Comparing different scenarios (before and after reopening phases), we were able to identify thresholds of these factors which mainly affect the spread of the infection: the number of daily tests, average number of contacts per individual, and probability of transmission of the virus. Our results show that if any of the three above mentioned factors is reduced, then the other two need to be adjusted to keep a reproduction number below 1. Lifting restrictive closures will require the average number of contacts a person has each day to be less than pre-COVID-19, and a high rate of case detection and tracing of contacts. The thresholds found will inform public health decisions on reopening.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings provide important information for policymakers when planning the full reopening phase. Our results confirm that prompt implementation of SAHP was crucial in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Also, based on our analyses, we propose public health alternatives to consider in view of a full reopening. For example, for different post-reopening scenarios, the average number of contacts per person needs to be reduced if the symptomatic diagnosis completion ratio is low and the probability of transmission increases. Namely, if fewer tests are completed and the usage of NPIs decreases, then the epidemic can be controlled only if individuals can maintain contact with a maximum average number of 4-5 people per person per day. Different recommendations can be provided by relaxing/strengthening one of the above-mentioned factors.",Pei Yuan; Juan Li; Elena Aruffo; Qi Li; Tingting Zheng; Nicholas Ogden; Beate Sander; Jane Heffernan; Evgenia Gatov; Effie Gournis; Sarah Collier; Yi Tan; Jun Li; Julien Arino; Jacques Belair; James Watmough; Jude Dzevela Kong; Iain Moyles; Huaiping Zhu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20181057,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20181057,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
236,From multiplex serology to serolomics: A novel approach to the antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome,"BackgroundThe emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic entails an urgent need for specific and sensitive high-throughput serological assays to assess SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. We therefore aimed at developing a fluorescent-bead based SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay for detection of antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome.

MethodsProteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and protein N of SARS-CoV-1 and common cold Coronaviruses (ccCoVs) were recombinantly expressed in E. coli or HEK293 cells. Assay performance was assessed in a Covid-19 case cohort (n=48 hospitalized patients from Heidelberg) as well as n=85 age- and sex-matched pre-pandemic controls from the ESTHER study. Assay validation included comparison with home-made immunofluorescence and commercial Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays.

ResultsA sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 86%-100%) was achieved in Covid-19 patients 14 days post symptom onset with dual sero-positivity to SARS-CoV-2 N and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The specificity obtained with this algorithm was 100% (95% CI: 96%-100%). Antibody responses to ccCoVs N were abundantly high and did not correlate with those to SARS-CoV-2 N. Inclusion of additional SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as separate assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) classes M, A, and G allowed for explorative analyses regarding disease progression and course of antibody response.

ConclusionThis newly developed SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay achieved high sensitivity and specificity to determine SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity. Its high throughput ability allows epidemiologic SARS-CoV-2 research in large population-based studies.

237,Modelling the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 on a dynamic network graph,"BackgroundWhen modelling the dispersion of an epidemic using R0, one only considers the average number of individuals each infected individual will infect. However, we know from extensive studies of social networks that there is significant variation in the number of connections and thus social contacts each individual has. Individuals with more social contacts are more likely to attract and spread infection. These individuals are likely the drivers of the epidemic, so-called superspreaders. When many superspreaders are immune, it becomes more difficult for the disease to spread, as the connectedness of the social network dramatically decreases. If one assumes all individuals being equally connected and thus as likely to spread disease as in a SIR model, this is not true.

MethodsTo account for the impact of social network structure on epidemic development, we model the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 on a dynamic preferential attachment graph which changes appearance proportional to observed mobility changes. We sample a serial interval distribution that determines the probability of dispersion for all infected nodes each day. We model the dispersion in different age groups using age-specific infection fatality rates. We vary the infection probabilities in different age groups and analyse the outcome.

ResultsThe impact of movement on network dynamics plays a crucial role in the spread of infections. We find that higher movement results in higher spread due to an increased probability of new connections being made within a social network. We show that saturation in the dispersion can be reached much earlier on a preferential attachment graph compared to spread on a random graph, which is more similar to estimations using R0.

ConclusionsWe provide a novel method for modelling epidemics by using a dynamic network structure related to observed mobility changes.

238,Effect of park use and landscape structure on COVID-19 transmission rates,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe impacts on global public health. In the UK, social distancing measures and a nationwide lockdown were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus. Green space accessibility may have been particularly important during this lockdown, as it could have provided benefits for physical and mental wellbeing, while also limiting the risk of transmission. However, the effects of public green space use on the rate of COVID-19 transmission are yet to be quantified, and as the size and accessibility of green spaces vary within local authorities, the risks and benefits to the public of using green space may well be context-dependent. To evaluate how green space affected COVID-19 transmission across 98 local authorities in England, we first split case rates into two periods, the pre-peak rise and the post-peak decline in cases, and assessed how baseline health and mobility variables influenced these rates. Next, looking at the residual case rates, we investigated how landscape structure (e.g. area and patchiness of green space) and park use influenced transmission. We first show that pre- and post-peak case rates were significantly reduced when overall mobility was low, especially in areas with high population clustering, and high population density during the post-peak period only. After accounting for known mechanisms behind transmission rates, we found that park use (showing a preference for park mobility) decreased residual pre-peak case rates, especially when green space was low and contiguous (not patchy). Whilst in the post-peak period, park use and green landscape structure had no effect on residual case rates. Our results show that utilising green spaces rather than other activities (e.g. visiting shops and workplaces) can reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19, especially during an exponential phase of transmission.",Thomas Frederick Johnson; Lisbeth A Hordley; Matthew P Greenwell; Luke C Evans,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215731,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215731,2020-10-21,2020-10-21,,True
239,Differential Impact of Mitigation Policies and Socioeconomic Status on COVID-19 Prevalence and Social Distancing in the United States,"BackgroundThe spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the long-standing health inequalities across the U.S. as neighborhoods with fewer resources were associated with higher rates of COVID-19 transmission. Although the stay-at-home order was one of the most effective methods to contain its spread, residents in lower-income neighborhoods faced barriers to practicing social distancing. We aimed to quantify the differential impact of stay-at-home policy on COVID-19 transmission and residents mobility across neighborhoods of different levels of socioeconomic disadvantage.

MethodsThis was a comparative interrupted time-series analysis at the county level. We included 2,087 counties from 38 states which both implemented and lifted the state-wide stay-at-home order. Every county was assigned to one of four equally-sized groups based on its levels of disadvantage, represented by the Area Deprivation Index. Prevalence of COVID-19 was calculated by dividing the daily number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases by the number of residents from the 2010 Census. We used the Social Distancing Index, derived from the COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, to measure the social distancing practice. For the evaluation of implementation, the observation started from Mar 1 St 2020 to one day before lifting; and, for lifting, it ranged from one day after implementation to Jul 5 th 2020. We calculated a comparative change of daily trends in COVID-19 prevalence and Social Distancing Index between counties with three highest disadvantage levels and those with the least level before and after the implementation and lifting of the stay-at-home order, separately.

ResultsOn both stay-at-home implementation and lifting dates, COVID-19 prevalence was much higher among counties with the highest or lowest disadvantage level, while mobility decreased as the disadvantage level increased. Mobility of the most disadvantaged counties was least impacted by stay-at-home implementation and relaxation compared to counties with the most resources; however, disadvantaged counties experienced the largest relative increase in COVID-19 infection after both stay-at-home implementation and relaxation.

ConclusionsNeighborhoods with varying levels of socioeconomic disadvantage reacted differently to the implementation and relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation policies.

240,2.5 Million Person-Years of Life Have Been Lost Due to COVID-19 in the United States,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by tens of millions of SARS-CoV-2 infections world-wide, has resulted in considerable levels of mortality and morbidity. The United States has been hit particularly hard having 20 percent of the world's infections but only 4 percent of the world population. Unfortunately, significant levels of misunderstanding exist about the severity of the disease and its lethality. As COVID-19 disproportionally impacts elderly populations, the false impression that the impact on society of these deaths is minimal may be conveyed by some because elderly individuals are closer to a natural death. To assess the impact of COVID-19 in the US, I have performed calculations of person-years of life lost as a result of 194,000 premature deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection as of early October, 2020. By combining actuarial data on life expectancy and the distribution of COVID-19 associated deaths we estimate that over 2,500,000 person-years of life have been lost so far in the pandemic in the US alone, averaging over 13.25 years per person with differences noted between males and females.

241,"A Sensitive, Rapid, and Portable CasRx-based Diagnostic Assay for SARS-CoV2","Since its first emergence from China in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally despite unprecedented containment efforts, resulting in a catastrophic worldwide pandemic. Successful identification and isolation of infected individuals can drastically curtail virus spread and limit outbreaks. However, during the early stages of global transmission, point-of-care diagnostics were largely unavailable and continue to remain difficult to procure, greatly inhibiting public health efforts to mitigate spread. Furthermore, the most prevalent testing kits rely on reagent- and time-intensive protocols to detect viral RNA, preventing rapid and cost-effective diagnosis. Therefore the development of an extensive toolkit for point-of-care diagnostics that is expeditiously adaptable to new emerging pathogens is of critical public health importance. Recently, a number of novel CRISPR-based diagnostics have been developed to detect COVID-19. Herein, we outline the development of a CRISPR-based nucleic acid molecular diagnostic utilizing a Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) to detect SARS-CoV-2, an approach we term SENSR (Sensitive Enzymatic Nucleic-acid Sequence Reporter).

We longitudinally profiled the early humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and quantify levels of pre-existing immunity to OC43, HKU1 and 223E seasonal coronaviruses. A strong back-boosting effect to conserved, but not variable regions of OC43 and HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike protein was observed. All patients developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, with peak induction at day 7 post hospitalization.

243,Prediction of Covid-19 Infections Through December 2020 for 10 US States Incorporating Outdoor Temperature and School Re-Opening Effects-September Update,"A two-parameter, human behavior Covid-19 infection growth model predicts total infections between-4.2% (overprediction) and 4.5% (underprediction) of actual infections from July 27, 2020 to September 30, 2020 for 10 US States (NY, WA, GA, IL, MN, FL, OH, MI, CA, NC). During that time, total Covid-19 infections for 9 of the 10 modeled US States grew by 60% (MI) to 95% (MN). Only NY limited Covid-19 infection growth with an 11% increase from July 27 to September 30, 2020.

September is a month with contraposing effects of increased social interaction (eg, physical school openings) and outdoor temperatures decreasing to the 50F (10C) to 70F (21C) range in which outdoor activities and building ventilation are beneficially increased. All State infection predictions except GA, FL and CA predictions through September 30 are bounded by four prediction scenarios (no school with outdoor temperature effect, no school with no outdoor temperature effect, school with temperature effect, school with no temperature effect). GA, FL and CA continued along a path slightly below the linear infection growth boundary separating infection growth and decay, resulting in overprediction of infection growth over the two month simulation period(-3.1% for GA, -1.9% for FL, and -4.5% for CA).

Three eastern States (NY, NC, and GA) are most accurately represented by models that assume no significant change in social interactions coupled with minor outdoor temperature effects. Four midwestern States (IL, MI, MN, OH) are most accurately modeled with minor outdoor temperature effects due to a delayed decrease in average outdoor temperatures in the Midwest. The remaining three States (WA, FL, and CA) are also in good agreement with the model but with differing weather condition and social interaction impacts.

Overall, model predictions continue to support the basic premise that human behavior in the US oscillates across a linear infection growth boundary that divides accelerated infection growth and decaying infection transmission.",Ty A Newell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213223,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213223,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
244,Characteristics and evolution of COVID-19 cases in Brazil: mathematical modeling and simulation,"The pandemic caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), represents a threat of great magnitude not faced in this century. As a result, each government has proposed emergency public health measures that are critical to delay the transmission and spread of the virus and mitigate its impacts. In Brazil, the outbreak triggered many cases of people infected with COVID-19. Considering there are no drugs or vaccines proven to be effective to treat the disease, analyzing the data of infection cases and their mathematical interpretation are essential for supporting and guiding governmental measures to suppress and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This means that estimates with mathematical models to assess the development potential of sustained human-human transmission are needed. Since the disease has its own biological characteristics, the models need to be adapted to the variability of the regions characteristics and the decision-making by both the government and the population, in order to be able to deal with real situations. Thus, in the present paper, we analyzed the official data of COVID-19 in Brazil and used the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation to predict the evolution of the disease. The model indicates that a nucleation rate is of fourth order, which indicates that Brazilians are crowding with no respect to measures of social distance and disease prevention. In our opinion, the political authorities were unable to control the spread of the disease in Brazil, given that social mobility was interrupted by the federal and state governments.",Carlos Augusto Cardoso Passos Sr.; Estefano Aparecido Vieira Sr.; Jose Andre Lourenco Sr.; Jefferson Oliveira do Nacimento Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212829,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212829,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
245,Integration of Kalman filter in the epidemiological model: a robust approach to predict COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh,"As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh have been trying to contain the impact of a pandemic like COVID-19 since March, 2020. Although government announced an array of restricted measures to slow down the diffusion in the beginning of the pandemic, the lockdown has been lifted gradually by reopening all the industries, markets and offices with a notable exception of educational institutes. As the physical geography of Bangladesh is highly variable across the largest delta, the population of different region and their life style also differ. Thus, to get the real scenario of the current pandemic across Bangladesh, it is essential to analyze the transmission dynamics over the individual districts. In this article, we propose to integrate the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with classic SIRD model to explain the epidemic evolution of individual districts in the country. We show that UKF-SIRD model results in a robust prediction of the transmission dynamics for 1-4 months. Then we apply the robust UKF-SIRD model over different regions in Bangladesh to estimates the course of the epidemic. Our analysis demonstrate that in addition to the densely populated areas, industrial areas and popular tourist spots are in the risk of higher COVID-19 transmission. In the light of these outcomes, we provide a set of suggestions to contain the pandemic in Bangladesh. All the data and relevant codebase is available at https://mjonyh.github.io.",Md.

246,"A Multiplexed, Next Generation Sequencing Platform for High-Throughput Detection of SARS-CoV-2","Population scale sweeps of viral pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, that incorporate large numbers of asymptomatic or mild symptom patients present unique challenges for public health agencies trying to manage both travel and local spread. Physical distancing is the current major strategy to suppress spread of the disease, but with enormous socio-economic costs. However, modelling and studies in isolated jurisdictions suggest that active population surveillance through systematic molecular diagnostics, combined with contact tracing and focused quarantining can significantly suppress disease spread1-3 and has significantly impacted disease transmission rates, the number of infected people, and prevented saturation of the healthcare system4-7. However, reliable systems allowing for parallel testing of 10-100,000s of patients in larger urban environments have not yet been employed. Here we describe ""COVID-19 screening using Systematic Parallel Analysis of RNA coupled to Sequencing"" (C19-SPAR-Seq), a scalable, multiplexed, readily automated next generation sequencing (NGS) platform8 that is capable of analyzing tens of thousands of COVID-19 patient samples in a single instrument run. To address the strict requirements in clinical diagnostics for control of assay parameters and output, we employed a control-based Precision-Recall and predictive Receiver Operator Characteristics (coPR) analysis to assign run-specific quality control metrics. C19-SPAR-Seq coupled to coPR on a trial cohort of over 600 patients performed with a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 91% on samples with low viral loads and a sensitivity of > 95% on high viral loads associated with disease onset and peak transmissibility.

247,Characteristics of COVID-19 Clinical Trials in India Based on the Registration Data on CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry- India): a cross-sectional analysis,"ObjectivesThe 2019 pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has prompted several efforts to find safe and effective drugs, but little is understood as to where early efforts were centered. Several clinical trials, both Allopathy and AYUSH medicines have been registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI). We aimed to characterize and extract relevant data registered under CTRI for COVID-19.

Materials and MethodsA cross-sectional analysis was performed of clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 that were registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) from 1st March 2020 to 22nd June 2020. Relevant trial records were downloaded, deduplicated, and independently analyzed by three reviewers.

Main outcomesTrial intervention, design, sponsorship, phase of the trial, and indicated outcomes.

Results233 COVID-19 clinical trials, was registered from India in CTRI. Out of these, 146 were Interventional trials, 84 Observational trials, and three Post-marketing surveillance. Questionnaire and survey-based intervention occupy a significant portion. Randomized control trials are large in number 37.8% than non-randomized. 20% of the trials were recruiting patients, and the Research institution (34%) sponsored more than half of the trials. Global trials are minimal, occupying 3% of total trials and Indian trials were 97%. In most of the trials, the interventional agent is either multiple drug combinations or compound drug formulations compared to single drug administration. Among the trials, 46 Allopathic interventions, 41 Ayurveda interventions, 14 Homeopathy interventions, one in Unani, and 2 in yoga and Naturopathy.

250,Examining the decision to offer in-person college instruction during the COVID-19 era: A multilevel analysis of the factors that affected intentions to open,"At the end of Summer 2020 colleges and universities had to make difficult decisions about whether to return to in-person instruction. While opening campuses could pose a major health risk, keeping instruction online could dissuade students from enrolling. Taking an ecological approach that considers the influence of state, county, and college characteristics, this study uses mixed modeling techniques and data from 89% of two- and four-year public and four-year private US colleges to assess the factors that shaped their decision to provide mostly in-person instruction as of August 1, 2020. We consider the roles of the political and religious climate, COVID-19 infections, deaths, and mask mandates, college niche, finances, dormitory capacity, faculty resistance, online readiness, and enrollment pressures. Most notably, we find that decision-making was unrelated to cumulative COVID infection and related mortality rates. The strongest predictor of in-person instruction was the proportion of state residents who voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. We also find that dormitory capacity, percentage of revenue from tuition, institutional importance to the local economy, graduation rates, and per capita endowment were associated with providing in-person instruction.",Jacob Felson; Amy Adamczyk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213363,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213363,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True

252,COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies predict disease severity and survival,"COVID-19 exhibits variable symptom severity ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and the humoral immune response is poorly understood. We examined antibody responses in 113 COVID-19 patients and found that severe cases resulting in intubation or death exhibited increased inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and high anti-RBD antibody levels. While anti-RBD IgG levels generally correlated with neutralization titer, quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a predictor of survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting protection from reinfection by this strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera was unable to cross-neutralize a highly-homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, that has not yet crossed the species barrier. These results highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity on disease progression and the need to develop broadly protective interventions to prevent future coronavirus pandemics.",Wilfredo F Garcia-Beltran; Evan C Lam; Michael G Astudillo; Diane Yang; Tyler E Miller; Jared Feldman; Blake M Hauser; Timothy M Caradonna; Kiera L Clayton; Adam D Nitido; Mandakolathur R Murali; Galit Alter; Richelle C Charles; Anand Dighe; John A Branda; Jochen K Lennerz; Daniel Lingwood; Aaron G Schmidt; A.

253,FebriDx point-of-care test in patients with suspected COVID-19: a pooled diagnostic accuracy study,"BackgroundPoint-of-care (POC) tests for COVID-19 could relieve pressure on isolation resource, support infection prevention and control, and help commence more timely and appropriate treatment. We aimed to undertake a systematic review and pooled diagnostic test accuracy study of available individual patient data (IPD) to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a commercial POC test (FebriDx) in patients with suspected COVID-19.

MethodsA literature search was performed on the 1st of October 2020 to identify studies reporting diagnostic accuracy statistics of the FebriDx POC test versus real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. Studies were screened for risk of bias. IPD were sought from studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the study effect on the outcome of the RT-PCR test result in order to determine whether it was appropriate to pool results. Diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results15 studies were screened, and we included two published studies with 527 hospitalised patients. 523 patients had valid FebriDx results for Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), an antiviral host response protein. The FebriDx test produced a pooled sensitivity of 0.920 (95% CI: 0.875-0.950) and specificity of 0.862 (0.819-0.896) compared with RT-PCR, where there was an estimated true COVID-19 prevalence of 0.405 (0.364-0.448) and overall FebriDx test yield was 99.2%. Patients were tested at a median of 4 days [interquartile range: 2:9] after symptom onset. No differences were found in a sub-group analysis of time tested since the onset of symptoms.

ConclusionsBased on a large sample of patients from two studies during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the FebriDx POC test had reasonable diagnostic accuracy in a hospital setting with high COVID-19 prevalence, out of influenza season. More research is required to determine how FebriDx would perform in other healthcare settings with higher or lower COVID-19 prevalence, different patient populations, or when other respiratory infections are in circulation.

Trial registrationThis work was based on a pooled analysis of anonymised data from two previous studies; the CoV-19POC study, described by Clark et al. (9), the ""Southampton study"" [ISRCTN:14966673, date registered: 18/03/2020]; and a study described by Karim et al. (13) the ""Kettering study"".

Lay summaryTests to diagnose COVID-19 are crucial to help control the spread of the disease and to guide treatment. Over the last few months, tests have been developed that can detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19. These tests use complex machines in pathology laboratories accepting samples from large geographical areas. Sometimes it takes days for test results to come back. So, to reduce the wait for results, new portable tests are being developed. These point-of-care (POC) tests are designed to work close to where patients require assessment and care such as hospital emergency departments, GP surgeries or care homes. For these new POC tests to be useful, they should ideally be as good as standard laboratory tests so patients get their result quickly and can benefit from the best, safest care.

In this study we looked at published research into a new test, FebriDx, which can detect the presence of any viral infection, including infections due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as bacterial infections which can have similar symptoms. The FebriDx result was compared with that obtained on the same patients throat and nose swab and using the standard COVID-19 viral laboratory test. We were able to analyse data from two studies with a total of 523 adult patients who were receiving emergency hospital care with symptoms of COVID-19 during the early stage of the UK pandemic. Almost half of the patients were diagnosed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus using standard laboratory COVID-19 viral tests.

Our analysis demonstrated that the FebriDx POC test agreed 94 out of 100 times with the standard laboratory test results when FebriDx diagnosed the patient as free from COVID-19. However, FebriDx agreed only 82 out of 100 times with the standard laboratory test when FebriDx indicated that the patient had a COVID-19 infection. These differences have important implications for how these tests could be used. As there were far fewer FebriDx false results when the results of the FebriDx test were negative (6 out of 100) than when the results of the FebriDx test were positive (18 out of 100), we can have more confidence in a negative test result using FebriDx at the POC than a positive FebriDx result.

Overall, we have shown that the FebriDx POC test performed quite well during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with laboratory tests, especially when the POC test returned a negative test. For the future, this means that the FebriDx POC test might be helpful in making a rapid clinical decision whether to isolate a patient with COVID-19-like symptoms arriving in a busy emergency department. However, our results indicate it would not completely replace the need to conduct a confirmatory laboratory test in certain cases.

There are limitations to our findings. For example, we do not know if FebriDx will work in a similar way with patients in different settings such as in the community or care homes. Similarly, we do not know whether other viral and bacterial infections which cause similar COVID-19 symptoms, and are more common in the autumn and winter months, could influence the FebriDx test accuracy.",Samuel G Urwin; B Clare Lendrem; Jana Suklan; Kile Green; Sara Graziadio; Peter Buckle; Paul M Dark; Adam L Gordon; Daniel S Lasserson; Brian Nicholson; D Ashley Price; Charles Reynard; Mark H Wilcox; Graham Prestwich; Valerie Tate; Tristan W Clark; Raja V Reddy; Richard Body; A Joy Allen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213108,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213108,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
254,Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) is an effective alternative for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection in middle-income countries,"Molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in developing countries is still a big challenge. The reference standard, RT-qPCR, recommended by WHO, is not widely available, difficulting early identification of cases. Furthermore, the transport logistic between the sample collection point and the laboratory facilities can alter the samples, producing false negative results. RT-LAMP is a cheaper, simpler molecular technique that can be an interesting alternative to be offered in hospital laboratories. We present the evaluation of a RT-LAMP for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in two steps: the laboratory standardization and the clinical validation, comparing it with the standard RT-qPCR. In the standardization phase, limit of detection and robustness values were obtained using RNA from a Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 strain. It presented 100% agreement between triplicates (RT-LAMP agreement with all RT-qPCR reactions that presented Ct [&le;] 30) and robustness (RT-LAMP successful reactions with 80% reaction volume and 50% primer concentration). 384 nasal and pharyngeal swabs collected from symptomatic patients and stored in the INS biobank were tested and we obtained 98.75%, 87.41%, 97.65% and 92.96% for specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values respectively. Then, 383 samples from symptomatic patients with less than 15 days of disease, were tested both with the RT-LAMP and with the RT-qPCR, obtaining e 98.8%, 88.1%, 97.7% y 93.3% of specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values respectively. The laboratory standardization and the clinical validation presented the same value by Kappa-Cohen index (0.88) indicating an almost perfect agreement between RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that this RT-LAMP protocol presented high diagnostic performance values and can be an effective alternative for COVID-19 molecular diagnosis in hospitals, contributing to early diagnosis and reducing the spread of virus transmission in the Peruvian population.",Oscar Escalante-Maldonado; Margot Vidal-Anzardo; Fernando Donaires; GIlmer Solis-Sanchez; Italo Gallesi; Luis Pampa-Espinoza; Maribel Huaringa; Nancy Rojas-Serrano; Coralith Garcia; Eddie Angles-Yanqui; Ronnie Gustavo Gavilan; RIcardo Duraes-Carvalho; Cesar Cabezas; Paulo Vitor Marques Simas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212977,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212977,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
255,Intravenous Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Extracorporeal Oxygenation Patients with Severe COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"BackgroundThere is an ongoing critical need to improve therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the most severely affected patients. Adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions have the potential to benefit critically ill patients with acute respiratory syndrome SARS-COV-2 infection, but clinical data supporting efficacy are lacking.

MethodsWe conducted a case-control study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To evaluate clinical responsiveness in the most critically ill patient we examined outcomes in a sub-group of those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Patients (n=9) were administered with up to 3 infusions of intravenous (IV) MSCs and compared to a local ECMO control group (n=31). The primary outcome was safety, and the secondary outcomes were all- cause mortality (or rate of hospital discharge), cytokine levels, and viral clearance.

FindingsMSC infusions (12 patients) were well tolerated and no side effects occurred. Of ECMO patients receiving MSC infusions, 2 out of 9 died (22.2%; 95%CI: 2.8%, 60.0%) compared with a mortality of 15 of 31 (48.4%; 95%CI: 30.2%, 66.9%; p = 0.25) in the ECMO control group. Isolated plasma exosomes containing the SARS-COV-2 Spike protein decreased after MSC infusions between day 14 or 21 after administration (p=0.003 and p=0.005, respectively) and was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 IgG Spike protein titer at same time points (p = 0.006 and p=0.007, respectively). Control ECMO patients receiving convalescent plasma did not clear COVID-19 IgG over the same time frame.

InterpretationTogether these findings suggest that MSC IV infusion is well tolerated in patients with a broad range of severity including the most severe COVID-19 ARDS requiring ECMO. These data also raise the possibility that MSCs, in addition to exerting an immunomodulatory effect, contribute to viral clearance and strongly support the conduct of randomized placebo-controlled trial.",Sunjay Kaushal; Aisha Khan; Kristopher Deatrick; Derek K Ng; Abigail Snyder; Aakash Shah; Lina V Caceres; Ketty Bacallao; Melania Bembea; Allen Everett; Jie Zhu; David Kaczorowski; Ronson Madathil; Ali Tabatabai; Geoffrey Rosenthal; Adriana Brooks; Bangon Longsomboon; Rachana Mishra; Progyaparamita Saha; Yvenie Desire; Russell Saltzman; Kim G Hankey; Sixto A Arias; Folusakin Ayoade; Jairo A.

256,Indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric health-care use and severe disease: a retrospective national cohort study,"BackgroundSevere disease directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is rare. However, the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric health have not been fully quantified. We examined paediatric health-care utilisation, incidence of severe disease, and mortality during the lockdown period in Scotland.

MethodsThis national retrospective cohort study examined national data for emergency childhood primary and secondary care utilisation following national lockdown on March 23, 2020. To determine whether social distancing measures and caregiver behavioural changes were associated with delayed care-seeking and increased disease severity on presentation, unplanned, emergency admissions requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for the two national Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) were analysed. PICU admissions were grouped by diagnostic category, and disease severity on presentation calculated. National statutory death records were consulted to establish childhood mortality rates and causes of death. For all observations, the lockdown period was compared to equivalent dates in 2016-2019.

FindingsWe identified 273,455 unscheduled primary care attendances; 462,437 emergency department attendances; 54,076 emergency hospital admissions; 413 PICU emergency admissions; and 415 deaths during the lockdown study period and equivalent dates in previous years. The rates of emergency presentations to primary and secondary care fell during lockdown in comparison to previous years. Emergency PICU admissions for children requiring invasive mechanical ventilation also fell, with an odds ratio of 0{middle dot}52 for chance of admission during lockdown (95% CI 0{middle dot}37-0{middle dot}73, p < 0{middle dot}001). Clinical severity scores did not suggest children were presenting with more advanced disease. The greatest reduction in PICU admissions was for diseases of the respiratory system; those for injury, poisoning or other external causes were equivalent to previous years. Mortality during lockdown did not change significantly compared to 2016-2019.

InterpretationNational lockdown led a reduction in paediatric emergency care utilisation, without associated evidence of severe harm.

We searched PubMed and medRxiv on October 13, 2020, for studies published from Jan 1, 2020 examining the indirect effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and associated changes in caregiver health-care seeking behaviour, on the risk of severe paediatric disease and death. We used the search terms COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, non-pharmaceutical interventions, indirect, and children, as well as manually searching references in other relevant papers. Terms were searched individually and in combination as necessary, with no language restrictions. We identified one study that modelled the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on child deaths in low- and middle-income countries. Other studies analysed in isolation the effects of NPIs and other behavioural changes on emergency department attendances, hospital admission rates, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission rates, or the incidence of specific presentations, such as asthma exacerbations. Some case series described delayed care-seeking for children with non-SARS-CoV-2 disease. We did not identify any national studies examining the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of severe paediatric disease and mortality.

Added value of this studyThis national study quantified the changes following national lockdown in Scotland on March 23, 2020. We examined data for unscheduled primary care and emergency department attendances, emergency hospital admissions, emergency paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, and paediatric mortality. Rates were compared with previous years. We found a reduction in paediatric emergency care utilisation rates associated with national lockdown. This reduction is likely to be due to a combination of changes in health care seeking behavior, and a fall in overall burden of paediatric infectious disease. These measures did not appear to have been associated with evidence of severe harm to children in Scotland, as evidenced by severity scores on presentation to PICU or mortality.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis is the first comprehensive population-based assessment at a national level of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on severe paediatric morbidity and mortality. Despite a significant reduction in health-care utilisation rates, we did not find associated evidence of severe harm. This study will assist policy makers, health-care providers and the public in evaluating the effects of lockdown on the risk of severe paediatric disease at a population level.",Thomas C Williams; Clare MacRae; Olivia Swann; Haris Haseeb; Steve Cunningham; Philip Davies; Neil Gibson; Christopher Lamb; Richard Levin; Catherine McDougall; Jillian McFadzean; Ian Piper; Alastair Turner; Steve Turner; Margrethe Van Dijke; Don Urquhart; Bruce Guthrie; Ross Langley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20212308,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20212308,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
257,A Comparative Analysis of System Features Used in the TREC-COVID Information Retrieval Challenge,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a rapidly growing quantity of scientific publications from journal articles, preprints, and other sources. The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Based on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a systems ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search. While our study has some limitations in its generalizability and scope of techniques analyzed, we identified some IR techniques that may be useful in building search systems for COVID-19 using the TREC-COVID test collections.",Jimmy Chen; William Hersh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213645,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213645,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
258,"Treatment with human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells for COVID-19 patients with lung damage: a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase 2 trial","BACKGROUNDTreatment of severe Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging. We performed a phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of human umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage, based on our phase 1 data.

METHODSIn this randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 101 severe COVID-19 patients with lung damage. They were randomly assigned to receive either UC-MSCs (4 x 107 cells per infusion) or placebo on day 0, 3, and 6. The primary endpoint was an altered proportion of whole lung lesion volumes from baseline to day 28. Other imaging outcomes, 6-minute walk test, maximum vital capacity, diffusing capacity, and adverse events were recorded and analysed.

RESULTS100 COVID-19 patients were finally recruited to receive either UC-MSCs (n = 65) or placebo (n = 35). UC-MSCs administration exerted numerical improvement in whole lung lesion volume from baseline to day 28 compared with the placebo (the median difference was -13.31%, 95%CI -29.14%, 2.13%, P=0.080). UC-MSCs significantly reduced the proportions of solid component lesion volume compared with the placebo (median difference: -15.45%; 95% CI -30.82%, -0.39%; P=0.043). The 6-minute walk test showed an increased distance in patients treated with UC-MSCs (difference: 27.00 m; 95% CI 0.00, 57.00; P=0.057). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.

CONCLUSIONSUC-MSCs treatment is a safe and potentially effective therapeutic approach for COVID-19 patients with lung damage. (Funded by The National Key R&D Program of China and others.

259,Different mutations in SARS-CoV-2 associate with severe and mild outcome,"IntroductionGenomic alterations in a viral genome can lead to either better or worse outcome and identifying these mutations is of utmost importance. Here, we correlated protein-level mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus to clinical outcome.

MethodsMutations in viral sequences from the GISAID virus repository were evaluated by using ""hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019"" as the reference. Patient outcomes were classified as mild disease, hospitalization and severe disease (death or documented treatment in an intensive-care unit). Chi-square test was applied to examine the association between each mutation and patient outcome. False discovery rate was computed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing and results passing a FDR cutoff of 5% were accepted as significant.

ResultMutations were mapped to amino acid changes for 2,120 non-silent mutations. Mutations correlated to mild outcome were located in the ORF8, NSP6, ORF3a, NSP4, and in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N. Mutations associated with inferior outcome were located in the surface (S) glycoprotein, in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, in the 3-to5 exonuclease, in ORF3a, NSP2 and N. Mutations leading to severe outcome with low prevalence were found in the surface (S) glycoprotein and in NSP7. Five out of 17 of the most significant mutations mapped onto a 10 amino acid long phosphorylated stretch of N indicating that in spite of obvious sampling restrictions the approach can find functionally relevant sites in the viral genome.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate that mutations in the viral genes may have a direct correlation to clinical outcome.

260,The Safety of Contemporary Planned Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has put an unprecedented burden on global healthcare, including detrimental implications for the volume and provision of surgical services. The aim of this audit was to assess if the planned surgical cancer care (both diagnostic for possible cancer, and treatment of known cancer) during this period of widespread community and hospital based COVID-19 infection resulted in patients acquiring symptomatic COVID-19 as a consequence of their surgical admission, and if so, what the impact on patients was.

MethodsA prospective audit of all patients undergoing elective cancer surgery in Greater Manchester operated on between 01/05/2020 and 31/06/2020 was undertaken after the introduction of specific peri operative COVID safety measures across Greater Manchester cancer surgical cells. The COVID related outcomes for all cancer patients operated on in Greater Manchester were recorded.

ResultsOf the 1501 patients undergoing surgery, one (<0.1%) was diagnosed with COVID-19 in hospital within 14 days of surgery. This patient did not require admission to critical care due to post-operative COVID-19 diagnosis, and there was no associated mortality related to post-operative COVID-19 infection.

ConclusionThe use of peri operative COVID-19 infection prevention strategies has allowed for the safe continuation of elective cancer surgery during this pandemic in all surgical units, without significant additional COVID-19 related morbidity or mortality.",David Shackley; Struan Henry Gray; Susannah Penney; Lisa Galligan-Dawson; Freya Howle; Sanjay Arya; John Hunter; Francis Andrews; Colin Wasson; Murray Luckas; Brendan Ryan; Jane Eddleston; Chris Brookes; Christopher Harrison,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20207803,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20207803,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
261,Effective Deep Learning Approaches for Predicting COVID-19 Outcomes from Chest Computed Tomography Volumes,"The rapid evolution of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in an urgent need for effective clinical tools to reduce transmission and manage severe illness. Numerous teams are quickly developing artificial intelligence approaches to these problems, including using deep learning to predict COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis from computed tomography (CT) imaging data. In this work, we assess the value of aggregated chest CT data for COVID-19 prognosis compared to clinical metadata alone. We develop a novel patient-level algorithm to aggregate the chest CT volume into a 2D representation that can be easily integrated with clinical metadata to distinguish Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19+) from other cases of viral pneumonia and normal healthy chest CT volumes with state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we present a multitask model for joint segmentation of different classes of pulmonary lesions present in COVID-19 infected lungs that can outperform individual segmentation models for each task. We directly compare this multitask segmentation approach to combining feature-agnostic volumetric CT classification feature maps with clinical metadata for predicting mortality. These approaches enable the automated extraction of clinically relevant features from chest CT volumes for risk stratification of COVID-19+ patients.",Anusua Trivedi; Anthony Ortiz; Jocelyn Desbiens; Caleb Robinson; Marian Blazes; Sunil Gupta; Rahul Dodhia; Pavan Bhatraju; W.

262,Correlation between Chest CT Severity Scores and the Clinical Parameters of Adult Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,"PurposeOur aim is to correlate the clinical condition of patients with COVID-19 infection with the 25 Point CT severity score by Chang et al (devised for assessment of ARDS in patients with SARS in 2005).

Material and MethodsData of consecutive symptomatic patients who were suspected to have COVID-19 infection and presented to our hospital, was collected from March to April 2020. All patients underwent two consecutive RT-PCR tests and had a non-contrast HRCT scan done at presentation. From the original cohort of 1062 patients, 160 patients were excluded leaving a total number of 902 patients.

ResultsThe mean age was 44.2 {+/-}11.9 years [85.3%males, 14.7%females]. CT severity score found to be positively correlated with lymphopenia, increased serum CRP, d-dimer and ferritin levels (p < 0.0001). The oxygen requirements as well as length of hospital stay were increasing with the increase of scan severity.

ConclusionThe 25-point CT severity score correlates well with the COVID-19 clinical severity. Our data suggest that chest CT scoring system can aid in predicting COVID-19 disease outcome and significantly correlates with lab tests and oxygen requirements.",Ghufran Saeed; Waqar Gaba; Asad Shah; Abeer Al Helali; Emadullah Raidullah; Ameirah Al Ali; Mohammed Elghazali; Deena Ahmed; Shaikha Al Kaabi; Safaa Almazrouei,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213058,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213058,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
263,Correlation of COVID-19 Mortality with Clinical Parameters in an Urban and Suburban Nursing Home Population,"Importance and ObjectiveCOVID-19 has a high mortality rate amongst nursing home populations (26.4% nationally and 28.3% in New Jersey). Identification of factors influencing mortality in COVID-19 positive nursing home populations may help direct physicians towards appropriate glycemic, blood pressure, weight, kidney function, lipid, thyroid, and hematologic management to reduce COVID-19 mortality.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRetrospective cross-sectional study of patients in two nursing home facilities (one urban, one suburban) from 3/16/2020 to 7/13/2020 with positive COVID-19 PCR assays. Age, race, sex, lipids, hematologic parameters, body mass index, blood pressure, thyroid function, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin A1c were correlated with COVID-19 mortality by chi-squared analysis.

Main Outcome and Results56 patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. Mortality was 14.3% while the New Jersey nursing home average mortality rate was 28.3% as of August 2020. Our patient cohort had a 49.5% reduction in mortality compared to the state average.

In our overall cohort, none of the clinical parameters correlated with COVID-19 mortality using chi-squared analysis. In the 56 patient cohort, average clinical and laboratory findings were 74.0 years, 62.5% female, 28.5% uncontrolled hypertension, BMI 25.6, hemoglobin A1c 6.4, TSH 2.4, vitamin B12 568.3, folate 12.4, iron 47.8, total iron binding capacity 271.8, hemoglobin 11.6, albumin 3.5, triglycerides 100.3, total cholesterol 133.5, HDL 40.9, and BUN to Creatinine ratio 22.2:1. Logistic multivariate regression analyses failed to demonstrate clinically significant correlation with COVID-19 mortality.

In the urban nursing home, BUN to creatinine ratio exceeding 20:1 was the only factor that showed statistical significance to COVID-19 mortality (p = 0.03). In the suburban nursing home, age over 80 was the only clinical factor demonstrating statistical significance to COVID-19 mortality (p = 0.003).

Conclusions and RelevanceIn our COVID-19 positive nursing home patients, no one parameter was clinically significant in the overall 56-patient cohort; however, mortality in our population was 14.3% compared to New Jerseys 28.3%, a 49.5% reduction in mortality. Rigorous control of the aforementioned clinical parameters may have contributed to this reduction in mortality. Further research requires analysis of more nursing home patients to determine whether rigorous control of clinical parameters decreases mortality from COVID-19.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat clinical parameters lead to a lower mortality rate in nursing home patients with COVID-19?

FindingsIn this cross-sectional analysis of 56 SARS-CoV-2 positive New Jersey nursing home residents from March to July 2020, controlling hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, hematologic and lipid panels to recommended levels yielded a mortality rate of 14.3%, a 49.5% reduction from the 28.3% mortality rate of COVID-19 in New Jersey nursing homes.

264,Risks and Benefits of Antibiotics vs. COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality,"ObjectivesThe purpose is to analyze the potential association of each antibiotic consumption rate and use ratio with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and to investigate the efficacy and safe use of antibiotics against COVID-19.

DesignRetrospective statistical analysis study of antibiotic use compared with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

MethodsEach antibiotic defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day as each antibiotic consumption rate was available in the official reports and each antibacterial use ratio data was calculated from them. Coronavirus Disease data were obtained from the WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard. The relationships between the sum of DDD, each antibacterial DDD, each antibiotic use ratio, and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality were examined. The statistical correlation was calculated by univariate linear regression analysis and expressed by Pearsons correlation coefficient.

ResultsThe sum of DDD had no statistical correlation with mortality and morbidity. Cephalosporins were a negative correlation with them. Penicillins had a weak positive correlation with them. Macrolides, quinolones, and sulfonates showed a slightly negative correlation tendency with mortality.

ConclusionsCephalosporins may affect less COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Penicillins suggest to accelerate them. The combination of cephalosporins with macrolides or quinolones may be a helpful treatment. The difference in antibiotic use between Japan and EU/EEA countries will suggest an explanation for the reduction in morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19.",Hisaya Tanioka; Sayaka Tanioka,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213603,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213603,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
265,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Suicide and Self Harm among Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department of a Teaching Hospital in Nepal,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge that is not just limited to the physical consequences but also a significant degree of a mental health crisis. Self-harm (SH) and suicide are its extreme effects. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence and clinical profile of suicide and SH in our ED.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the ED of a tertiary care center. Records of all fatal and nonfatal SH patients presenting to the ED during the lockdown period (March 24-June 23, 2020; Period1), matching periods in the previous year (March 24-June 23,2019; Period 2) and 3 months period prior (December 24 2019-March 23, 2020; Period 3) was included by searching the electronic medical record (EMR) system. The prevalence and the clinical profile of the patients were compared between these three periods.

ResultsA total of 125 (periods 1=55, 2=38, and 3=32) suicide and SH cases were analyzed. The cases of suicide/SH had increased by 44% and 71.9% during the lockdown period in comparison to the period 2 and 3. Organophosphate poisoning was the most common mode. Females were predominant in all three periods with a mean age of 32 (95%CI: 29.3-34.7). There was a significant delay in arrival of the patients in period 1 (p-value=0.045) with increased hospital admission (p-value =0.009) and in-hospital mortality (18.2% vs 2.6 % and 3.1%) (p-value=.001).

ConclusionWe found an increase in patients presenting with suicide and SH in our ED during the pandemic which is likely to reflect an increased prevalence of mental illness in the community. We hope that the result will prime all mental health care stakeholders to initiate mental health screening and intervention for the vulnerable population during this period of crisis.",Roshana Shrestha; Shisir Siwakoti; Saumya Singh; Anmol Purna Shrestha,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213769,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213769,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
266,Guiding Austria through the COVID-19 Epidemics with a Forecast-Based Early Warning System,"BackgroundThe corona crisis hit Austria at the end of February 2020 with one of the first European superspreading events. In response, the governmental crisis unit commissioned a forecast consortium with regularly projections of case numbers and demand for hospital beds.

MethodsWe consolidated the output of three independent epidemiological models (ranging from agent-based micro simulation to parsimonious compartmental models) and published weekly short-term forecasts for the number of confirmed cases as well as estimates and upper bounds for the required hospital beds.

FindingsHere, we report om four key contributions by which our forecasting and reporting system has helped shaping Austrias policy to navigate the crisis and re-open the country step-wise, namely (i) when and where case numbers are expected to peak during the first wave, (ii) how to safely re-open the country after passing this peak, (iii) how to evaluate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and (iv) provide hospital managers guidance to plan health-care capacities.

InterpretationComplex mathematical epidemiological models play an important role in guiding governmental responses during pandemic crises, provided they are used as a monitoring system to detect epidemiological change points. For policy-makers, the media and the public, it might be problematic to distinguish short-term forecasts from worst-case scenarios with undefined levels of certainty, creating distrust in the legitimacy and accuracy of such models. However, when used as a short-term forecast-based monitoring system, the models can inform decisions to ease or strengthen governmental responses.",Martin Bicher; Martin Zuba; Lukas Rainer; Florian Bachner; Claire Rippinger; Herwig Ostermann; Nikolas Popper; Stefan Thurner; Peter Klimek,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214767,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214767,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
267,"Lessons from applied large-scale pooling of 133,816 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests","Pooling multiple swab samples prior to RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis was proposed as a strategy to reduce costs and increase throughput of SARS-CoV-2 tests. However, reports on practical large-scale group testing for SARS-CoV-2 have been scant. Key open questions concern reduced sensitivity due to sample dilution; the rate of false positives; the actual efficiency (number of tests saved by pooling) and the impact of infection rate in the population on assay performance. Here we report analysis of 133,816 samples collected at April-September 2020, tested by pooling for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We spared 76% of RNA extraction and RT-PCR tests, despite the reality of frequently changing prevalence rate (0.5%-6%). Surprisingly, we observed pooling efficiency and sensitivity that exceed theoretical predictions, which resulted from non-random distribution of positive samples in pools.

268,Temporal course of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity in patients with COVID-19 following the first clinical presentation,"Knowledge of the sensitivities of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody tests beyond 35 days after the clinical onset of COVID-19 is insufficient. We aimed to describe positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 assays employing three different measurement principles over a prolonged period. Two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test followed by serological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were included.. We conducted three chemiluminescence (including electrochemiluminscence, ECLIA), four enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test formats. Positivity rates, as well as positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated for each week after the first clinical presentation for COVID-19. Furthermore, combinations of tests were assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays and predictive values were calculated. Heat maps were constructed to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence assays and one ELISA IgG test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. With the exception of ECLIA, the PPVs of the other chemiluminescence assays were [&ge;]95% for COVID-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA had somewhat lower PPVs. IgM exhibited insufficient predictive characteristics. An orthogonal testing approach provided PPVs [&ge;]95% for patients with a moderate pretest probability (e.g., symptomatic patients), even for tests with a low single test performance. After the second week, NPVs of all but IgM assays were [&ge;]95% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability. The confirmation of negative results using an orthogonal algorithm with another assay provided lower NPVs than the single assays. When interpreting results from SARS-CoV-2 tests, the pretest probability, time of blood draw and assay characteristics must be carefully considered. An orthogonal testing approach increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions.",Martin Risch; Myriam Weber; Sarah Thiel; Kirsten Grossmann; Nadia Wohlwend; Thomas Risch; Dorothea Hillmann; Michael Ritzler; Francesca Ferrara; Susanna Bigler; Konrad Egli; Thomas Bodmer; Mauro Imperiali; Yacir Salimi; Felix Fleisch; Alexia Cusini; Harald Renz; Philipp Kohler; Pietro Vernazza; Christian R Kahlert; Matthias Paprotny; Lorenz Risch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214445,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214445,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
269,Biomimetic Virus-like Particles as SARS-CoV-2 Positive Controls for RT-PCR Diagnostics,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible disease that has affected more than 90% of the countries worldwide. At least 17 million individuals have been infected, and some countries are still battling first or second waves of the pandemic. Nucleic acid tests, especially reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), have become the workhorse for early detection of COVID-19 infection. Positive controls for the molecular assays have been developed to validate each test and to provide high accuracy. However, most available positive controls require cold-chain distribution and cannot serve as full-process control. To overcome these shortcomings, we report the production of biomimetic virus-like particles (VLPs) as SARS-CoV-2 positive controls. A SARS-CoV-2 detection module for RT-PCR was encapsidated into VLPs from a bacteriophage and a plant virus. The chimeric VLPs were obtained either by in vivo reconstitution and co-expression of the target detection module and coat proteins or by in vitro assembly of purified detection module RNA sequences and coat proteins. These VLP-based positive controls mimic SARS-CoV-2 packaged RNA while being non-infectious. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the positive controls are scalable, stable, and can serve broadly as controls, from RNA extraction to PCR in clinical settings.

270,Association between live childhood vaccines and COVID-19 outcomes: a national-level analysis,"We investigated whether countries with higher coverage of childhood live vaccines [BCG or measles-containing-vaccine (MCV)] have reduced risk of COVID-19 related mortality, accounting for known systems differences between countries. In this ecological study of 140 countries using publicly available national-level data, higher vaccine coverage, representing estimated proportion of people vaccinated during the last 15 years, was associated with lower COVID-19 deaths. The associations attenuated for both vaccine variables, and MCV coverage became no longer significant once adjusted for a validated summary score accounting for life expectancy and healthcare quality indicators, the Healthcare access and quality index (HAQI). The magnitude of association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 death rate varied according to HAQI, and MCV coverage had little effect on the association between BCG and COVID-19 deaths. While there are associations between live vaccine coverage and COVID-19 outcomes, the vaccine coverage variables themselves were strongly correlated with COVID-19 testing rate, HAQI, and life expectancy. This suggests that the population-level associations may be further confounded by differences in structural health systems and policies.

272,A Study on the Effects of Containment Policies and Vaccination on the Spread of SARS-CoV-2,"This paper presents a method to predict the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in a population with a known age-structure, and then, to quantify the effects of various containment policies, including those policies that affect each age-group differently. The model itself is a compartmental model in which each compartment is divided into a number of age-groups. The parameter of the model are estimated using an optimisation scheme and some known results from the theory of monotone systems such that the model output agrees with some collected data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

To highlight the strengths of this framework, a few case studies are presented in which different populations are subjected to different containment strategies. They include cases in which the containment policies switch between scenarios with different levels of severity. Then a case study on herd immunity due to vaccination is presented. And then it is shown how we can use this framework to optimality distribute a limited number of vaccine units in a given population to maximise their impact and lower the total number of infectious individuals.

273,Echo chambers as early warning signals of widespread vaccine refusal in social-epidemiological networks,"Sudden shifts in population health and vaccination rates occur as the dynamics of some epidemiological models go through a critical point; literature shows that this is sometimes foreshadowed by early warning signals (EWS). We investigate different structural measures of a network as candidate EWS of infectious disease outbreaks and changes in popular vaccine sentiment. We construct a multiplex disease model coupling infectious disease spread and social contact dynamics. We find that the number and mean size of echo chambers predict transitions in the infection dynamics, as do opinion-based communities. Graph modularity also gives early warnings, though the clustering coefficient shows no significant pre-outbreak changes. Change point tests applied to the EWS show decreasing efficacy as social norms strengthen. Therefore, many measures of social network connectivity can predict approaching critical changes in vaccine uptake and aggregate health, thereby providing valuable tools for improving public health.",Brendon C Phillips; Chris Bauch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214312,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214312,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
274,"Quantifying Asymptomatic Infection and Transmission of COVID-19 in New York City using Observed Cases, Serology and Testing Capacity","The contributions of asymptomatic infections to herd immunity and community transmission are key to the resurgence and control of COVID-19, but are difficult to estimate using current models that ignore changes in testing capacity. Using a model that incorporates daily testing information fit to the case and serology data from New York City, we show that the proportion of symptomatic cases is low, ranging from 13% to 18%, and that the reproductive number may be larger than often assumed. Asymptomatic infections contribute substantially to herd immunity, and to community transmission together with pre-symptomatic ones. If asymptomatic infections transmit at similar rates than symptomatic ones, the overall reproductive number across all classes is larger than often assumed, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. If they transmit poorly, then symptomatic cases have a larger reproductive number ranging from 3.9 to 8.1. Even in this regime, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases together comprise at least 50% of the force of infection at the outbreak peak. We find no regimes in which all infection sub-populations have reproductive numbers lower than 3. These findings elucidate the uncertainty that current case and serology data cannot resolve, despite consideration of different model structures. They also emphasize how temporal data on testing can reduce and better define this uncertainty, as we move forward through longer surveillance and second epidemic waves. Complementary information is required to determine the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases, which we discuss. Regardless, current assumptions about the basic reproductive number of SARS-Cov-2 should be reconsidered.

Significance StatementAs health officials face another wave of COVID-19, they require estimates of the proportion of infected cases that develop symptoms, and the extent to which symptomatic and asymptomatic cases contribute to community transmission. Recent asymptomatic testing guidelines are ambiguous. Using an epidemiological model that includes testing capacity, we show that most infections are asymptomatic but contribute substantially to community transmission in the aggregate. Their individual transmissibility remains uncertain. If they transmit as well as symptomatic infections, the epidemic may spread at faster rates than current models often assume. If they do not, then each symptomatic case generates on average a higher number of secondary infections than typically assumed. Regardless, controlling transmission requires community-wide interventions informed by extensive, well-documented asymptomatic testing.",Rahul Subramanian; Qixin He; Mercedes Pascual,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20214049,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20214049,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
275,"Monitoring for outbreak associated excess mortality in an African city: Detection limits in Antananarivo, Madagascar","Quantitative estimates of the impact of infectious disease outbreaks are required to develop measured policy responses. In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers. Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be to be detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo in Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak. The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 154% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detecting anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in the capital of Madagascar. Given current age-specific estimates of the COVID-19 fatality ratio and the age structure of the population in Antananarivo, we estimate that as few as 11 deaths per week in the 60-70 years age group (corresponding to an infection rate of approximately 1%) would detectably exceed the baseline.

277,Why do per capita COVID-19 Case Rates Differ Between U.S. States?,"BackgroundThe popular press has explored the differences among U.S. states in rates of COVID-19 cases, mostly focusing on political party differences, and often mentioning that political party differences in health outcomes are confounded by demographic and socio-economic differences between Democratic areas and Republican areas. The purpose of this paper is to present a thorough analysis of these issues.

Design and Methods: State-specific COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people was the main outcome studied, with explanatory variables from Bureau of Census surveys, including percentages of the state population that were Hispanic, black, below poverty level, had at least a bachelors degree, or were uninsured, along with median age, median income, population density, and degree of urbanization. We also included political party in power as an explanatory variable in multiple linear regression. The units of analysis in this study are the 50 U.S. states.

ResultsAll explanatory variables were at least marginally statistically significantly associated with case rate in univariate regression analysis, except for population density and urbanization. All the census characteristics were at least marginally associated with party in power in one factor analysis of variance, except for percentage black. In a forward stepwise procedure in a multivariable model for case rate, percentages of the state population that were Hispanic or black, median age, median income, population density, and (residual) percentage poverty were retained as statistically significant and explained 62% of the variation between states in case rates. In a model with political party in power included, along with any additional variables that notably affected the adjusted association between party in power and case rate, 69% of the variance between states in case rates was explained, and adjusted case rates per 100,000 people were 2155 for states with Democratic governments, 2269 for states with mixed governments, and 2738 for Republican-led states. These estimates are based on data through October 8, 2020.

ConclusionsU.S. state-specific demographic and socio-economic variables are strongly associated with the states COVID-19 case rates, so must be considered in analysis of variation in case rates between the states. Adjusting for these factors, states with Democrats as the party in power have lower case rates than Republican-led states.",Lloyd Chambless,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213892,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213892,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
278,Statistical deconvolution for inference of infection time series,"Accurate measurement of daily infection incidence is crucial to epidemic response. However, delays in symptom onset, testing, and reporting obscure the dynamics of transmission, necessitating methods to remove the effects of stochastic delays from observed data. Existing estimators can be sensitive to model misspecification and censored observations; many analysts have instead used methods that exhibit strong bias or do not account for delays. We develop an estimator with a regularization scheme to cope with these sources of noise, which we term the Robust Incidence Deconvolution Estimator (RIDE). We validate RIDE on synthetic data, comparing accuracy and stability to existing approaches. We then use RIDE to study COVID-19 records in the United States, and find evidence that infection estimates from reported cases can be more informative than estimates from mortality data. To implement these methods, we release incidental, a ready-to-use R implementation of our estimator that can aid ongoing efforts to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic.",Andrew C Miller; Lauren Hannah; Joseph Futoma; Nicholas J Foti; Emily B Fox; Alexander D'Amour; Mark Sandler; Rif A Saurous; Joseph Lewnard,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20212753,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20212753,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True

AimThe aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on childrens and adolescents mental health in Greece.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 1,232 Greek parents of children and adolescents aged < 18 years was conducted in March and May 2020. Parents provided information about sociodemographic characteristics, family everyday life during the lockdown and the pandemic psychological impact on their children.

ResultsApproximately one-third (35.1%) of parents reported that the psychological health of their children was considerably affected. The most significant concern was social isolation. Unemployment, increased family conflicts, no opportunity for tele-work and a deteriorating psychological health of the parent, as well as childrens previous history of physical health conditions were all significantly associated with adverse mental health impact.

280,The implications of religious event and holidays on the transmission of SARS-CoV2 : the impact of behavioral changes on transmission,"IntroductionThe risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV2 have been widely studied and it was evident that a populations behavior has a direct effect on the risk of transmission. Public health measures and regulation are largely kept to control and direct these behaviors. In this study, we describe the change in transmission in SARS-CoV2 in relation to demographics before and after two major religious events: ""Eid Alfitr"" and ""Ashura""

MethodsThis is a national observational study conducted in Bahrain in September 2020 to compare the number and demographics of all newly diagnosed cases before and after Eid Alfitr (religious holiday) and Ashura religious event. A 10 day period before the event was compared to a 10 day period after the event by ten days. Data on the number of tests, number of new cases, their demographics (age, gender, nationality) and presence of symptoms were collected and analyzed.

ResultsThere was significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases after both Eid Alfitr (1997 more cases, with a 67% increase) and Ashura (4232 more cases with 2.19 times more cases). The majority of new cases after the religious events were found in local Bahrainis, from 472 cases to 2169 cases after Eid, and from 2201 to 6639 cases after Ashura. The rise was most notable in females (increased by 4.89 times after Eid and by 2.69 times after Ashura), children (increased by 4.69 times after Eid and by 5 times after Ashura) and elderly above the age of 60 years (increased by 5.7 times after Eid and by 3.23 times after Ashura).

ConclusionIt is evident that religious events and holidays have important implications on the transmission of SARS-CoV2. This increased in transmission is related mainly to the behavior of the population in those days. Children, female, and elderly were the most affected categories due to these events. A thorough public health plan to limit the spread of the infection at these events should be planned and implemented ahead of time.",Abdulkarim Abdulrahman; Abdulla Ismael AlAwadhi; Muath Almajthoob; Manaf AlQahtani,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214056,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.17.20214056,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
281,COVID-19 IN CHILDREN WITH RHEUMATIC DISEASES (RD) IN THE SPANISH NATIONAL COHORT EPICO-AEP.,"ObjectivesSARS-CoV-2 infection in adults with rheumatic diseases (RD) is a cause for concern. Data in the pediatric population are practically absent. We aimed to describe the prevalence of patients with RD and their complications among children admitted with COVID-19 in the Spanish national cohort EPICO-AEP; a multicenter prospective national study.

MethodsChildren <18 years old with RD and COVID-19 enrolled in EPICO-AEP were included in this study.

ResultsBy June 30th 2020, 350 children were admitted in secondary and tertiary hospitals of Spain with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 8 patients presented RD (2.2% of those hospitalized). All were female. The median age was 12.1 years (IQR 8.3-14.5). The diagnosis related with COVID-19 were febrile syndrome and/or upper respiratory infection (4 cases) and pneumonia (4 cases). One of the 8 (12.5%) patients with a severe juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) with interstitial lung disease died. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was the most frequent diagnosis in 3/8 (37.5%) patients. In 5/8 (62.5%) cases, the RD was not fully controlled, and all patients except one received corticosteroid treatment.

ConclusionsChildren with RD have accounted for 2.2% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our series. The evolution has been moderately favorable, with one deceased. In case of active disease and use of corticosteroids patients should be managed with caution.

What is already known about this subject?O_LIStudies in adults with rheumatic disesases (RD) show that immune-mediated inflammatory disease and use of biologics are not associated with worse COVID-19.
C_LIO_LIPoorly controlled active RD or some treatments such as corticosteroids, may have an increased risk of infection and serious disease in adults. No data in children.

282,Structural and metabolic brain abnormalities in COVID-19 patients with sudden loss of smell,"ObjectivesSudden loss of smell is a very common symptom of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). This study characterizes the structural and metabolic cerebral correlates of dysosmia in patients with COVID-19.

MethodsStructural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) were prospectively acquired simultaneously on a hybrid PET-MR in twelve patients (2 males, 10 females, mean age: 42.6 years, age range: 23-60 years) with sudden dysosmia and positive detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on nasopharyngeal swab specimens. FDG-PET data were analysed using a voxel-based approach and compared with that of a group of healthy subjects.

ResultsBilateral blocking of the olfactory cleft was observed in six patients, while subtle olfactory bulb asymmetry was found in three patients. No MRI signal abnormality downstream of the olfactory tract was observed. Heterogeneous (decrease or increase) glucose metabolism abnormalities were observed in core olfactory and high-order neocortical areas. A modulation of regional cerebral glucose metabolism by the severity and the duration of COVID-19-related dysosmia was disclosed using correlation analyses.

ConclusionsThis PET-MR study shows that sudden loss of smell in COVID-19 is not related to central involvement due to SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasiveness. Loss of smell is associated with heterogeneous cerebral metabolic changes in core olfactory and high-order cortical areas likely related to combined processes of deafferentation and active functional reorganisation secondary to the lack of olfactory stimulation.",Maxime Niesen; Nicola Trotta; Antoine Noel; Tim Coolen; Georges Fayad; Gil Leurkin-Sterk; Isabelle Delpierre; Sophie Henrard; Niloufar Sadeghi; Jean-Christophe Goffard; Serge Goldman; Xavier De Tiège,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214221,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214221,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True

ObjectiveIn this study, we evaluated the infection rate and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)

MethodsOne thousand and three hundred and sixty one MS patients from Fars province, south of Iran, were interviewed by phone from April 3 to June 20, 2020. Basic demographic data, information about MS disease and any symptoms or laboratory results relevant to COVID-19 were gathered and reviewed by treating neurologist and MS nurses. SPSS version 22 was used for data analysis.

Results68 (5%) of MS patients were suspected cases and 8 (0.58%) of all patients with positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or chest CT were in the confirmed group. 5 cases of the confirmed group needed hospitalization. Two patients died while both of them had PPMS and were taking rituximab. The frequency rate of suspected cases with RRMS was 57 (87.7%), followed by PPMS 5 (7.7%) and CIS 2(3.1%). In the confirmed group 37.5% had RRMS, 50% had PPMS, 25% use corticosteroid drug, and 50% were on rituximab. 62.5% of confirmed cases had high disability level and need assistance to walk. 36.8% of suspected and 25% of the confirmed cases were on IFN-{beta}1; eventually all of them recovered well from COVID-19 infection.

To date, most studies have focused on the mental health consequences of the lockdown measures, while studies assessing how this disease control measure influences the occurrence of fatigue are largely absent.

AimThe aims of this study are two-fold: (a) to examine the levels of lockdown fatigue, and (2) to determine the role of coping behaviours, personal resilience, psychological well-being and perceived health in fatigue associated to the lockdown measure.

MethodsThis is an online cross-sectional study involving 243 college students in the Central Philippines during the sixth month of the lockdown measure implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Five standardised scales were used to collect the data.

ResultsOverall, college students reported moderate levels of lockdown fatigue, with a mean score of 31.54 (out of 50). Physical exhaustion or tiredness, headaches and body pain, decreased motivation and increased worry were the most pronounced manifestations of fatigue reported. Gender and college year were identified as important predictors of fatigue. Increased personal resilience and coping skills were associated with lower levels of lockdown fatigue.

ConclusionCollege students experience moderate levels of fatigue during the mandatory lockdown or home confinement period. Resilient students and those who perceive higher social support experience lower levels of fatigue during the lockdown period compared to students with low resilience and social support. Lockdown fatigue may be addressed by formulating and implementing interventions to enhance personal resilience and social support among college students.",Leodoro Labrague; Cherry Ann Ballad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20213942,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20213942,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
285,PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF CORONAPHOBIA AMONG FRONTLINE HOSPITAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES,"ObjectivesTo determine the prevalence rate as well as the predictors of coronaphobia in frontline hospital and public health nurses.

DesignThis study used a cross-sectional research study involving 736 nurses working in COVID-19 designated hospitals and health units in Region 8, Philippines. Four structured self-report scales were used, including the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire, and the single-item measure for perceived health.

ResultsThe prevalence rate of coronaphobia was 54.76% (n = 402): 37.04% (n = 130) in hospital nurses and 70.91% (n = 273) in public health nurses. Additionally, nurses gender ({beta} = 0.146, p = 0.001), marital status ({beta} = 0.101, p = 0.009), job status ({beta} = 0.132, p = 0.001), and personal resilience ({beta} = -0.154, p = 0.005) were identified as predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. A small proportion of nurses was willing (19.94%, n = 70) and fully prepared (9.40%, n = 33) to manage and care for coronavirus patients.

286,2008 financial crisis vs 2020 economic fallout: How COVID-19 might influence fertility treatment and live births,"BackgroundThe economic and reproductive medicine response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has reduced the affordability and accessibility of fertility care. We sought to determine the impact of the 2008 financial recession and the COVID-19 recession on fertility treatments and cumulative live-births.

MethodsWe examined annual US natality, CDC IVF cycle activity and live birth data from 1999 to 2018 encompassing 3,286,349 treatment cycles, to estimate the age-stratified reduction in IVF cycles undertaken after the 2008 financial recession, with forward quantitative modelling of IVF cycle activity and cumulative live-births for 2020 to 2023.

ResultsThe financial recession of 2008 caused a four-year plateau in fertility treatments with a predicted 53,026 (95% CI 49,581 to 56,471) fewer IVF cycles and 16,872 (95% CI 16,713 to 17,031) fewer live births. A similar scale of economic recession would cause 67,386 (95% CI: 61,686 to 73,086) fewer IVF cycles between 2020 and 2023, with women younger than 35 years overall undertaking 22,504 (95% CI 14,320 to 30,690) fewer cycles, as compared to 4,445 (95% CI 3,144 to 5749) fewer cycles in women over the age of 40 years. This equates to overall 25,143 (95% CI: 22,408 to 27,877) fewer predicted live-births from IVF, of which only 490 (95% CI 381 to 601) are anticipated to occur in women over the age of 40 years.

287,Age-Stratified SARS-CoV-2 Infection Fatality Rates in New York City estimated from serological data,"ImportanceCOVID-19 has killed hundreds of thousands of people in the US and >1 million globally. Estimating the age-specific infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 for different populations is crucial for assessing the fatality of COVID-19 and for appropriately allocating limited vaccine supplies to minimize mortality.

ObjectiveTo estimate IFRs for COVID-19 in New York City and compare them to IFRs from other countries.

Design, Setting, ParticipantsWe used data from a published serosurvey of 5946 individuals 18 years or older conducted April 19-28, 2020 with time series of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths for five age-classes from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. We inferred age-specific IFRs using a Bayesian framework that accounted for the distribution of delay between infection and seroconversion and infection and death.

Main Outcome and MeasureInfection fatality rate.

ResultsWe found that IFRs increased approximately 77-fold with age, with a nearly linear increase on a log scale, from 0.07% (0.055%-0.086%) in 18-44 year olds to 5.4% (4.3%-6.3%) in individuals 75 and older. New York City IFRs were higher for 18-44 year olds and 45-64 year olds (0.58%; 0.45%-0.75%) than Spanish, English, and Swiss populations, but IFRs for 75+ year olds were lower than for English populations and similar to Spanish and Swiss populations.

Conclusions and RelevanceThese results suggest that the age-specific fatality of COVID-19 differs among developed countries and raises questions about factors underlying these differences.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow do age-specific infection fatality rates (IFR) for COVID-19 in the U.S. compare to other populations?

FindingsWe estimated age-specific IFRs of SARS-CoV-2 using seroprevalence data and deaths in New York City. IFRs increased more than 75-fold with age, from 0.07% in 18-45 year olds to 5.3% in individuals over 75. IFRs in New York City were higher than IFRs in England, Geneva, France and Spain for individuals younger than 64 years old, but similar for older individuals.

288,Composition of the immunoglobulin G glycome associates with the severity of COVID-19,"A large variation in the severity of disease symptoms is one of the key open questions in COVID-19 pandemics. The fact that only a small subset of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe disease suggests that there have to be some predisposing factors, but biomarkers that reliably predict disease severity have not been found so far. Since overactivation of the immune system is implicated in a severe form of COVID-19 and the IgG glycosylation is known to be involved in the regulation of different immune processes, we evaluated the association of inter-individual variation in IgG N-glycome composition with the severity of COVID-19. The analysis of 166 severe and 167 mild cases from hospitals in Spain, Italy and Portugal revealed statistically significant differences in the composition of the IgG N-glycome. The most notable difference was the decrease in bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in severe patients from all three cohorts. IgG galactosylation was also lower in severe cases in all cohorts, but the difference in galactosylation was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.

289,Face masks to prevent transmission of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundBased on the current status of the COVID-19 global pandemic, there is an urgent need to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of wearing masks to protect public health from COVID-19 infection.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of using face masks to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chinese) database. There were no language restrictions. This study was registered with PROSPERO under the number CRD42020211862.

ResultsA total of 6 case-control studies were included. In general, wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.21-0.69, I2 = 54.1%). Heterogeneity modifiers were investigated by subgroup analysis. For healthcare workers group, masks were shown to have a reduce risk of infection by nearly 70%. Studies in China showed a higher protective effect than other countries. Adjusted estimates and subgroup analyses showed similar findings.

290,CLINICAL COURSE AND OUTCOME OF COVID-19 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: DATA FROM A NATIONAL REPOSITORY,"BackgroundMortality attributable to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) 2 infection occurs mainly through the development of viral pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Research QuestionThe objective of the study is to delineate the clinical profile, predictors of disease progression, and 30-day mortality from ARDS using the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse.

Study Design and MethodsAnalysis of a historical cohort of 7,816 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between January 1, 2020, and August 1, 2020. Main outcomes were progression to ARDS and 30-day mortality from ARDS, respectively.

ResultsThe cohort was comprised predominantly of men (94.5%) with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60-74 years). 2,184 (28%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 643 (29.4%) were diagnosed with ARDS. The median Charlson Index was 3 (IQR 1-5). Independent predictors of progression to ARDS were body mass index (BMI)[&ge;] 40 kg/m2, diabetes, lymphocyte counts<700x109/L, LDH>450 U/L, ferritin >862 ng/ml, C-reactive protein >11 mg/dL, and D-dimer >1.5 ug/ml. In contrast, the use of an anticoagulant lowered the risk of developing ARDS (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.49-0.89]. Crude 30-day mortality rate from ARDS was 41% (95% CI 38%-45%). Risk of death from ARDS was significantly higher in those who developed acute renal failure and septic shock. Use of an anticoagulant was associated with two-fold reduction in mortality. Survival benefit was observed in patients who received corticosteroids and/or remdesivir but there was no advantage of combination therapy over either agent alone.

ConclusionsAmong those hospitalized for COVID-19, nearly one in ten progressed to ARDS. Septic shock, and acute renal failure are the leading causes of death in these patients. Treatment with either remdesivir and corticosteroids reduced the risk of mortality from ARDS. All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should be placed at a minimum on prophylactic doses of anticoagulation.",Ali A El Solh; Gianfranco Umberto Meduri; Yolanda Lawson; MIchael Carter; Kari A Mergenhagen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20214130,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20214130,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
291,Suicide Deaths during the Stay-at-Home Advisory in Massachusetts.,"Many believe that shelter-in-place or stay-at-home policies might cause an increase in so-called deaths of despair. While increases in psychiatric stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic are anticipated, whether suicide rates changed during stay-at-home periods has not been described.

This was an observational cohort study that assembled suicide death data for persons aged 10 years or older from the Massachusetts Department of Health Registry of Vital Records and Statistics from January 2015 through May 2020. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA to analyze suicide deaths in Massachusetts, we compared the observed number of suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home period (March through May, 2020) in Massachusetts to the projected number of expected deaths. To be conservative, we also accounted for the deaths still pending final cause determination

The incident rate for suicide deaths in Massachusetts was 0.67 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.56-0.79) versus 0.81 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.69-0.94) during the 2019 corresponding period (incident rate ratio of 0.83; 95% CI 0.66-1.03). The addition of the 57 deaths pending cause determination occurring from March through May 2020 and the 33 cases still pending determination from the 2019 corresponding period did not change these findings.

The observed number of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home period did not deviate from ARIMA projected expectations using either preliminary data or an alternate scenario in which deaths pending investigation (exceeding the average remaining number of deaths still pending investigation which occurred during the corresponding 2015-2019 period) were ascribed to suicide. Decedent age and sex demographics were unchanged during the pandemic period compared to 2015-2019.

The stable rates of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home advisory in Massachusetts parallel findings following ecological disasters. As the pandemic persists, uncertainty about its scope and economic impact may increase. However, our data are reassuring that an increase in suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home advisory period did not occur.",Jeremy Faust; Sejal B Shah; Chengan Du; Shu-Xia Li; Zhenqiu Lin; Harlan M Krumholz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215343,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215343,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
292,Real-time tracking and prediction of COVID-19 infection using digital proxies of population mobility and mixing,"Digital proxies of human mobility and physical mixing have been used to monitor viral transmissibility and effectiveness of social distancing interventions in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a new framework that parameterizes disease transmission models with age-specific digital mobility data. By fitting the model to case data in Hong Kong, we were able to accurately track the local effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in near real time (i.e. no longer constrained by the delay of around 9 days between infection and reporting of cases) which is essential for quick assessment of the effectiveness of interventions on reducing transmissibility. Our findings showed that accurate nowcast and forecast of COVID-19 epidemics can be obtained by integrating valid digital proxies of physical mixing into conventional epidemic models.",Kathy Leung; Joseph T.

293,"Evaluating the use of the reproduction number as an epidemiological tool, using spatio-temporal trends of the Covid-19 outbreak in England","The time-varying reproduction number (Rt: the average number secondary infections caused by each infected person) may be used to assess changes in transmission potential during an epidemic. Since new infections usually are not observed directly, it can only be estimated from delayed and potentially biased data. We estimated Rt using a model that mapped unobserved infections to observed test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with confirmed Covid-19, in seven regions of England over March through August 2020. We explored the sensitivity of Rt estimates of Covid-19 in England to different data sources, and investigated the potential of using differences in the estimates to track epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups.

Our estimates of transmission potential varied for each data source. The divergence between estimates from each source was not consistent within or across regions over time, although estimates based on hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally synchronous than compared to estimates from all test-positives. We compared differences in Rt with the demographic and social context of transmission, and found the differences between Rt may be linked to biased representations of sub-populations in each data source: from uneven testing rates, or increasing severity of disease with age, seen via outbreaks in care home populations and changing age distributions of cases.

We highlight that policy makers should consider the source populations of Rt estimates. Further work should clarify the best way to combine and interpret Rt estimates from different data sources based on the desired use.",Katharine Sherratt; Sam Abbott; Sophie Meakin; Joel Hellewell; James D Munday; Nikos Bosse; - CMMID Covid-19 working group; Mark Jit; Sebastian Funk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214585,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214585,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,True
294,"Evaluation of Nowcasting for Real-Time COVID-19 Tracking - New York City, March-May 2020","To account for delays between specimen collection and report, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene used a time-correlated Bayesian nowcasting approach to support real-time COVID-19 situational awareness. We retrospectively evaluated nowcasting performance for case counts among residents diagnosed during March-May 2020, a period when the median reporting delay was 2 days. Nowcasts with a 2-week moving window and a negative binomial distribution had lower mean absolute error, lower relative root mean square error, and higher 95% prediction interval coverage than nowcasts conducted with a 3-week moving window or with a Poisson distribution. Nowcasts conducted toward the end of the week outperformed nowcasts performed earlier in the week, given fewer patients diagnosed on weekends and lack of day-of-week adjustments. When estimating case counts for weekdays only, metrics were similar across days the nowcasts were conducted, with Mondays having the lowest mean absolute error, of 183 cases in the context of an average daily weekday case count of 2,914. Nowcasting ensured that recent decreases in observed case counts were not overinterpreted as true declines and supported health department leadership in anticipating the magnitude and timing of hospitalizations and deaths and allocating resources geographically.",Sharon K.

295,Real-life validation of the Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (Abbott) in community-dwelling subjects with symptoms of potential SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundRT-qPCR is the reference test for identification of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, but is associated with diagnostic delay. Antigen detection assays can generate results within 20 minutes and outside of laboratory settings. Yet, their diagnostic test performance in real life settings has not been determined.

MethodsThe diagnostic value of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), was determined in comparison to RT-qPCR (Seegene Allplex) in community-dwelling mildly symptomatic subjects in a medium (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and high endemic area (Aruba), using two concurrently obtained nasopharyngeal swabs.

Findings1367 and 208 subjects were enrolled in Utrecht and Aruba, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, based on RT-qPCR, was 10.2% (n=139) and 30.3% (n=63) in Utrecht and Aruba respectively. Specificity of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test was 100% (95%CI: 99.7-100%) in both settings. Test sensitivity was 72.6% (95%CI: 64.5-79.9%) in the Netherlands and 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0-89.8%) in Aruba. Probability of false negative results was associated with RT-qPCR Ct-values, but not with duration of symptoms. Restricting RT-qPCR test positivity to Ct-values <32 yielded test sensitivities of 95.2% (95%CI: 89.3-98.5%) in the Netherlands and 98.0% (95%CI: 89.2-99.95%) in Aruba.

InterpretationIn community-dwelling subjects with mild respiratory symptoms the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had 100% specificity, and a sensitivity above 95% for nasopharyngeal samples when using Ct values <32 cycles as cut-off for RT-qPCR test positivity. Considering short turnaround times, user friendliness, low costs and opportunities for decentralized testing, this test can improve our efforts to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Based on the advantages of using zebrafish as a model in research, herein we suggest doing this to test the safety of the putative vaccine candidates and to study immune response against the virus. We produced a recombinant N-terminal fraction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and injected it into adult female zebrafish. The specimens generated humoral immunity and passed the antibodies to the eggs. However, they presented adverse reactions and inflammatory responses similar to severe cases of human COVID-19. The analysis of the structure and function of zebrafish and human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the main human receptor for virus infection, presented remarkable sequence similarities. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis predicted protein-protein interaction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 fragment and the Toll-like receptor pathway. It might help in the choice of future therapeutic pharmaceutical drugs to be studied.

298,Isolation of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies against divergent human coronaviruses that delineate a conserved and vulnerable site on the spike protein,"The coronavirus spike glycoprotein, located on the virion surface, is the key mediator of cell entry. As such, it is an attractive target for the development of protective antibodies and vaccines. Here we describe two human monoclonal antibodies, 1.6C7 and 28D9, that display a remarkable cross-reactivity against distinct species from three Betacoronavirus subgenera, capable of binding the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Both antibodies, derived from immunized transgenic mice carrying a human immunoglobulin repertoire, blocked MERS-CoV infection in cells, whereas 28D9 also showed weak cross-neutralizing potential against HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a neutralization-sensitive virus pseudotyping system, but not against authentic virus. Both cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies were found to target the stem helix in the spike protein S2 fusion subunit which, in the prefusion conformation of trimeric spike, forms a surface exposed membrane-proximal helical bundle, that is antibody-accessible. We demonstrate that administration of these antibodies in mice protects from a lethal MERS-CoV challenge in both prophylactic and/or therapeutic models. Collectively, these antibodies delineate a conserved, immunogenic and vulnerabe site on the spike protein which spurs the development of broad-range diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures against coronaviruses.",Chunyan Wang; Rien van Haperen; Javier Gutierrez-Alvarez; Wentao Li; Nisreen Okba; Irina Albulescu; Ivy Widjaja; Brenda van Dieren; Raul Fernandez-Delgado; Isabel Sola; Daniel Hurdiss; Olalekan Daramola; Frank Grosveld; Frank van Kuppeveld; Bart Haagmans; Luis Enjuanes; Dubravka Drabek; Berend-Jan Bosch,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.346916,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.346916,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,False
299,High-throughput detection of antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in longitudinal convalescent plasma samples,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing more than a million deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and represent the main target for antibody responses. Humoral responses were shown to be important for preventing and controlling infection by coronaviruses. A promising approach to reduce the severity of COVID-19 is the transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, longitudinal studies revealed that the level of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines rapidly after the resolution of the infection.

Study Design and MethodsTo extend this observation beyond the RBD domain, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the plasma from 15 convalescent donors. We generated a 293T cell line constitutively expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and used it to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific antibodies in the plasma of convalescent donors.

Results and ConclusionWe found that the level of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines gradually after the resolution of the infection. This decline was not related to the number of donations, but strongly correlated with the decline of RBD-specific antibodies and the number of days post-symptom onset. These findings help to better understand the decline of humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provide important information on when to collect plasma after recovery from active infection for convalescent plasma transfusion.",Sai Priya Anand; Jeremie Prevost; Jonathan Richard; Josee Perreault; Tony Tremblay; Mathieu Drouin; Marie-Josee Fournier; Antoine Lewin; Renee Bazin; Andres Finzi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.346783,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.346783,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,False
300,Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals dysregulation of molecular programs associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity and outcomes in patients with chronic lung disease,"RationalePatients with chronic lung disease have an increased risk for severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and poor outcomes.

ObjectivesTo identify molecular characteristics of diseased lung epithelial and immune cells that may account for worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with chronic lung diseases.

MethodsWe analyzed the transcriptomes of 605,904 single cells isolated from healthy (79 samples) and diseased human lungs (31 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 82 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 18 non-IPF interstitial lung disease samples).

Measurements and Main ResultsCellular distribution and relative expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (ACE2, TMPRSS2) was similar in disease and control lungs. Epithelial cells isolated from diseased lungs expressed higher levels of genes linked directly to efficiency of viral replication and the innate immune response. Unique ACE2-correlated gene sets were identified for each diagnosis group in the type II alveolar cells. Diseased lungs have a significant increase in the proportion of CD4, CD8 and NK cells compared to control lungs. Components of the interferon pathway, the IL6 cytokine pathway and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes are upregulated in several diseased immune cell types. These differences in inflammatory gene expression programs highlight how chronic lung disease alters the inflammatory microenvironment encountered upon viral exposure to the peripheral lung.

301,Impact of clade specific mutations on structural fidelity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins,"The SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus with a genome size of ~29.9 kilobase pairs which spans 29 open reading frames. Studies have revealed that the genome encodes about 16 non-structural proteins (nsp), four structural proteins, and six or seven accessory proteins. Based on prevalent knowledge on SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, functions have been assigned for majority of the proteins. While, researchers across the globe are engrossed in identifying a potential pharmacological intervention to control the viral outbreak, none of the work has come up with new antiviral drugs or vaccines yet. One possible approach that has shown some positive results is by treating infected patients with the plasma collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Several vaccines around the world have entered their final trial phase in humans and we expect that these will in time be available for application to worldwide population to combat the disease. In this work we analyse the effect of prevalent mutations in the major pathogenesis related proteins of SARS-COV2 and attempt to pinpoint the effects of those mutations on the structural stability of the proteins. Our observations and analysis direct us to identify that all the major mutations have a negative impact in context of stability of the viral proteins under study and the mutant proteins suffer both structural and functional alterations as a result of the mutations. Our binary scoring scheme identifies L84S mutation in ORF8 as the most disruptive of the mutations under study.

We used 3D coarse-grained computational models to estimate the antibody pressure on the seasonal flu H1N1 and the SARS subgenus spikes. Analyzing publically available sequences, we show that antibody pressure, through the geometrical organization of these spikes on the viral surface, shaped their mutability. Studying the mutability patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic spikes, we find that they are not predominantly shaped by antibody pressure. However, for SARS-CoV-2, we find that over time, it acquired, at low frequency, several mutations at antibody-accessible positions, which could indicate possible escape as define by our model. Hence, we offer a geometry-based approach to estimate and assess whether a pandemic virus is changing its mutational pattern to that indicative of a circulating virus.",Assaf Amitai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347641,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.347641,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,,False
303,Analysis of respiratory and systemic immune responses in COVID-19 reveals mechanisms of disease pathogenesis,"Immune responses to respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 originate and function in the lung, yet assessments of human immunity are often limited to blood. Here, we conducted longitudinal, high-dimensional profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19, revealing immune processes in the respiratory tract linked to disease pathogenesis. Survival from severe disease was associated with increased CD4+T cells and decreased monocyte/macrophage frequencies in the airway, but not in blood. Airway T cells and macrophages exhibited tissue-resident phenotypes and activation signatures, including high level expression and secretion of monocyte chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL3 by airway macrophages. By contrast, monocytes in blood expressed the CCL2-receptor CCR2 and aberrant CD163+ and immature phenotypes. Extensive accumulation of CD163+monocyte/macrophages within alveolar spaces in COVID-19 lung autopsies suggested recruitment from circulation. Our findings provide evidence that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by respiratory immunity, and rationale for site-specific treatment and prevention strategies.",Peter A.

304,Development and pre-clinical characterization of two therapeutic equine formulations towards SARS-CoV-2 proteins for the potential treatment of COVID-19,"In the current global emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, passive immunotherapy emerges as a promising treatment for COVID-19. Among animal-derived products, equine formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials.

305,A novel viral protein translation mechanism reveals mitochondria as a target for antiviral drug development,"The ongoing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has acutely highlighted the need to identify new treatment strategies for viral infections. Here we present a pivotal molecular mechanism of viral protein translation that relies on the mitochondrial translation machinery. We found that rare codons such as Leu-TTA are highly enriched in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and these codons are essential for the regulation of viral protein expression. SARS-CoV-2 controls the translation of its spike gene by hijacking host mitochondria through 5 leader and 3UTR sequences that contain mitochondrial localization signals and activate the EGR1 pathway. Mitochondrial-targeted drugs such as lonidamine and polydatin significantly repress rare codon-driven gene expression and viral replication. This study identifies an unreported viral protein translation mechanism and opens up a novel avenue for developing antiviral drugs.

306,Structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase inhibition by Favipiravir,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into an unprecedented global pandemic. Nucleoside analogues, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir, can serve as the first-line broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against the newly emerging viral diseases. Recent clinical trials of these two drugs for SARS-CoV-2 treatment revealed antiviral efficacies as well as side effects with different extents1-4. As a pyrazine derivative, Favipiravir could be incorporated into the viral RNA products by mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides, which may further lead to mutations in progeny RNA copies due to the non-conserved base-pairing capacity5. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-catalytic state. This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing the catalysis dynamics of coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir and pyrimidine residues which may explain its capacity for mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides.

307,SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted through the air between ferrets over more than one meter distance,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and caused a pandemic, whereas the closely related SARS-CoV was contained rapidly in 2003. Here, a newly developed experimental set-up was used to study transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through the air between ferrets over more than a meter distance. Both viruses caused a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmitted efficiently. Serological assays confirmed all virus transmission events. Although the experiments did not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious while travelling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms. Although the evidence for airborne virus transmission between humans under natural conditions is absent or weak for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ferrets may represent a sensitive model to study interventions aimed at preventing virus transmission.",Jasmin S Kutter; Dennis de Meulder; Theo M Bestebroer; Pascal Lexmond; Ard Mulders; Ron AM Fouchier; Sander Herfst,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345363,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.345363,2020-10-19,2020-10-19,,False

Herein the mutational status of 611 genomes from India along with their impact on proteins was ascertained. After excluding gaps and ambiguous sequences, a total of 493 variable sites (152 parsimony informative and 341 singleton) were observed. The most prevalent reference nucleotide was C (209) and substituted one was T (293). NSP3 had the highest incidence of 101 sites followed by S protein (74 sites), NSP12b (43 sites) and ORF3a (31 sites). The average number of mutations per sample for males and females was 2.56 and 2.88 respectively suggesting a higher contribution of mutations from females. Non-uniform geographical distribution of mutations implied by Odisha (30 samples, 109 mutations) and Tamil Nadu (31 samples, 40 mutations) suggests that sequences in some regions are mutating faster than others.

It enables identification of patients who may be at higher risk than others to COVID-19-related mortality, due to their genetic architecture, or who might respond better to a COVID-19 treatment. The COVID-19 virus, similar to SARS-CoV, uses the ACE2 receptor for cell entry and employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral S protein priming. This study aspires to present a multi-omics view of how variations in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes affect COVID-19 infection and disease progression in affected individuals. It reports, for both genes, several variant and gene expression analysis findings, through (i) comparison analysis over single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that may account for the difference of COVID-19 manifestations among global sub-populations; (ii) calculating prevalence of structural variations (copy number variations (CNVs) / insertions), amongst populations; and (iii) studying expression patterns stratified by gender and age, over all human tissues.

311,Diversity and genomic determinants of the microbiomes associated with COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging and highly transmissible disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding the microbiomes associated with the upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 diseases has clinical interest. We hypothesized that the diversity of microbiome compositions and their genomic features are associated with different pathological conditions of these human respiratory tract diseases (COVID-19 and non-COVID; URTI and COPD). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 21 whole metagenome sequences (WMS) including eleven COVID-19 (BD = 6 and China = 5), six COPD (UK = 6) and four URTI (USA = 4) samples to unravel the diversity of microbiomes, their genomic features and relevant metabolic functions. The WMS data mapped to 534 bacterial, 60 archaeal and 61 viral genomes with distinct variation in the microbiome composition across the samples (COVID-19>COPD>URTI). Notably, 94.57%, 80.0% and 24.59% bacterial, archaeal and viral genera shared between the COVID-19 and non-COVID samples, respectively, however, the COVID-19 related samples had sole association with 16 viral genera other than SARS-CoV-2. Strain-level virome profiling revealed 660 and 729 strains in COVID-19 and non-COVID sequence data, respectively and of them 34.50% strains shared between the conditions. Functional annotation of metagenomics sequences of thevCOVID-19 and non-COVID groups identified the association of several biochemical pathways related to basic metabolism (amino acid and energy), ABC transporters, membrane transport, replication and repair, clustering-based subsystems, virulence, disease and defense, adhesion, regulation of virulence, programmed cell death, and primary immunodeficiency. We also detected 30 functional gene groups/classes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds (RATC) in both COVID-19 and non-COVID microbiomes. Furthermore, a predominant higher abundance of cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance (CZCR) and multidrug resistance to efflux pumps (MREP) genes were detected in COVID-19 metagenome. The profiles of microbiome diversity and associated microbial genomic features found in both COVID-19 and non-COVID (COPD and URTI) samples might be helpful for developing the microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases.

Soluble decoy receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize infection and, due to close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We find an engineered decoy receptor, sACE22.v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain followed by in vitro selection, with wild type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild type receptor.

315,"Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge","BackgroundThe medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood.

MethodsFifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments.

FindingsAt 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and a significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls.

InterpretationA significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute to impaired quality of life.

316,"HIV testing by public health centers and municipalities, and new HIV cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, medical resources were primarily allocated to COVID-19, which might have reduced facility capacity for HIV testing. Further, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and its consequences in Japan.

MethodsWe analysed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations that public health centers received, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. As sensitivity analyses, we performed the same analysis for two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese.

FindingsThe number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, while the proportion of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases (36{middle dot}2% vs. 26{middle dot}4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. The number of HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis numerically decreased (166 vs. 217), although the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trend for the MSM and non-Japanese groups.

InterpretationThe current HIV testing system including public health centers misses more HIV cases at the early phase of the infection during the pandemic. Given that the clear epidemiological picture of HIV incidence during the pandemic is still uncertain, continuously monitoring the situation as well as securing sufficient test resources using self-test is essential.

We found no published work relevant to our study.

Added value of this studyDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the public health centers and municipalities temporarily suspended facility-based HIV testing to concentrate their limited resources to COVID-19 testing. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of HIV tests in public health centers and municipalities, and on the number of HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. We confirmed that the number of the test declined in the second quarter (April to June) of 2020, and the proportion of HIV with AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases increased during the same period.

Implications of all the available evidenceProviding sufficient HIV testing opportunities even during the pandemic, when facility-based testing is challenging, is necessary for better clinical and public health outcomes.

320,Tracking SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the wastewater treatment process,"The municipal sewage carries the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), shed by COVID-19 patients, to wastewater treatment plants. Proper wastewater treatment can provide an important barrier for preventing uncontrolled discharged of the virus into the environment. However, the role of the different wastewater treatment stages in reducing virus concentrations was, thus far, unknown. In this work, we quantified SARS-CoV-RNA in the raw sewage and along the main stages of the wastewater process from two different plants in Israel during this COVID-19 outbreak. We found that ca. 2 Log removal could be attained after primary and secondary treatment. Despite this removal, significant concentrations of SARS-CoV-RNA (>100 copies per mL) could still be detected in the treated wastewater. However, after treatment by chlorination, SARS-CoV-RNA was detected only once, likely due to insufficient chlorine dose. Our results highlight the need to protect wastewater treatment plants operators, as well as populations living near areas of wastewater discharge, from the risk of infection. In addition, our results emphasize the capabilities and limitations of the conventional wastewater treatment process in reducing SARS-CoV-RNA concentration, and present preliminary evidence for the importance of tertiary treatment and chlorination in reducing SARA-CoV-2 dissemination.",Hala Abu-Ali; Karin Yaniv; Edo Bar-Zeev; Sanhita Chaudhury; Marilou Shaga; Satish Lakkakula; Zeev Ronen; Ariel Kushmaro; Oded Nir,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212837,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212837,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True
321,Role of Professionalism in the Policy Response to COVID-19: Does a Public Health or Medical Background Help?,"Less than 5 percent of Chinese cities had top-ranked officials with public health or medical backgrounds (PHMBGs). Does professionalism improve their response to a public crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic? Collecting resumes of government and Party officials in almost all prefectural Chinese cities, and matching with other data sources, including weather conditions, city characteristics, COVID-19-related policies, and health outcomes, we demonstrate that cities whose top officials had PHMBGs witnessed significantly lower infection rates, and often lower death rates, than cities whose top officials lacked such backgrounds. Mechanism testing suggests that the effects were at least partially explained by more rapid lockdown or community closure. Our findings offer insights into better preparation for future epidemics via improving leadership team composition, particularly recruiting major officials with PHMBGs.

322,Melatonin is significantly associated with survival of intubated COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundRespiratory distress requiring intubation is the most serious complication associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MethodsIn this retrospective study, we used survival analysis to determine whether or not mortality following intubation was associated with hormone exposure in patients treated at New York Presbyterian/ Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Here, we report the overall hazards ratio for each hormone for exposure before and after intubation for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.

ResultsAmong the 189,987 patients, we identified 948 intubation periods across 791 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or infected with SARS-CoV2 and 3,497 intubation periods across 2,981 patients who were not. Melatonin exposure after intubation was statistically associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.131, 95% CI: 7.76E-02 - 0.223, p-value = 8.19E-14) and non-COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.278, 95% CI: 0.142 - 0.542, p-value = 1.72E-04) intubated patients. Additionally, melatonin exposure after intubation was statically associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 patients (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.127, 95% CI: 6.01E-02 - 0.269, p-value = 7.15E-08).

ConclusionsMelatonin exposure after intubation is significantly associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, melatonin exposure after intubation is significantly associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. While our models account for many covariates, including clinical history and demographics, it is impossible to rule out confounding or collider biases within our population.

323,Modelling SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a UK university setting,"BackgroundThe higher education system in the United Kingdom comprises a large student population. Around 40% of school leavers attend university and individual universities generally host thousands of students each academic year. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing together these student communities presents questions regarding the strength of interventions required to control transmission. Prior modelling analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within universities has usually adopted a compartmental modelling approach, whose projections suggest an almost inevitable likelihood of outbreaks.

MethodsWe constructed a network-based model to capture the interactions of a student population in different settings (housing, social and study). For a representative campus-based university, we ran a susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered type epidemic process, parameterised according to available estimates for SARS-CoV-2. Over the course of a single academic term, we investigated the impact on infection control of adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation, test and trace measures, the additional use of room isolation as an intervention and supplementary mass testing.

ResultsIncorporating uncertainty in the fraction of cases that are asymptomatic and their associated infectivity, in the absence of interventions our model estimated that 16% (2% - 38%) of the student population could be infected during the autumn term. In contrast, with full adherence to isolation measures and engagement with test-and-trace, predictions of the cumulative infection count were lower, 1.4% (0.4% - 5%). Irrespective of the adherence to isolation measures, on average a higher proportion of students resident on-campus became infected compared with students resident off-campus. Widespread adherence of interventions led to reductions in the average fraction of time those individuals adhering to measures were expected to be isolated, with room isolation as an additional intervention generating minimal benefits. The model found that a one-off instance of mass testing would not drastically reduce the term-long case load or end-of-term prevalence, but regular weekly or fortnightly testing could reduce both measures by more than 50% (compared to having no mass testing).

ConclusionsOur findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 may readily transmit amongst a student population within a university setting if there is limited adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions and there are delays present in receiving test results. Following isolation guidance and effective contact tracing both curbed transmission and reduced the expected time an adhering student would spend in isolation. Additionally, widespread adherence throughout the term suppresses the amount of unwitting asymptomatic transmission to family and community members in the students domicile regions at the end of term.",Edward M Hill; Benjamin D Atkins; Matt J Keeling; Michael Tildesley; Louise Dyson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20208454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20208454,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True
324,Predictors of severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 reinfection,"BackgroundThere is a major concern regarding the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who recovered to first-time illness.

ObjectiveTo evaluate factors predicting severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed (reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR) SARS-COV-2 (severe acute coronavirus-2) reinfection.

MethodWe conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in Mexico and data from 258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-COV-2 infection.

ResultsThe risk of severe disease was 14.7% and the observed overall fatality rate was 4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.001) during reinfection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RR per year = 1.007, 95% CI 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.38] and previous severe laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39).

ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating disease outcomes in a large set of laboratory-positive cases of symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection and factors associated with illness severity was characterized. Our results may contribute to the current knowledge of SARS-COV-2 pathogenicity and to identify populations at increased risk of a poorer outcome after reinfection.",Efren Murillo-Zamora; Oliver Mendoza-Cano; Ivan Delgado-Enciso; CARLOS M HERNANDEZ-SUAREZ,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212720,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212720,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True
325,Aging and COVID-19 mortality: A demographic perspective,"Demographers were among the first to emphasize the importance of age in explaining the spread and impact on mortality of COVID-19. Yet, the relationship between age and COVID-19 is not fully understood. This study aims to answer the following questions: Do COVID-19 deaths follow the Gompertz force of mortality? How does the relationship between age and COVID-19 mortality compare with other major causes of death? Does this relationship vary between countries? Using US vital Statistics, COVID-19 mortality doubling time is compared with 68 major cause of death categories. COVID-19 fatality is similarly compared across 33 countries using COVerAGE-DB, a harmonized dataset of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Several findings are supported by the evidence. First, COVID-19 mortality increasing exponentially with age at a rate near the median of aging-related causes of death, as well as pneumonia and influenza. Second, COVID-19 mortality levels in the US are currently 4 to 8 times higher than pneumonia and influenza across the adult age range. Third, the relationship between COVID-19 fatality and age varies considerably across high-income countries. Fourth, these regularities can be utilized for indirect estimation of COVID-19 deaths by age. In conclusion, the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and age resembles the population rate of aging. Between-country variation in the Gompertz slope of COVID-19 fatality may point to differences in underlying population health, standards of clinical care, and data quality.",Isaac Sasson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213454,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True
326,National Routine Adult Immunization Programs among World Health Organization Member States: An Assessment of Health Systems to Deploy Future SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines,"IntroductionAs the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic disproportionately affects older adults, future pandemic vaccine response will rely on existing adult immunization infrastructures.

MethodsWe evaluated the 2018 WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on Immunization for country reports on adult immunization programs. We described countries with programs and used multivariable regression to identify independent factors associated with having them.

ResultsOf 194 WHO Member States, 120 (62%) reported having any adult vaccination program. The Americas and Europe had the most adult immunization programs, most commonly Hepatitis B and influenza vaccines (>45% and >90% of countries). Africa and South-East Asia had the fewest adult immunization programs, with <11% of countries reporting any adult immunization programs for influenza or hepatitis vaccines, and none for pneumococcal vaccines. In bivariate analyses, high- or upper-middle income, introduction of new or underused vaccines, having achieved pediatric vaccine coverage goals, and meeting National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups basic functional indicators were significantly associated (p<0.001) with having any adult immunization programs. In multivariable analyses, the factor most strongly associated with adult immunization programs was country income, with high- or upper-middle income countries significantly more likely to report having a program (aOR 19.3, 95% CI 6.5, 57.7).

DiscussionThat 38% of countries lack functional platforms for adult immunization has major implications for future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine deployment. Systems for vaccine storage and handling, delivery, and waste management for adult immunization do not exist in much of the world. Developing countries should strengthen immunization programs to reach adults with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines when they become available.",Sarah R Williams; Amanda J Driscoll; Hanna M LeBuhn; Wilbur H Chen; Kathleen M Neuzil; Justin R Ortiz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213967,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213967,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,True

Here, we demonstrate the utility of volumetric three-dimensional (3D) immunofluorescence imaging using tissue optical clearing and light sheet microscopy to investigate host-pathogen interactions of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets at a mesoscopic scale. The superior spatial context of large, intact samples (> 150 mm3) allowed detailed quantification of interrelated parameters like focus-to-focus distance or SARS-CoV-2-infected area, facilitating an in-depth description of SARS-CoV-2 infection foci. Accordingly, we could confirm a preferential infection of the ferret upper respiratory tract by SARS-CoV-2 and emphasize a distinct focal infection pattern in nasal turbinates. Conclusively, we present a proof-of-concept study for investigating critically important respiratory pathogens in their spatial tissue morphology and demonstrate the first specific 3D visualization of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Luca M.

329,Adult Stem Cell-derived Complete Lung Organoid Models Emulate Lung Disease in COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, causes widespread damage in the lungs in the setting of an overzealous immune response whose origin remains unclear. We present a scalable, propagable, personalized, cost-effective adult stem cell-derived human lung organoid model that is complete with both proximal and distal airway epithelia. Monolayers derived from adult lung organoids (ALOs), primary airway cells, or hiPSC-derived alveolar type-II (AT2) pneumocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to create in vitro lung models of COVID-19. Infected ALO-monolayers best recapitulated the transcriptomic signatures in diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patient-derived respiratory samples. The airway (proximal) cells were critical for sustained viral infection, whereas distal alveolar differentiation (AT2[-&gt;]AT1) was critical for mounting the overzealous host immune response in fatal disease; ALO monolayers with well-mixed proximodistal airway components recapitulated both. Findings validate a human lung model of COVID-19, which can be immediately utilized to investigate COVID-19 pathogenesis and vet new therapies and vaccines.

330,Molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by temperature,"Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be inactivated by effect of heat, even though, little is known about the molecular changes induced by the temperature. Here, we unravel the basics of such inactivation mechanism over the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by executing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Both the closed down and open up states, which determine the accessibility to the receptor binding domain, were considered. Results suggest that the spike undergoes drastic changes in the topology of the hydrogen bond network while salt bridges are mainly preserved. Reorganization in the hydrogen bonds structure produces conformational variations in the receptor binding subunit and explain the thermal inactivation of the virus. Conversely, the macrostructure of the spike is preserved at high temperature because of the retained salt bridges. The proposed mechanism has important implications for engineering new approaches to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Didac Marti; Joan Torras; Oscar Bertran; Pau Turon; Carlos Aleman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.343459,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.343459,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,,False
331,"Structure, Dynamics, Receptor Binding, and Antibody Binding of Fully-glycosylated Full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in a Viral Membrane","The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates host cell entry by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and is considered the major target for drug and vaccine development. We previously built fully-glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both open and closed conformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) and different templates for the stalk region. In this work, multiple s-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide deeper insight into the structure and dynamics of S protein, and glycan functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of RBD, and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis instead of a commonly-used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibody.

332,Ongoing Adaptive Evolution and Globalization of Sars-Cov-2,"Unprecedented sequencing efforts have, as of October 2020, produced over 100,000 genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Understanding the trends in SARS-CoV-2 evolution is paramount to control the pandemic. Although this extensive data availability quickly facilitated the development of vaccine candidates1, major challenges in the analysis of this enormous dataset persist, limiting the ability of public health officials to translate science into policy. Having evolved over a short period of time, the SARS-CoV-2 isolates show low diversity, necessitating analysis of trees built from genome-scale data. Here we provide a complete ancestral genome reconstruction for SARS-CoV-2 leveraging Fitch Traceback2. We show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection. However, a small set of sites, including the extensively studied spike 6143, harbor mutations which recurred on multiple, independent occasions, indicative of positive selection. These mutations form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions. The phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 consists of 7 major clades which show distinct global and temporal dynamics. Periods of regional diversification of SARS-CoV-2 are short and, despite dramatically reduced travel4, globalization of the virus is apparent.",Nash D Rochman; Yuri I.

334,TREATMENT PROFILES AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF COVID-19 PATIENTS AT PRIVATE HOSPITAL IN JAKARTA,"BackgroundSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes COVID-19, which has become a worldwide pandemic. However, until now, there is no vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19.

ObjectivesTo find out the effective treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion.

ResultsThe survival analysis for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment for about ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) also did not have a significant correlation with clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Comorbidities showed a significant correlation with duration of treatment (p = 0.002) and clinical outcome (p = 0.014) of COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionThe most effective antiviral agent in this study based on treatment duration was the combination of Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine.

335,Recovery of monocyte exhaustion is associated with resolution of lung injury in COVID-19 convalescence.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection resulting in the clinical syndrome COVID-19 is associated with an exaggerated immune response and monocyte infiltrates in the lungs and other peripheral tissues. It is now increasingly recognised that chronic morbidity persists in some patients. We recently demonstrated profound alterations of monocytes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. It is currently unclear whether these abnormalities resolve or progress following patient discharge. We show here that blood monocytes in convalescent patients at their 12 week follow up, have a greater propensity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6, which was consistently higher in patients with resolution of lung injury as indicated by a normal chest X-ray and no shortness of breath (a key symptom of lung injury). Furthermore, monocytes from convalescent patients also displayed enhanced levels of molecules involved in leucocyte migration, including chemokine receptor CXCR6, adhesion molecule CD31/PECAM and integrins VLA-4 and LFA-1. Expression of migration molecules on monocytes was also consistently higher in convalescent patients with a normal chest X-ray. These data suggest persistent changes in innate immune function following recovery from COVID-19 and indicate that immune modulating therapies targeting monocytes and leucocyte migration may be useful in recovering COVID-19 patients with persistent symptoms.",Nicholas A Scott; Sean Blandin Knight; Laurence Pearmain; Oliver Brand; David J Morgan; Chris Jagger; Saba Khan; Pamela Hackney; Lara Smith; Madhvi Menon; Joanne Konkel; Halima A Shuwa; Miriam Franklin; Verena Kaestele; Sarah Harbach; Seema Brij; Andrew Ustianowski; Alison Uriel; Gabriella Lindergard; Nawar Diar Bakerly; Paul Dark; Alexander Mathioudakis; Kathryn Gray; Graham Lord; Timothy Felton; Chris Brightling; Ling-Pei Ho; - NIHR Respiratory TRC; - CIRCO; Karen Piper Hanley; Angela Simpson; John R Grainger; Tracy Hussell; Elizabeth R Mann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20207449,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20207449,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
336,sMAdCAM:IL-6 (sMIL Index): A novel signature associated with COVID-19 disease progression and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,"IMPORTANCERecent studies positing the gut as a sanctuary site for viral persistence in SARS-CoV-2 infection highlight the importance of assimilating profiles of systemic as well as gut inflammatory mediators to understand the pathology of COVID-19. Also, the role of these markers in governing virus specific immunity following infection remains largely unexplored.

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the role of systemic and gut inflammatory markers in disease progression and development of anti-viral humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTSThis cohort study (n=58) of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals included a group of in-patients (n=36) at various stages of disease progression together with convalescent individuals (n=22) recruited between April and June 2020 (peak of the epidemic) from a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. Follow-up of 11 in-patients at day 7 post diagnosis was carried out, resulting in a total of 47 in-patient samples.

EXPOSURESDiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based testing of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPrimary outcomes were the measurement of inflammatory markers including Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines and levels of soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (sMAdCAM) in plasma. Anti-viral humoral response was measured by rapid antibody test (IgG, IgM) and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (IgG). Also antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Secondary outcomes were correlation of the inflammatory signature with clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration and co-morbidities.

RESULTSTwenty eight of 36 (78%) in-patients and 19 of 22 (86%) convalescents were males. Out of 47 in-patient samples, 22 (46%), 11 (23%) and 14 (30%) were IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-respectively. Of 22 convalescent samples, 3 (14%), 1 (4%) and 17 (77%) were respectively IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-. Two out of 22 (9%) convalescents showed high IL-6 levels (>100pg/ml) and 4 (18%) had high TNF levels (>30pg/ml). However, the convalescents (n =22) had significantly lower levels of IL-6 [Median=27.48 (IQR=23.54-39.92)] compared to followed up in-patients (n = 11) at day 0 [Median=111(IQR=68-129.7), p =0.0002] and higher levels of sMAdCAM [Median=1940 (1711-2174) pg/ml] compared to these individuals at day 0 [Median=1701 (IQR=1532-1836) pg/ml; p=0.032] and day 7 [Median=1534 (IQR=1236-1654) pg/ml; p=0.0007]. Further, IL-6 and sMAdCAM levels among in-patients inversely correlated with one another (r = -0.374, p = 0.009, CI = 95%). When expressed as a novel integrated marker -sMIL (sMAdCAM/IL-6 ratio) index, these levels were incrementally and significantly higher across various disease states with convalescents exhibiting the highest values [Median= 64.74 (IQR=47.33-85.58)]. Also, the sMIL index was significantly higher in convalescents (with class-switched responses) compared to IgG+/IgM+ individuals at early stages of infection [Median=28.65 (IQR=13.63-96.26), p = 0.034]. Real-time measurement by SPR of plasma antibody binding to viral nucleocapsid (NC), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) revealed waxing and waning of plasma antibody responses to all 3 targets. Importantly, sMAdCAM levels as well as sMIL index (fold change) correlated with peak association rates of RBD-binding (r = 0.462, p = 0.03, CI = 95%) and fold change in binding to S (r = 0.68, p = 0.050, CI = 95%) respectively.

CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCEOur results highlight key systemic and gut-associated immune parameters that need to be monitored and investigated further to optimally guide therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for COVID-19.

337,SARS-CoV-2 S protein ACE2 interaction reveals novel allosteric targets,"The Spike (S) protein is the main handle for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells through surface ACE2 receptors. How ACE2 binding activates proteolysis of S protein is unknown. Here, we have mapped the S:ACE2 interface and uncovered long-range allosteric propagation of ACE2 binding to sites critical for viral host entry. Unexpectedly, ACE2 binding enhances dynamics at a distal S1/S2 cleavage site and flanking protease docking site ~27 [A] away while dampening dynamics of the stalk hinge (central helix and heptad repeat) regions ~ 130 [A] away. This highlights that the stalk and proteolysis sites of the S protein are dynamic hotspots in the pre-fusion state. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for S:ACE2 complex formation, critical for proteolytic processing and viral-host membrane fusion and highlight protease docking sites flanking the S1/S2 cleavage site, fusion peptide and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) as allosterically exposed cryptic hotspots for potential therapeutic development.

338,Novel Machine-Learned Approach for COVID-19 Resource Allocation: A Tool for EvaluatingCommunity Susceptibility,"Despite worldwide efforts to develop an effective COVID vaccine, it is quite evident that initial supplies will be limited. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that will ensure that the COVID vaccine is allocated to the people who are at major risk until there is a sufficient global supply. Herein, I developed a machine-learning tool that could be applied to assess the risk in communities based on social, medical, and lifestyle risk factors. As a ""proof of concept,"" I modeled COVID risk in the Massachusetts communities using 29 risk factors, including the prevalence of preexisting comorbid conditions like COPD and social factors such as racial composition. Of the 29 factors, 14 were found to be significant (p < 0.1) indicators: poverty, food insecurity, lack of high school education, lack of health insurance coverage, premature mortality, population, population density, recent population growth, Asian percentage, high-occupancy housing, and preexisting prevalence of cancer, COPD, overweightness, and heart attacks. The machine-learning approach finds the 9 highest risk communities in the state of Massachusetts: Lynn, Brockton, Revere, Randolph, Lowell, New Bedford, Everett, Waltham, and Fitchburg. The 5 most at-risk counties are Suffolk, Middlesex, Bristol, Norfolk, and Plymouth. With appropriate data, the tool could evaluate risk in other communities, or even enumerate individual patient susceptibility.

339,Analysis of Collective Response Reveals that COVID-19-Related Activities Start From the End of 2019 in Mainland China,"While the COVID-19 outbreak is making an impact at a global scale, the collective response to the pandemic becomes the key to analyzing past situations, evaluating current measures, and formulating future predictions. In this paper, we analyze the public reactions to the pandemic using search engine data and mobility data from Baidu Search and Baidu Maps respectively, where we particularly pay attentions to the early stage of pandemics and find early signals from the collective response to COVID-19. First, we correlate the number of confirmed cases per day to daily search queries of a large number of keywords through Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA), where the keywords top in the most critical days are believed the most relevant to the pandemic. We then categorize the ranking lists of keywords according to the specific regions of the search, such as Wuhan, Mainland China, the USA, and the whole world. Through the analysis on search, we succeed in identifying COVID-19 related collective response would not be earlier than the end of 2019 in Mainland China. Finally, we confirm this observation again using human mobility data, where we specifically compare the massive mobility traces, including the real-time population densities inside key hospitals and inter-city travels departing from/arriving in Wuhan, from 2018 to 2020.

340,Understanding the value of clinical symptoms of COVID-19. A logistic regression model,"BackgroundThe new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is responsible for the current pandemic outbreak worldwide. However, there is limited information regarding the set of specific symptoms of COVID-19. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the main symptoms associated with COVID-19 to aid in the clinical diagnosis for the rapid identification of cases.

Methods and findingsA cross sectional study of all those diagnosed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1 and May 24 in Argentina was conducted. The data includes clinical and demographic information from all subjects at the time of presentation, which were uploaded to the centralized national reporting system at health centers. A total of 67318 individuals were included in this study, where 12% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The study population was divided in two age groups, a group aged 0 to 55 years-old (<56 group), (median = 32, n=48748) and another group aged 56 to 103 years-old ([&ge;]56 group) (median =72, n=18570). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that out of a total of 23 symptoms, only five were found to have a positive association with COVID-19: anosmia (odds ratio [OR] 10.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.20-13.10, <56 group; OR 6.09 CI 3.05-12.20, [&ge;]56 group) dysgeusia (OR 3.67, CI 2.7-4.9, <56 group; OR 3.53 CI 1.52-8.18, [&ge;]56 group), low grade fever (37.5-37.9{degrees} C) (OR 1.61, CI 1.20-2.05, <56 group; OR 1.80 CI 1.07-3.06, [&ge;]56 group), cough (OR 1.20, CI 1.05-1.38, <56 group; OR 1.37 CI 1.04-1.80, [&ge;]56 group) and headache only in <56 group (OR 1.71, CI 1.48-1.99). In turn, at the time of presentation, the symptoms associated with respiratory problems: chest pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, respiratory failure and use of accessory muscles for breathing, had a negative association with COVID-19 (OR <1) or did not present statistical relevance (OR = 1).

With the intention of helping the clinical diagnosis, we designed a model to be able to identify possible cases of COVID-19. This model included 16 symptoms, the age and sex of the individuals, and was able to detect 80% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 with a specificity of 46%.

ConclusionsThe analysis of symptoms opens the opportunity for a guidance and improved symptoms based definition of suspected cases of COVID-19, where multiple factors (age, sex, symptoms and interaction between symptoms) are considered.

341,Title: COVID-19 and frontline health workers in West Africa: a scoping review,"IntroductionThe novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe global health threat since its emergence. Overcoming the virus is partly dependent on the holistic wellbeing of frontline health workers. Implications of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa could be substantial given the limited resources and logistics. This scoping review maps available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa.

Materials and methodsLiterature on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa were searched in six databases namely Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Africa Journals Online (AJOL) and CINAHL. Further search was done across websites of the ministries of health of West African countries and notable organisations. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings taking cognisance of the overarching purpose of the study and the research question.

ResultsOf the 67 studies identified, 19 were included in the final synthesis. Three main themes emerged and these are impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers, drivers of susceptibility to COVID-19 and government/donor support. A greater number of the studies originated from Nigeria. Each study reported at least one impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa. The impacts included death, fear, unwillingness to attend to COVID-19 patients and stigmatisation. Some health workers were not adhering to the safety protocols coupled with periodic shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and thereby had an increased susceptibility.

ConclusionBeing the first scoping review on the impact of COVID-19 on frontline health workers in West Africa, the study has illustrated the urgent need for West African governments to enact laws/rules that would compel all frontline health workers to adhere to all the COVID-19 protocols at the workplace. To end intermittent shortage or issue of inadequate PPEs, governments ought to liaise with local industries by empowering them, providing financial support and creating a conducive atmosphere for them to produce cost effective PPEs using available local resources.

342,On Modeling of COVID-19 for the Indian Subcontinent using Polynomial and Supervised Learning Regression,"COVID-19, a recently declared pandemic by WHO has taken the world by storm causing catastrophic damage to human life. The novel cornonavirus disease was first incepted in the Wuhan city of China on 31st December 2019. The symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Since the devastating phenomenon is essentially a time-series representation, accurate modeling may benefit in identifying the root cause and accelerate the diagnosis. In the current analysis, COVID-19 modeling is done for the Indian subcontinent based on the data collected for the total cases confirmed, daily recovered, daily deaths, total recovered and total deaths. The data is treated with total confirmed cases as the target variable and rest as feature variables. It is observed that Support vector regressions yields accurate results followed by Polynomial regression. Random forest regression results in overfitting followed by poor Bayesian regression due to highly correlated feature variables.

343,"CoViD-19, learning from the past: A wavelet and cross-correlation analysis of the epidemic dynamics looking to emergency calls and Twitter trends in Italian Lombardy region","The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Italy was detected on February the 20th in Lombardy region. Since that date, Lombardy has been the most affected Italian region by the epidemic, and its healthcare system underwent a severe crisis during the outbreak. From a public health point of view, therefore, it is fundamental to provide healthcare services with tools that can reveal a possible new epidemic burden with a certain time anticipation, which is the main aim of the present study. Moreover, the sequence of law decrees to face the epidemic and the large amount of news generated in the population feelings of anxiety and suspicion. Considering this whole complex context, it is easily understandable how people ""overcrowded"" social media with messages dealing with the pandemic, and emergency numbers were overwhelmed by the calls. Thus, in order to find potential predictors of a possible second epidemic wave, we analyzed data both from Twitter and from emergency services comparing them to the daily infected time series at a regional level. Since our principal goal is to forecast a possible new ascending phase of the epidemic, we performed a wavelet analysis in the time-frequency plane, to finely discriminate over time the anticipation capability of the considered potential predictors. In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast a new burden. Since we analyzed aggregated regional data, and taking into account also the huge geographical heterogeneity of the epidemic spread, a future perspective would be to conduct the same analysis on a more local basis.",Bruno Alessandro Rivieccio; Alessandra Micheletti; Manuel Maffeo; Matteo Zignani; Alessandro Comunian; Federica Nicolussi; Silvia Salini; Giancarlo Manzi; Francesco Auxilia; Mauro Giudici; Giovanni Naldi; Sabrina Gaito; Silvana Castaldi; Elia Biganzoli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212415,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212415,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
344,Multi-organ impairment in low-risk individuals with long COVID,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has disproportionately affected older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. Research has focused on short-term outcomes in hospital, and single organ involvement. Consequently, impact of long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs in low-risk individuals is yet to be assessed.

MethodsAn ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study was performed in individuals symptomatic after recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms and organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) were assessed by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single and multi-organ impairment by consensus definitions.

FindingsBetween April and September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days after initial symptoms). The prevalence of pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) was low, and only 18% of individuals had been hospitalised with COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), and headaches (83%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) and gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms were common, and 42% of individuals had ten or more symptoms.

There was evidence of mild organ impairment in heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%). Single (66%) and multi-organ (25%) impairment was observed, and was significantly associated with risk of prior COVID-19 hospitalisation (p<0.05).

InterpretationIn a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.

345,A betacoronavirus multiplex microsphere immunoassay detects early SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and controls for pre-existing seasonal human coronavirus antibody cross-reactivity,"With growing concern of persistent or multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays remain critical for community and hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Here, we describe the development and application of a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MMIA) for COVD-19 antibody studies, utilizing serum samples from non-human primate SARS-CoV-2 infection models, an archived human sera bank and subjects enrolled at five U.S. military hospitals. The MMIA incorporates prefusion stabilized spike glycoprotein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the seasonal human coronaviruses HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, into a multiplexing system that enables simultaneous measurement of off-target pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. We report the sensitivity and specificity performances for this assay strategy at 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity for subject samples collected as early as 10 days after the onset of symptoms. In archival sera collected prior to 2019 and serum samples from subjects PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2, we detected seroprevalence of 72% and 98% for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-0C43, respectively. Requiring only 1.25 {micro}L of sera, this approach permitted the simultaneous identification of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, further demonstrating the presence of conserved epitopes in the spike glycoprotein of zoonotic betacoronaviruses. Application of this serology assay in observational studies with serum samples collected from subjects before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection will permit an investigation of the influences of HCoV-induced antibodies on COVID-19 clinical outcomes.",Eric D.

346,The effect of influenza vaccination on trained immunity: impact on COVID-19,"Every year, influenza causes 290.000 to 650.000 deaths worldwide and vaccination is encouraged to prevent infection in high-risk individuals. Interestingly, cross-protective effects of vaccination against heterologous infections have been reported, and long-term boosting of innate immunity (also termed trained immunity) has been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Several epidemiological studies also suggested cross-protection between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 during the current pandemic. However, the mechanism behind such an effect is unknown. Using an established in-vitro model of trained immunity, we demonstrate that the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine used in the Netherlands in the 2019-2020 influenza season can induce a trained immunity response, including an improvement of cytokine responses after stimulation of human immune cells with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was less common among Dutch hospital employees who had received influenza vaccination during the 2019/2020 winter season (RR = 0,61 (95% CI, 0.4585 - 0.8195, P = 0.001). In conclusion, a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can induce trained immunity responses against SARS-CoV-2, which may result in relative protection against COVID-19. These data, coupled with similar recent independent reports, argue for a beneficial effect of influenza vaccination against influenza as well as COVID-19, and suggests its effective deployment in the 2020-2021 influenza season to protect against both infections.",Priya A.

347,Early Prediction of COVID-19 Severity Using Extracellular Vesicles and Extracellular RNAs,"The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary broadly, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory failure and death. But the predictive biomarkers for characterizing the variability are still lacking. Since emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are functionally involved in a number of pathological processes, we hypothesize that these extracellular components may be key determinants and/or predictors of COVID-19 severity. To test our hypothesis, we collected serum samples from 31 patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms at the time of their admission. After standard therapy without corticosteroids, 9 of the 31 patients developed severe COVID-19 symptoms. We analyzed EV protein and exRNA profiles to look for correlations between these profiles and COVID-19 severity. Strikingly, we identified three distinct groups of markers (antiviral response-related EV proteins, coagulation-related markers, and liver damage-related exRNAs) with the potential to serve as early predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 severity. Among these markers, EV COPB2 has the best predictive value for severe deterioration of COVID-19 patients in this cohort. This type of information concerning functional extracellular component profiles could have great value for patient stratification and for making early clinical decisions about strategies for COVID-19 therapy.",Yu Fujita; Tokio Hoshina; Juntaro Matsuzaki; Tsukasa Kadota; Shota Fujimoto; Hironori Kawamoto; Naoaki Watanabe; Kenji Sawaki; Yohei Sakamoto; Makiko Miyajima; Kwangyole Lee; Kazuhiko Nakaharai; Tetsuya Horino; Ryo Nakagawa; Jun Araya; Mitsuru Miyato; Masaki Yoshida; Kazuyoshi Kuwano; Takahiro Ochiya,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212340,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212340,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
348,How to remove the testing bias in CoV-2 statistics,"BACKGROUNDPublic health measures and private behaviour are based on reported numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Some argue that testing influences the confirmed number of infections.

OBJECTIVES/METHODSDo time series on reported infections and the number of tests allow one to draw conclusions about actual infection numbers? A SIR model is presented where the true numbers of susceptible, infectious and removed individuals are unobserved. Testing is also modelled.

RESULTSOfficial confirmed infection numbers are likely to be biased and cannot be compared over time. The bias occurs because of different reasons for testing (e.g. by symptoms, representative or testing travellers). The paper illustrates the bias and works out the effect of the number of tests on the number of reported cases. The paper also shows that the positive rate (the ratio of positive tests to the total number of tests) is uninformative in the presence of non-representative testing.

CONCLUSIONSA severity index for epidemics is proposed that is comparable over time. This index is based on Covid-19 cases and can be obtained if the reason for testing is known.",Klaus Waelde,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212431,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212431,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,True
349,Drug synergy of combinatory treatment with remdesivir and the repurposed drugs fluoxetine and itraconazole effectively impairs SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"The SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urgently calls for efficient and safe antiviral treatment strategies. A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the host- SARS-CoV-2 interface via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs. We tested the antiviral potential of repurposing the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired viral replication was observed with all drug treatments. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.",Ursula Rescher; Sebastian Schloer; Linda Brunotte; Angeles Mecate-Zambrano; Shuyu Zheng; Jing Tang; Stephan Ludwig,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,False
350,Peptide vaccine candidate mimics the heterogeneity of natural SARS-CoV-2 immunity in convalescent humans and induces broad T cell responses in mice models,"We developed a global peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that addresses the dual challenges of heterogeneity in the immune responses of different individuals and potential heterogeneity of the infecting virus. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 is a polypeptide vaccine containing nine 30-mer peptides derived from all four major structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine peptides were selected based on their frequency as HLA class I and class II personal epitopes (PEPIs) restricted to multiple autologous HLA alleles of individuals in an in silico cohort of 433 subjects of different ethnicities. PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccine administered with Montanide ISA 51VG adjuvant generated robust, Th1-biased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against all four structural proteins of the virus, as well as binding antibodies upon subcutaneous injection into BALB/c and CD34+ transgenic mice. In addition, PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected ex vivo in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents blood investigated, 1-5 months after symptom onset. The PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific T cell repertoire used for recovery from COVID-19 was extremely diverse: donors had an average of seven different peptide-specific T cells, against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins; 87% of donors had multiple targets against at least three SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 53% against all four. In addition, PEPIs determined based on the complete HLA class I genotype of the convalescent donors were validated, with 84% accuracy, to predict PEPI-specific CD8+ T cell responses measured for the individuals. Extrapolation of the above findings to a US bone marrow donor cohort of 16,000 HLA-genotyped individuals with 16 different ethnicities (n=1,000 each ethnic group) suggest that PolyPEPI-SCoV-2 vaccination in a general population will likely elicit broad, multi-antigenic CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in 98% of individuals, independent of ethnicity, including Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) cohorts.",Eszter Somogyi; Zsolt Csiszovszki; Levente Molnár; Orsolya Lőrincz; József Tóth; Sofie Pattijn; Jana Schockaert; Aurélie Mazy; István Miklós; Katalin Pántya; Péter Páles; Enikő R.

351,Abnormal Antibodies to Self-Carbohydrates in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients,"SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly virus that is causing the global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our immune system plays a critical role in preventing, clearing, and treating the virus, but aberrant immune responses can contribute to deleterious symptoms and mortality. Many aspects of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are being investigated, but little is known about immune responses to carbohydrates. Since the surface of the virus is heavily glycosylated, pre-existing antibodies to glycans could potentially recognize the virus and influence disease progression. Furthermore, antibody responses to carbohydrates could be induced, affecting disease severity and clinical outcome. In this study, we used a carbohydrate antigen microarray with over 800 individual components to profile serum anti-glycan antibodies in COVID-19 patients and healthy control subjects. In COVID-19 patients, we observed abnormally high IgG and IgM antibodies to numerous self-glycans, including gangliosides, N-linked glycans, LacNAc-containing glycans, blood group H, and sialyl Lewis X. Some of these anti-glycan antibodies are known to play roles in autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders, which may help explain some of the unusual and prolonged symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. The detection of antibodies to self-glycans has important implications for using convalescent serum to treat patients, developing safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and understanding the risks of infection. In addition, this study provides new insight into the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and illustrates the importance of including host and viral carbohydrate antigens when studying immune responses to viruses.",Dorothy L.

352,Antibody Response to a Nucleocapsid Epitope as a Marker for COVID-19 Disease Severity,"Characterization of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to predict COVID-19 disease trajectories. Ineffective antibodies or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) could derail patients immune responses, for example. ELISA and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis epitope-mapped plasma from 86 COVID-19 patients. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including ICU stay, requirement for ventilators, and death. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate both with various comorbidities and ADE hallmarks, including increased IL-6 levels and early IgG response. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within five days post-symptom onset and sometimes within one day. The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 diagnostic for the early prediction of disease severity to guide more effective therapeutic interventions.

We quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the respiratory tract in parallel with antibodies and circulating T cells specific for various structural (NP, M, ORF3a and spike) and non-structural proteins (ORF7/8, NSP7 and NSP13). We observed that while rapid induction and quantity of humoral responses were associated with increased disease severity, an early induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells was present in patients with mild disease and accelerated viral clearance.

355,Duple extinguishment of COVID-19: single compound synergized inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication and direct suppression of inflammatory cytokines in vitro/vivo,"The virus replication and lung inflammation are basic targets for COVID-19 treatment. To effectively treat COVID-19, the best chemical drug should combine inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication and direct suppression of inflammatory cytokine expression together. Our SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) crystal structure studies revealed Au(I), derived from auranofin (AF) or gold cluster (GA), could specifically bind thiolate of Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. GA or AF could well inhibit Mpro activity and significantly decrease SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell. Cell studies showed that either AF or GA could down-regulate NF{kappa}B pathway, therefore significantly inhibit inflammatory cytokine level of IL-6, IL-1{beta}, TNF- in macrophage and bronchial epithelial cell, respectively. The lung viral load in GA treated COVID-19 mice (15mg/kg.bw) is significantly lower than that in normal saline (NS, 0.9% NaCl) treated COVID-19 mice, and pathological studies revealed GA treatment (score ~1.8) significantly reduced lung inflammatory injury compared with NS treated COVID-19 mice (score ~3). After normal mice were treated by GA (15mg/kg), the Au ingredient well distributed into lungs and there are no pathological changes in main organs when compared with control mice. The toxicity results revealed GA is more safety than auranofin for cell/mice/rat. The rat pharmacokinetics studies show GA is with high bioavailability (> 90%) in vivo.

356,Multivalency transforms SARS-CoV-2 antibodies into broad and ultrapotent neutralizers,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a global pandemic. Antibodies are powerful biotherapeutics to fight viral infections; however, discovery of the most potent and broadly acting clones can be lengthy. Here, we used the human apoferritin protomer as a modular subunit to drive oligomerization of antibody fragments and transform antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into exceptionally potent neutralizers. Using this platform, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as low as 9 x 10-14 M were achieved as a result of up to 10,000-fold potency enhancements. Combination of three different antibody specificities and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain on a single multivalent molecule conferred the ability to overcome viral sequence variability together with outstanding potency and Ig-like in vivo bioavailability. This MULTi-specific, multi-Affinity antiBODY (Multabody; or MB) platform contributes a new class of medical countermeasures against COVID-19 and an efficient approach to rapidly deploy potent and broadly-acting therapeutics against infectious diseases of global health importance.

357,"The Theory and Practice of the viral dose in neutralization assay: insights on SARS-CoV-2 ""doublethink"" effect.","Due to the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for reliable high-throughput serological assays in order to evaluate the immunological responses against SARS-COV-2 virus and to enable population screening, as well as vaccines and drugs efficacy testing. Several serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are now becoming available in the market. However, it has also become extremely important to have well-established assays with desirable high sensitivity and specificity. To date, the micro-neutralization (MN) assay, is currently considered the gold-standard being capable of evaluating and detecting, functional neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Several protocols exist for microneutralization assays which vary in several steps of the protocol: cell seeding conditions, number of cells seeded, virus amount used in the infection step, virus-serum-cells incubation period etc. These potential differences account for a high degree of variability and inconsistency of the results and using a harmonized protocol for the micro-neutralization assay could potentially solve this.

Given this situation, the main aim of our study was to carry out SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus MN assay in order to investigate which optimal tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) infective dose in use is the most adequate choice for implementation in terms of reproducibility, standardization possibilities and comparability of results. Therefore, we assessed the MN by using two different viral infective doses: a standard dose of 100 TCID50/well and a lower dose of 25 TCID50/well. The results obtained, yielded by MN on using the lower infective dose (25 TCID50), were in line with those obtained with the standard infective dose; in some cases, however, we detected a titre that was one or two dilution steps higher, which maintained all negative samples negative. This suggesting that the lower dose can potentially have a positive impact on the detection and estimation of neutralizing antibodies present in a given sample, showing higher sensitivity but similar specificity and therefore, it would require a more accurate assessment and cross-laboratories standardisation especially when MN is employed as serological assay of choice for pre-clinical and clinical studies.",Eleonora Molesti; Alessandro Manenti; Marta Maggetti; Giulia Lapini; Alessandro Torelli; Emanuele Montomoli,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342428,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342428,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,False
358,The effect of temperature and humidity on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses,"Since emerging in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, and it may become an endemic human pathogen. Understanding the impact of environmental conditions on SARS-CoV-2 viability and its transmission potential is crucial to anticipating epidemic dynamics and designing mitigation strategies. Ambient temperature and humidity are known to have strong effects on the environmental stability of viruses1, but there is little data for SARS-CoV-2, and a general quantitative understanding of how temperature and humidity affect virus stability has remained elusive. Here, we characterise the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at a variety of temperature and humidity conditions, and introduce a mechanistic model that enables accurate prediction of virus stability in unobserved conditions. We find that SARS-CoV-2 survives better at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities; median estimated virus half-life was more than 24 hours at 10 {degrees}C and 40 % RH, but approximately an hour and a half at 27 {degrees}C and 65 % RH. Our results highlight scenarios of particular transmission risk, and provide a mechanistic explanation for observed superspreading events in cool indoor environments such as food processing plants. Moreover, our model predicts observations from other human coronaviruses and other studies of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the existence of shared mechanisms that determine environmental stability across a number of enveloped viruses.",Dylan H.

359,Targeting androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 as a therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have an adverse effect on the progression of multiple cancers, including prostate cancer, due to the ensuing cytokine storm and associated oncogenic signaling. Epidemiological data showing increased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in men suggests a potential role for androgen in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we present evidence for the transcriptional regulation of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and co-receptor TMPRSS2 by androgen in mouse tissues and human prostate and lung cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. In an overexpression model, and the prostate and lung cells, Camostat - a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, required for viral fusion to the host cell. Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens such as enzalutamide/AR-PROTAC, or Camostat treatment attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry in lung and prostate cells. Together, our preclinical data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluations of the TMPRSS2 inhibitors, androgen-deprivation therapy and androgen receptor antagonists alone or in combination with anti-viral drugs as early as clinically possible to prevent inflammation driven COVID-19 progression.",Qu Deng; Reyaz ur Rasool; Ronnie M Russell; Ramakrishnan Natesan; Irfan A Asangani,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342782,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342782,2020-10-16,2020-10-16,,False
360,"Social contact patterns among employees in 3 U.S. companies during early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, April to June 2020.","2.ImportanceDevising control strategies against diseases such as COVID-19 require understanding of contextual social mixing and contact patterns. There has been no standardized multi-site social contact study conducted in workplace settings in the United States that can be used to broadly inform pandemic preparedness policy in these settings.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to characterize the patterns of social contacts and mixing across workplace environments, including on-site or when teleworking.

DesignThis was a cross-sectional non-probability survey that used standardized social contact diaries to collect data. Employees were requested to record their physical and non-physical contacts in a diary over two consecutive days, documented at the end of each day. Employees from each company were enrolled through email and electronic diaries sent as individual links. Data were collected from April to June 2020.

SettingTwo multinational consulting companies and one university administrative department, all located in Georgia, USA.

ParticipantsEmployees opted into the study by accepting the invitation on a link sent via email.

Main OutcomeThe outcome was median number of contacts per person per day. This was stratified by day of data collection, age, sex, race and ethnicity.

ResultsOf 3,835 employees approached, 357 (9.3%) completed the first day of contact diary of which 304 completed both days of contact diary. There was a median of 2 contacts (IQR: 1-4, range: 0-21) per respondent on both day one and two. The majority (55%) of contacts involved conversation only, occurred at home (64%), and cumulatively lasted more than 4 hours (38%). Most contacts were repeated, and within same age groups, though participants aged 30-59 years reported substantial inter-generational mixing with children.

ConclusionParticipating employees in 3 surveyed workplaces reported few contacts, similar to studies from the UK and China when shelter-in-place orders were in effect during the pandemic. Many contacts were repeated which may limit the spread of infection.

361,IgM autoantibodies recognizing ACE2 are associated with severe COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe disease in a subpopulation of patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate robust IgM autoantibodies that recognize angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in 18/66 (27%) patients with severe COVID-19, which are rare (2/52; 3.8%) in hospitalized patients who are not ventilated. The antibodies do not undergo class-switching to IgG, suggesting a T-independent antibody response. Purified IgM from anti-ACE2 patients activates complement. Pathological analysis of lung obtained at autopsy shows endothelial cell staining for IgM in blood vessels in some patients. We propose that vascular endothelial ACE2 expression focuses the pathogenic effects of these autoantibodies on blood vessels, and contributes to the angiocentric pathology observed in some severe COVID-19 patients.

A recent mathematical model has suggested that staying at home did not play a dominant role in reducing COVID-19 transmission. Comparison between number of deaths and social mobility is difficult due to the non-stationary nature of the COVID-19 data.

ObjectiveTo propose a novel approach to assess the association between staying at home values and the reduction/increase in the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in several regions around the world.

MethodsIn this ecological study, data from www.google.com/covid19/mobility/, ourworldindata.org and covid.saude.gov.br were combined. Countries with >100 deaths and with a Healthcare Access and Quality Index of [&ge;]67 were included. Data were preprocessed and analyzed using the difference between number of deaths/million between 2 regions and the difference between the percentage of staying at home.

366,Sociodemographic correlates of access to sanitary pads among college students in Lucknow during COVID 19 lockdown,"IntroductionSanitary napkin is an essential aspect of the Menstrual management materials for women and adolescent girls between menarche and menopause. Despite being an important issue concerning women and girls in the menstruating age group, access to menstrual hygiene products neglected during the COVID19 pandemic. Further, there is no evidence of the practice of menstrual hygiene products in Indian settings during this period. This paper investigates the prevalence of socio-demographic correlations of access to sanitary napkins among college students in Lucknow.

MethodsAn online retrospective cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lucknow in September 2020. In total, 1439 participants took part in the survey. After removing 55 participants, those quit the survey by clicking on the disagree button and 13 were not satisfying inclusion criteria. So the final samples were 1371, which were included in the analysis. Students of UG and PG currently studying in colleges in the Lucknow were eligible to participate. The data collection was anonymous. Responses were analysed using descriptive and bivariate logistic regression.

ResultsIn this study, 1371 students were included, making a response rate of 96.2 percent. Nearly 12.5 percent of students reported about difficulty encountered during the lockdown. Muslims, Father education illiterate or upto12th, father occupation as farmer, monthly salary less than 25 thousand, residence as rural, and history of reusable clothes were more likely to face problems to access sanitary pads during the lockdown in Lucknow (P < .05).

ConclusionsDuring COVID-19 lockdown, about 12.5 % of girls were dependent on either locally available resources as absorbents during menstruation or paid more to access in Lucknow. Because of the lockdown, many people have lost their livelihood. More than ever, economically low-income families are reluctant to spend on sanitary pads, which is why few college girls were going back to their previous handling periods by using rags.

367,"Characteristics and Factors Associated with COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization, and Mortality Across Race and Ethnicity","BackgroundData on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients disaggregated by race/ethnicity remain limited. We evaluated the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients across the major racial/ethnic groups and assessed their associations with COVID-19 outcomes.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study analyzed patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in a large, integrated health system spanning California, Oregon, and Washington between March 1 and August 30, 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic health records. Odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and in-hospital death were assessed with multivariate logistic regression.

Findings289,294 patients with known race/ethnicity were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, of whom 27.5% were non-White minorities. 15,605 persons tested positive, with minorities representing 58.0%. Disparities were widest among Hispanics, who represented 40.5% of infections but 12.8% of those tested. Hispanics were generally younger and had fewer comorbidities except diabetes than White patients. Of the 3,197 patients hospitalized, 58.9% were non-White. 459 patients died, of whom 49.8% were minorities. Racial/ethnic distributions of outcomes across the health system tracked with state-level statistics. Increase odds of testing positive and hospitalization were associated with all minority races/ethnicities except American Indian/Alaska Native. Highest odds of testing SARS-CoV-2 positive was for Hispanic patients (OR [95% CI]: 3.68 [3.52-3.84]) and highest odds of COVID-19 hospitalization was for Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander patients (2.13 [1.48 - 3.06]). Hispanic patients also exhibited increased morbidity including need for mechanical ventilation. In multivariate modeling, Hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with increased odds of hospital mortality (1.75 [1.15-2.67]) among patients over age 70, but hospital mortality was not increased for any race/ethnicity sub-population in the multivariate model.

InterpretationMajor healthcare disparities were evident, especially among Hispanics who tested positive at a higher rate, and despite younger in age, required excess hospitalization and need for mechanical ventilation compared to their expected demographic proportions. As characteristics of patients varying between race/ethnicity, targeted, culturally-responsive interventions are needed to address the increased risk of poor outcomes among minority populations with COVID-19.

368,Development of a deep learning classifier to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from look-a-like pathology on lung ultrasound,"ObjectivesLung ultrasound (LUS) is a portable, low cost respiratory imaging tool but is challenged by user dependence and lack of diagnostic specificity. It is unknown whether the advantages of LUS implementation could be paired with deep learning techniques to match or exceed human-level, diagnostic specificity among similar appearing, pathological LUS images.

DesignA convolutional neural network was trained on LUS images with B lines of different etiologies. CNN diagnostic performance, as validated using a 10% data holdback set was compared to surveyed LUS-competent physicians.

SettingTwo tertiary Canadian hospitals.

Participants600 LUS videos (121,381 frames) of B lines from 243 distinct patients with either 1) COVID-19, Non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome (NCOVID) and 3) Hydrostatic pulmonary edema (HPE).

ResultsThe trained CNN performance on the independent dataset showed an ability to discriminate between COVID (AUC 1.0), NCOVID (AUC 0.934) and HPE (AUC 1.0) pathologies. This was significantly better than physician ability (AUCs of 0.697, 0.704, 0.967 for the COVID, NCOVID and HPE classes, respectively), p < 0.01.

ConclusionsA deep learning model can distinguish similar appearing LUS pathology, including COVID-19, that cannot be distinguished by humans.

369,Physical Activity Decreases the Prevalence of COVID-19-associated Hospitalization: Brazil EXTRA Study,"ObjectivesWe compared physical activity levels before the outbreak and quarantine measures with COVID-19-associated hospitalization prevalence in surviving patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we investigated the association of physical activity levels with symptoms of the disease, length of hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation.

MethodsBetween June 2020 and August 2020, we invited Brazilian survivors and fully recovered patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to respond to an online questionnaire. We shared the electronic link to the questionnaire on the internet. In this cross-sectional study, we collected data about clinical outcomes (symptoms, medications, hospitalization, and length of hospital stay) and cofactors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, preexisting diseases, socioeconomic and educational, and physical activity levels using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short version).

ResultsOut of 938 patients, 91 (9.7%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. In a univariate analysis, sex, age, and BMI were all associated with hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Men had a higher prevalence of hospitalization (66.6%, P=0.013). Patients older than 65 years, obese, and with preexisting disease had a higher prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. In a multivariate regression model, performance of at least 150 min/wk (moderate) and/or 75 min/wk (vigorous) physical activity was associated with a lower prevalence of hospitalizations after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and preexisting diseases (PR=0.657; P=0.046).

ConclusionsSufficient physical activity levels are associated with a lower prevalence of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Performing at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity physical activity reduces this prevalence by 34.3%.

370,Heterogeneity in transmissibility and shedding SARS-CoV-2 via droplets and aerosols,"A growing number of studies provide insight into how SARS-CoV-2 spreads1-7. Yet, many factors that characterize its transmissibility remain unclear, including mechanistic correlates of overdispersion, viral kinetics, the extent to which respiratory droplets and aerosols carry viable virus and the infectiousness of asymptomatic, presymptomatic and pediatric cases7. Here, we developed a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads (rVLs) via systematic review and investigated these factors using meta-analyses and modeling. By comparing cases of COVID-19, SARS and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, we found that heterogeneity in rVL was associated with overdispersion and facilitated the distinctions in individual variation in infectiousness among these emergent diseases. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity was broad throughout the infectious period, although rVL tended to peak at 1 day from symptom onset (DFSO) and be elevated for 1-5 DFSO. While most cases presented minimal risk, highly infectious ones could spread SARS-CoV-2 by talking, singing or breathing, which shed virions at comparable rates via droplets and aerosols. Coughing shed considerable quantities of virions, predominantly via droplets, and greatly increased the contagiousness of many symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones. Asymptomatic and symptomatic infections showed similar likelihoods of expelling aerosols with SARS-CoV-2, as did adult and pediatric cases. Children tended to be less contagious by droplet spread than adults based on tendencies of symptomatology rather than rVL. Our findings address longstanding questions on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and present pertinent considerations for disease control.",Paul Z Chen; Niklas Bobrovitz; Zahra Premji; Marion Koopmans; David N Fisman; Frank X Gu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212233,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212233,2020-10-15,2020-10-15,,True
371,Repurposed antiviral drugs for COVID-19; interim WHO SOLIDARITY trial results,"BACKGROUNDWHO expert groups recommended mortality trials in hospitalized COVID-19 of four re-purposed antiviral drugs.

METHODSStudy drugs were Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir (fixed-dose combination with Ritonavir) and Interferon-{beta}1a (mainly subcutaneous; initially with Lopinavir, later not). COVID-19 inpatients were randomized equally between whichever study drugs were locally available and open control (up to 5 options: 4 active and local standard-of-care). The intent-to-treat primary analyses are of in-hospital mortality in the 4 pairwise comparisons of each study drug vs its controls (concurrently allocated the same management without that drug, despite availability). Kaplan-Meier 28-day risks are unstratified; log-rank death rate ratios (RRs) are stratified for age and ventilation at entry.

RESULTSIn 405 hospitals in 30 countries 11,266 adults were randomized, with 2750 allocated Remdesivir, 954 Hydroxychloroquine, 1411 Lopinavir, 651 Interferon plus Lopinavir, 1412 only Interferon, and 4088 no study drug. Compliance was 94-96% midway through treatment, with 2-6% crossover. 1253 deaths were reported (at median day 8, IQR 4-14). Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 12% (39% if already ventilated at randomization, 10% otherwise). Death rate ratios (with 95% CIs and numbers dead/randomized, each drug vs its control) were: Remdesivir RR=0.95 (0.81-1.11, p=0.50; 301/2743 active vs 303/2708 control), Hydroxychloroquine RR=1.19 (0.89-1.59, p=0.23; 104/947 vs 84/906), Lopinavir RR=1.00 (0.79-1.25, p=0.97; 148/1399 vs 146/1372) and Interferon RR=1.16 (0.96-1.39, p=0.11; 243/2050 vs 216/2050). No study drug definitely reduced mortality (in unventilated patients or any other subgroup of entry characteristics), initiation of ventilation or hospitalisation duration.

CONCLUSIONSThese Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. The mortality findings contain most of the randomized evidence on Remdesivir and Interferon, and are consistent with meta-analyses of mortality in all major trials. (Funding: WHO.

372,A high throughput RNA displacement assay for screening SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex towards developing therapeutics for COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, evades the human immune system by capping its RNA. This process protects the viral RNA and is essential for its replication. Multiple viral proteins are involved in this RNA capping process including the nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) which is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent 2-O-methyltransferase. Nsp16 is significantly active when in complex with another nonstructural protein, nsp10, which plays a key role in its stability and activity. Here we report the development of a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based RNA displacement assay for nsp10-nsp16 complex in 384-well format with a Z'-Factor of 0.6, suitable for high throughput screening. In this process, we purified the nsp10-nsp16 complex to higher than 95% purity and confirmed its binding to the methyl donor SAM, product of the reaction, SAH, and a common methyltransferase inhibitor, sinefungin using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). The assay was further validated by screening a library of 1124 drug-like compounds.

373,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in vitro upon blocking N- and O-glycan elaboration,"The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, its receptor binding domain (RBD), and its primary receptor ACE2 are extensively glycosylated. The impact of this post-translational modification on viral entry is yet unestablished. We expressed different glycoforms of the Spike-protein and ACE2 in CRISPR-Cas9 glycoengineered cells, and developed corresponding SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding. However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spike-protein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2 and decreasing viral entry. Overall, chemical inhibitors of glycosylation may be evaluated for COVID-19.",Qi Yang; Thomas A. Hughes; Anju Kelkar; Xinheng Yu; Kai Cheng; Sheldon J. Park; We-Chiao Huang; Jonathan F.

Understanding this communication at the molecular level in intact tissue requires new methods. The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in acute respiratory distress, thrombosis and death, has been studied primarily in accessible liquid specimens such as blood, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage, all of which are peripheral to the primary site of infection in the lung. Here, we describe the combined use of multiplexed deep proteomics with multiplexed imaging to profile infection and its sequelae directly in fixed lung tissue specimens obtained from necropsy of infected animals and autopsy of human decedents. We characterize multiple steps in disease response from cytokine accumulation and protein phosphorylation to activation of receptors, changes in signaling pathways, and crosslinking of fibrin to form clots. Our data reveal significant differences between naturally resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques and lethal COVID-19 in humans. The approach we describe is broadly applicable to other tissues and diseases.

375,The Strand-biased Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 and Unbalanced Inhibition by Remdesivir,"SARS-CoV-2, a positive single-stranded RNA virus, caused the COVID-19 pandemic. During the viral replication and transcription, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) ""jumps"" along the genome template, resulting in discontinuous negative-stranded transcripts. In other coronaviruses, the negative strand RNA was found functionally relevant to the activation of host innate immune responses. Although the sense-mRNA architectures of SARS-CoV-2 were reported, its negative strand was unexplored. Here, we deeply sequenced both strands of RNA and found SARS-CoV-2 transcription is strongly biased to form the sense strand. During negative strand synthesis, apart from canonical sub-genomic ORFs, numerous non-canonical fusion transcripts are formed, driven by 3-15 nt sequence homology scattered along the genome but more prone to be inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase inhibitor Remdesivir. The drug also represses more of the negative than the positive strand synthesis as supported by a mathematic simulation model and experimental quantifications. Overall, this study opens new sights into SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis and may facilitate the anti-viral vaccine development and drug design.

Give that COVID-19 vaccine development is currently a major focus of the world, there is a lack of understanding of how background immunity influence antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. This study provides evidence for antigenic imprinting in Sarbecovirus, which is the subgenus that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to. Specifically, we sequentially immunized mice with two antigenically distinct Sarbecovirus strains, namely SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We found that the neutralizing antibodies triggered by the sequentially immunization are dominantly against the one that is used for priming.

377,Systematic analysis of innate immune antagonism reveals vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2,"The innate immune system efficiently defends the human host against viral pathogens. Thus, viruses evolved strategies to counteract immune activation. Here, we systematically analysed the impact of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins on three major arms of our cell-intrinsic innate immune defences: interferon (IFN) induction, cytokine signalling and autophagy. Subsequent mechanistic analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins target the respective signalling cascades at multiple steps. For example, we show that Nsp14 reduces endogenous IFN receptor levels and ORF3a and ORF7a perturb the late endosomal/trans-Golgi network. Our data demonstrates that most antagonistic activities are conserved between proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the closely related bat RaTG13-CoV and the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1. However, SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is strikingly more potent in suppressing IFN induction and signalling than its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. This may help explain the lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitated its rapid spread. Overall our analyses revealed that IFN-{gamma} and IFN-{lambda}1 signalling are antagonised the least, leaving SARS-CoV-2 highly susceptible to these two cytokines. Their combination synergistically potentiated the anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Taken together, our results allow an explanation for differences in susceptibility towards IFNs and provide evidence that rational immune activation may be an effective future therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2.",Manuel Hayn; Maximilian Hirschenberger; Lennart Koepke; Jan Hendrik Straub; Rayhane Nchioua; Susanne Klute; Caterina Prelli Bozzo; Wasim Aftab; Fabian Zech; Carina Conzelmann; Janis Alexander Mueller; Smitha Srinivasachar Badarinarayan; Christina Martina Stuerzel; Ignasi Forne; Steffen Stenger; Karl-Klaus Conzelmann; Jan Muench; Daniel Sauter; Axel Imhof; Frank Kirchhoff; Konstantin Maria Johannes Sparrer,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.340612,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.340612,2020-10-15,2020-10-15,,False

Rapid and comprehensive analysis of both pathogen and host sequencing data is critical to track infection and inform therapies. In this study, we performed unbiased metatranscriptomic analysis of clinical samples from COVID-19 patients using a newly-developed RNA-seq library construction method (TRACE-seq), which utilizes tagmentation activity of Tn5 on RNA/DNA hybrids. This approach avoids the laborious and time-consuming steps in traditional RNA-seq procedure, and hence is fast, sensitive and convenient.

379,Quantitative Assays Reveal Cell Fusion at Minimal Levels of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Fusion-from-Without,"Cell entry of the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by its spike protein S. As main antigenic determinant, S protein is in focus of antibody-based prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Besides particle-cell fusion, S mediates fusion between infected and uninfected cells resulting in syncytia formation. Here we present quantitative assay systems covering not only particle-cell and cell-cell fusion, but also demonstrating fusion-from-without (FFWO), the formation of syncytia induced by S-containing viral particles in absence of newly synthesized S protein. Based on complementation of split {beta}-galactosidase and virus-like-particles (VLPs) displaying S protein, this assay can be performed at BSL-1. All three assays provided readouts with a high dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratios covering several orders of magnitude. The data obtained confirm the enhancing effect of trypsin and overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on membrane fusion. Neutralizing antibodies as well as sera from convalescent patients inhibited particle-cell fusion with high efficiency. Cell-cell fusion, in contrast, was only moderately inhibited despite requiring much lower levels of S protein, which were below the detection limit of flow cytometry and Western blot. The data indicate that syncytia formation as a pathological consequence in tissues of Covid-19 patients can proceed at low levels of S protein and may not be effectively prevented by antibodies.",Samuel A.

380,A Common Methodological Phylogenomics Framework for intra-patient heteroplasmies to infer SARS-CoV-2 sublineages and tumor clones,"We present a common methodological framework to infer the phylogenomics from genomic data, be it reads of SARS-CoV-2 of multiple COVID-19 patients or bulk DNAseq of the tumor of a cancer patient. The commonality is in the phylogenetic retrodiction based on the genomic reads in both scenarios. While there is evidence of heteroplasmy, i.e., multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the same COVID-19 patient; to date, there is no evidence of sublineages recombining within the same patient. The heterogeneity in a patients tumor is analogous to intra-patient heteroplasmy and the absence of recombination in the cells of tumor is a widely accepted assumption. Just as the different frequencies of the genomic variants in a tumor presupposes the existence of multiple tumor clones and provides a handle to computationally infer them, we postulate that so do the different variant frequencies in the viral reads, offering the means to infer the multiple co-infecting sublineages. We describe the Concerti computational framework for inferring phylogenies in each of the two scenarios. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reproduce some known results in both scenarios. We also make some additional discoveries. We uncovered new potential parallel mutation in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies towards the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this study, we present the design of a lipid nanoparticles (LNP)-encapsulated receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA vaccine. Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulation have been chosen for the subsequent RBD mRNA vaccine experiment. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD mRNA elicited robust humoral response, high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice.

382,"Predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Athens, Greece","BackgroundThe epidemic of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide, with millions of confirmed cases and related deaths. Numerous efforts are being made to clarify how the infection progresses and potential factors associated with disease severity and mortality. We investigated the mortality in Greek hospitalized COVID-19 patients and also the predictors of this mortality.

MethodsStudy population included 512 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals of the Attica region of Greece. Patients demographic characteristics, comorbidities, allergies, previous vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, admission to ICU, intubation, and death were recorded. Potential predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified by regression analysis.

ResultsThe mean age of hospitalized patients was 60.4 years, and was higher in patients who deceased. The most common comorbidities were respiratory diseases, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, dyslipidemia, mental health diseases, asthma, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The need for ICU care and intubation was significantly higher among patients who died. The mortality rate was 15.8% (81 out of 512). Age [&ge;]65 years, cancer, chronic kidney disease, endocrine diseases, central nervous system disorders, anemia, and intubation were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality, while allergies and previous influenza vaccination were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality.

ConclusionOur finding of a beneficial effect of allergies and influenza vaccination against COVID-19 infection merits further investigation, as it may shed light in the mechanisms underlying disease progression and severity. Most importantly, it may assist in the implementation of efficient protective measures and public healthcare policies.",Dimitrios Giannoglou; Evangelia Meimeti; Xenia Provatopoulou; Kostantinos Stathopoulos; Kriton-Ioannis Roukas; Petros Galanis,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211193,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211193,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
383,Should international borders re-open? The impact of travel restrictions on COVID-19 importation risk,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread across the world at an unprecedented pace, reaching over 200 countries and territories in less than three months. In response, many governments denied entry to travellers arriving from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19 importations. Here we develop a comprehensive framework to model daily COVID-19 importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35) between January and June 2020. The presented framework can further be used to gain insights into how many importations to expect should borders re-open. Authorities may consider the presented information when planning a phased re-opening of international borders.",Jessica Liebig; Kamran Najeebullah; Raja Jurdak; Ahmad El Shoghri; Dean Paini,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20211060,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20211060,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
384,"Awareness, Perception and Practice Of COVID 19 Prevention among Residents of a State in the South-South Region Of Nigeria: Implications for Public Health Control Efforts","BackgroundThis research explored awareness, perception, and practice of COVID 19 prevention among residents of communities in all the local government areas (districts) in Rivers State during the early stages of the pandemic response.

DesignThis was a descriptive cross-sectional survey which employed an interviewer-administered four-page questionnaire built into the Open Data Kit application for android phones. Knowledge and practice scores were computed by scoring every correct response/action as 1 and wrong responses as 0. Knowledge was graded as excellent for scores of [&ge;]80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of <50%. Respondents who washed all critical parts of the hand were categorized as having correct handwashing practice.

SettingRivers State in the South-South region of Nigeria had recorded over 2000 cases of COVID 19 as of 18th August 2020, ranking 5th among the high burden states in Nigeria. As with any epidemic of an infectious nature, panic, fear, and misconceptions are rife. Risk communication utilizes multi-faceted activities geared towards facilitating correct and consistent knowledge and prevention practice.

ParticipantsStudy involved 1,294 adult community residents in the 23 districts of the state.

ResultsThe respondents were aged between 18 and 80 years with average age of 39.6 years (SD = 11.9 years). A total of 710 (54.9%) were male, 476 (36.8%) were unemployed with 685 (52.9%) having secondary education. Almost all respondents 1,271 (98.2%) had heard about COVID 19. The three most common sources of information about COVID 19 were radio jingles 1102 (86.7%), television adverts 940 (74.0%) and announcements in Church 612 (48.2%). Overall, 608 (47.0%) of the respondents had poor knowledge of COVID 19. About 1167 (90.2%) of the respondents who were aware of COVID 19 acknowledged that COVID 19 is a problem in the state while 443 (34.9%) respondents believed they were unlikely contract the virus. Only 505 (39.0%) of the respondents washed all critical parts of the hand correctly.

385,Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community-based population: Results from an epidemiological study,"BackgroundPrior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods.

MethodsWe pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide seroprevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsAmong 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR=5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR=4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR=2.38, p=0.006), and cough (OR=2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection.

ConclusionsSymptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSUsing multiple journal articles queried from MEDLINE as well as a Cochrane systematic review, we examined all studies that described symptoms known to be associated with COVID-19. We further examined the guidelines from WHO and CDC on the symptoms those public health authorities consider to be associated with COVID-19. Most of the evidence comes from China, Italy, and the United States. Collectively prior research and guidance suggests there are a dozen symptoms reported by individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in multiple countries. Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, shortness of breath, chills, myalgias, headache, sore throat, chest pain, and gastrointestinal issues. The evidence is generally of low quality as it is descriptive in nature, and it is biased towards hospitalized patients. Most studies report the proportion of patients hospitalized or testing positive for infection who report one or more symptoms within 3-14 days prior to hospitalization or infection. There has been little validation of symptoms among hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. Furthermore, according to a Cochrane review, no studies to date assess combinations of different signs and symptoms.

Added value of this studyThis study employs multiple, rigorous methods to examine the ability of specific symptoms as well as symptom combinations/groups to predict laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR) infection of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the study is unique in its large sample drawn exclusively from community-based populations rather than hospitalized patients.

Implication of all the available evidenceCombining the evidence from this study with prior research suggests that anosmia and ageusia are key symptoms that differentiate COVID-19 from influenza-like symptoms. Clinical screening protocols for COVID-19 should look for these symptoms, which are not commonly asked of patients who present to urgent care or hospital with flu-like symptoms.

Key pointsImportant symptoms specific to COVID-19 are fever, anosmia, ageusia, and cough. Two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), yet most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. This study confirms using robust methods the key symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, and it also identifies combinations of symptoms strongly associated with positive infection",Brian E Dixon; Kara Wools-Kaloustian; William F Fadel; Thomas J Duszynski; Constantin Yiannoutsos; Paul K Halverson; Nir Menachemi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210922,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

387,"High Food Insecurity in Latinx Families and Associated COVID-19 Infection in the Greater Bay Area, California","BackgroundFood insecurity impacts nearly one-in-four Latinx households in the United States and has been exacerbated by the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe examined the impact of COVID-19 on household and child food security in three preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx urban cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area (N=375 households, 1,875 individuals). Households were initially recruited during pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF Benioff prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For this COVID sub-study, participants responded to a 15-minute telephonic interview. Participants answered 18 questions from the US Food Security Food Module (US HFSSM), described food consumption, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection as per community or hospital-based testing. Food security and insecurity levels were compared with prior year metrics.

ResultsWe found low levels of household food security in Latinx families (by cohort: 29.2%; 34.2%; 60.0%) and child food security (56.9%; 54.1%; 78.0%) with differences between cohorts explained by self-reported levels of education and employment status. Food security levels were much lower than those reported previously in two cohorts where data had been recorded from prior years. Reported history of COVID-19 infection in households was 4.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI); 1.5-14.3%); 7.2% (95%CI; 3.6-13.9%) and 3.5% (95%CI; 1.7-7.2%) by cohort and was associated with food insecurity in the two larger cohorts (p=0.03; p=0.01 respectively).

ConclusionsLatinx families in the Bay Area with children are experiencing a sharp rise in food insecurity levels during the COVID-19 epidemic. Food insecurity, similar to other indices of poverty, is associated with increased risk for COVID-19 infection. Comprehensive interventions are needed to address food insecurity in Latinx populations and further studies are needed to better assess independent associations between household food insecurity, poor nutritional health and risk of COVID-19 infection.",Milagro Escobar; Andrea DeCastro Mendez; Maria Romer Encinas; Janet Wojcicki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210906,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210906,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

389,COVID-CT-Mask-Net: Prediction of COVID-19 from CT Scans Using Regional Features,"We present COVID-CT-Mask-Net model that predicts COVID-19 from CT scans. The model works in two stages: first, it detects the instances of ground glass opacity and consolidation in CT scans, then predicts the condition from the ranked bounding box detections. To develop the solution for the three-class problem (COVID, common pneumonia and control), we used the COVIDx-CT dataset derived from the dataset of CT scans collected by China National Center for Bioinformation. We use about 5% of the training split of COVIDx-CT to train the model, and without any complicated data normalization, balancing and regularization, and training only a small fraction of the models parameters, we achieve a 90.80% COVID sensitivity, 91.62% common pneumonia sensitivity and 92.10% normal sensitivity, and an overall accuracy of 91.66% on the test data (21182 images), bringing the ratio of test/train data to 7.06, which implies a very high capacity of the model to generalize to new data. We also establish an important result, that ranked regional predictions (bounding boxes with scores) in Mask R-CNN can be used to make accurate predictions of the image class.

391,CORRELATION BETWEEN SARS-COV-2 ANTIBODY SCREENING BY IMMUNOASSAY AND NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY TESTING,"BackgroundPassive antibody therapy with convalescent plasma (CP) represents a promising alternative for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The efficacy of CP therapy has been associated with high titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in the plasma of recovered patients, but the assays for quantifying nAbs are not widely available. Our goal was to develop a strategy to predict high titers of nAbs based on the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays and the clinical characteristics of the CP potential donors.

MethodsTwo hundred and fourteen CP donors were enrolled and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two commercial immunoassays (IA): Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG EUROIMMUN and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Chemiluminescence IgG Abbott. In parallel, quantification of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) was performed using the Cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-VNT). Three criteria for identifying donors with high titers of nAbs ([&ge;]1:160) were tested: - Criterion1: Curve ROC Method; - Criterion 2: Conditional decision tree considering only the results from the IA and -Criterion 3: Conditional decision tree including both the IA results and the clinical variables.

ResultsThe performance of Abbott and EUROIMMUN immunoassays was similar referring to both S/CO and predictive value for identifying nAbs titers [&ge;] 1:160. Regarding the three studied criteria for identifying CP donors with high nAbs titers ([&ge;] 1:160): 1) Criterion 1 showed 76.1% accuracy when the S/CO cut-off of 4.65 was used, 2) Criterion 2 presented 76.1% accuracy if the S/CO [&ge;] 4.57 was applied and 3) Criterion 3 had 71.6% accuracy if either S/CO [&ge;] 4.57 or S/CO between 2.68 and 4.57 and the last COVID-19-related symptoms occurred less than 19 days from donor recruiting were used.

ConclusionThe results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (S/CO) can be used to predict high nAbs titers of potential CP donors. This study has proposed three different criteria for identifying donors with [&ge;] 1:160 nAbs titer based on either solely S/CO results or S/CO together with clinical variables, all with high efficacy and accuracy.",ALFREDO MENDRONE-JUNIOR; CARLA DINARDO; SUZETE FERREIRA; ANNA NISHIA; NANCI SALLES; CESAR ALMEIDA-NETO; DEBORA HAMASAKI; TILA FACINCANI; LUCAS ALVES; RAFAEL MACHADO; DANIELLE ARAUJO; EDISON DURIGON; VANDERSON ROCHA; ESTER SABINO,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210005,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210005,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
392,"School education during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - Which concept is safe, feasible and environmentally sound?","OverviewThe future belongs to children and they need education to shape the future with foresight and intention. Children therefore have the right to education, according to Article 29 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child [1]. However, professional education is not everything, because children must also experience their strengths and weaknesses together and educate each other to be responsible and considerate people, so that they become socially valuable personalities. Only in this way can they shape the future in a peaceful and humane way. Therefore, attending school is essential. However, children also have the right to protection and care by their parents and the state, because the welfare of the child must also be given priority in accordance with Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The question is therefore how schooling in community schools can be realized during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without exposing children to an unnecessary risk of infection. It is not only about the children, because if the children are at risk, then so are their parents and grandparents and ultimately society as a whole. There are numerous concepts that promise safety in schools during the pandemic. When selecting concepts, the costs must of course be weighed against the benefits. People rightly expect an efficient use of resources. This means that either the set goal is achieved with the least possible resources or that the available resources are used to achieve the greatest possible approximation to the goal. In addition to the financial resources, however, the long-term consequences for the state, the economy, the population and the environment under the pressure of the pandemic must also be taken into account. Social cohesion and democracy must not be jeopardized either. Various protection concepts are currently under discussion. Often the advantages are overstated and the disadvantages concealed. Furthermore, some arguments are based on assumptions that are not true. The aim of this study is to provide a comparative assessment of the main protection concepts and to demonstrate, with the help of experimental analyses, the extent to which the protection concepts are effective. We will show that a comparatively high level of safety against infection in classrooms can be technically ensured without exposing children to masks. At the same time, the protection concept makes economic sense and the burden on the environment is comparatively low, so that infection prevention and climate protection do not have to be weighed against each other, because infection prevention and climate protection are political and social goals that have to be achieved together.",Christian J.

393,High and increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity in England during end September beginning October 2020: REACT-1 round 5 updated report,"BackgroundREACT-1 is quantifying prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among random samples of the population in England based on PCR testing of self-administered nose and throat swabs. Here we report results from the fifth round of observations for swabs collected from the 18th September to 5th October 2020. This report updates and should be read alongside our round 5 interim report.

MethodsRepresentative samples of the population aged 5 years and over in England with sample size ranging from 120,000 to 175,000 people at each round. Prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimation of reproduction number (R) and time trends between and within rounds using exponential growth or decay models.

Results175,000 volunteers tested across England between 18th September and 5th October. Findings show a national prevalence of 0.60% (95% confidence interval 0.55%, 0.71%) and doubling of the virus every 29 (17, 84) days in England corresponding to an estimated national R of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27). These results correspond to 1 in 170 people currently swab-positive for the virus and approximately 45,000 new infections each day. At regional level, the highest prevalence is in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and the North East with strongest regional growth in North West, Yorkshire and The Humber and West Midlands.

ConclusionRapid growth has led to high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England, with highest rates in the North of England. Prevalence has increased in all age groups, including those at highest risk.

MethodsWe undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30 days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant performance using the validation set.

ResultsWe analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance status, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97-0.98) and specificity 0.38 (0.38-0.39) for scores above four points.

ConclusionA clinical score based on NEWS2, age, sex, and performance status predicts adverse outcome with good discrimination in adults with suspected COVID-19 and can be used to support decision-making in emergency care.

395,Understanding the Los Angeles County Coronavirus Epidemic: The Critical Role of Intrahousehold Transmission,"We tracked the course of the COVID-19 epidemic among the approximately 300 communities comprising Los Angeles County. The epidemic, we found, had three distinct phases. During Phase I, from early March through about April 4, initial seeding of infection in relatively affluent areas was followed by radial geographic extension to adjoining communities. During Phase II, lasting until about July 11, COVID-19 cases continued to rise at a slower rate, and became increasingly concentrated in four geographic foci of infection across the county. Those communities with larger reductions in social mobility during April - as measured by the proportion of smartphones staying at home and number of smartphones visiting a gym - reported fewer COVID-19 cases in May. During Phase III, COVID-19 incidence only gradually declined, remaining as high as the incidence seen at the end of Phase I. Across communities, the prevalence of households at high risk for intergenerational transmission was strongly correlated with the persistence of continued COVID-19 propagation. This association was even stronger in those communities with a higher rate of gym attendance in Phase II. The map of the prevalence of at-risk households in Los Angeles County coincided strikingly with the map of cumulative COVID-19 incidence. These findings, taken together, support the critical role of household structure in the persistent propagation of COVID-19 infections in Los Angeles County.

396,Prioritisation of population groups with the most interactions for COVID-19 vaccination can substantially reduce total fatalities,"The rapid development of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an unprecedented achievement. Once vaccines become mass produced, they will have to be distributed to almost the entire population to prevent deaths and permit prompt economic recovery. The necessity to vaccinate a large number of people in a short period of time, and possibly with insufficient vaccine doses to cover most, creates in itself a new challenge for governments and health authorities: which population groups (by age or other criteria) should be targeted first and what sequence must be followed, if any at all, to achieve the minimum number of fatalities? In this work, we demonstrate the importance and impact of optimally planning the priorities for vaccine deployment by population groups using a modified SEIR-type model for the COVID-19 outbreak considering age-related groups. Finding the absolute guaranteed best solution of the mathematical optimisation problem may be hard, if even possible, and would likely require intense computational resources for every possible case study scenario. In this work, several strategies are evaluated and compared, in an attempt to approach the most effective possible vaccination priority sequence in an example case study using demographic and epidemiological data from Spain. The minimum total fatalities at the end of the vaccination campaign is the objective pursued. The population groups classifications are established based on relevant differences in mortality (due to their age) and risk-related behaviour such as their number of daily person-to-person interactions. Assuming a capacity limited constant vaccination rate, vaccination distribution strategies were evaluated for different vaccine effectiveness levels and different percentages of final vaccine population coverage. Our results unambiguously show how planning vaccination by priority groups can achieve dramatic reductions in total fatalities (more than 70% in some cases) compared to no prioritisation. The results also indicate in all cases, for all vaccine effectiveness and coverage values evaluated, that the criteria for groups vaccination priority should not be those with the highest mortality but rather those the highest number of daily person-to-person interactions. Strikingly, our results show in all cases, that prioritisation of groups with the highest mortality but less social interactions, may lead to significantly larger numbers of final total fatalities, even higher as if no group priorities were established at all. The explanation, clearly displayed by the mechanistic model, is that vaccination avoids infections that reduce mortality not only from the vaccinated group itself but also from the projected secondary and subsequent infections inflicted on the rest of the population by those vaccinated in that group. Precisely this amplification effect (exponential nature of the curve) appears to cause the larger reduction in total fatalities if the groups with the most interactions are vaccinated first. The possible contradiction of these results with some published recommendations highlight the importance of conducting an open comprehensive and rigorous analysis of this problem leaving behind any subjective preconceptions.",Jorge Rodriguez; Mauricio Paton; Juan M Acuna,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211094,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211094,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
397,COVID-19 in Italy: targeted testing as a proxy of limited health care facilities and a key to reducing hospitalization rate and the death toll.,"The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV) has induced a worldwide pandemic, notably in Italy, one of the worst-hit countries in Europe, which witnessed a death toll unseen in the recent past. There are potentially many factors, such as infections from undetected index cases, early vs late testing strategies, limited health care facilities etc., that might have aggravated the COVID-19 situation in Italy. We developed a COVID-19 specific infection epidemic model composed of susceptible (S), exposed (E), carrier (C), infected (I), recovery (R) and dead (D) (SECIRD), specifically parameterized for Italy to disentangle the impact of these factors and their implications on infection dynamics to help planning an effective control strategy for a possible second wave. Our model discriminates between detected infected and undetected individuals who played a crucial role in the disease spreading and is not well addressed by classical SEIR-like transmission models. We first estimated the number of undetected infections through a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, which ranges from [~] 7 to [~] 22 fold higher than reported infections, depending upon regions. We exploited this information to evaluate the impact of the undetected component on the evolution of the pandemic and the benefits of an enhanced testing strategy. In high testing regions like Veneto, 18% of all infections resulted in hospitalization, while for Lombardia and Piemonte, it is 25% and 27%, respectively. We investigated the impact of an overwhelmed health care system upon death toll by applying hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) capacities in the SECIRD model, and we estimated a 10% reduction in death in Lombardia, the worst hit region, if a higher number of hospital facilities had been available since the beginning. Adopting a combined strategy of rapid early and targeted testing ([~] 10 fold) with increased hospital capacity would help in avoiding bottlenecks affecting the health care system. Our results demonstrate that the early testing would have a strong impact on the overall hospital accessibility and, hence, upon death toll ([~]20% to 50% reduction) and could have mitigated the lack of facilities at the crucial middle stage of the epidemic.",Arnab Bandyopadhyay; Marta Schips; Tanmay Mitra; Sahamoddin Khailaie; Sebastian Binder; Michael Meyer-Hermann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211169,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211169,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
398,SARS-CoV-2 sequencing reveals rapid transmission from college student clusters resulting in morbidity and deaths in vulnerable populations,"College reopening decisions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represent a trade-off between competing risks to students, faculty and staff, and college finances. Additionally, risks taken in reopening colleges can impose significant burdens on individuals living in surrounding communities. Many colleges that reopened for in-person instruction have reported frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. La Crosse County, Wisconsin experienced a substantial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (2,002 cases in September 2020) that coincided with the return to in-person instruction at three local academic institutions. Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 cases in La Crosse during that period found rapid expansion of two viral substrains. Although the majority of cases were among college-age individuals, from a total of 111 genomes sequenced we identified rapid transmission of the virus into more vulnerable populations. Eight sampled genomes represented two independent transmission events into two skilled nursing facilities, resulting in two fatalities. Our study highlights the very significant risks imposed by college administrator reopening decisions, not just on college-associated populations, but on vulnerable individuals in surrounding communities.",Craig S Richmond; Arick P Sabin; Dean A Jobe; Steven D Lovrich; Paraic A Kenny,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20210294,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20210294,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
399,Early Crowdfunding Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundAs the number of COVID-19 cases increased precipitously in the US, policymakers and health officials marshalled their pandemic responses. As the economic impacts multiplied, anecdotal reports noted the increased use of online crowdfunding to defray these costs. We examined the online crowdfunding response in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.

MethodsOn May 16, 2020, we extracted all available data available on US campaigns created between January 1 and May 10, 2020 on GoFundMe and identified the subset of COVID-related campaigns using keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored incidence of COVID-related campaigns by geography, by category, and over time and compared campaign characteristics to non-COVID-related campaigns after March 11 when the pandemic was declared.

ResultsWe found that there was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe online crowdfunding campaigns in March, largely attributable to COVID-related campaigns. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted and progressed, the number of campaigns per COVID-19 cases declined more than tenfold across all states. COVID-related campaigns raised more money, had a longer narrative description, and were more likely to be shared on Facebook than other campaigns in the study period.

ConclusionsOnline crowdfunding appears to be a transient stopgap, predicated on the novelty of an emergency rather than the true sustained need of a community. Rather, crowdfunding activity is likely an early marker for communities in acute distress that could be used by governments and aid organizations to guide disaster relief and policy.

401,Using Automated-Machine Learning to Predict COVID-19 Patient Survival: Identify Influential Biomarkers,"BackgroundIn a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. In this study, we used automated machine learning (autoML) to develop and compare between multiple machine learning (ML) models that predict the chance of patient survival from COVID-19 infection and identified the best-performing model. In addition, we investigated which biomarkers are the most influential in generating an accurate model. We believe an ML model such as this could be a useful tool for clinicians stratifying hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients.

MethodsThe data was retrospectively collected from Clinical Looking Glass (CLG) on all patients testing positive for COVID-19 through a nasopharyngeal specimen by real-time RT-PCR and admitted between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020 (4376 patients) at our institution. We collected 47 biomarkers from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity, and tracked whether a patient survived or not for one month following this time. We utilized the autoML from H2O.ai, an open source package for R language. The autoML generated 20 ML models and ranked them by area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) on the test set. We selected the best model (model_var_47) and chose a threshold probability that maximized F2 score to make a binary classifier: dead or alive. Subsequently, we ranked the relative importance of variables that generated model_var_47 and chose the 10 most influential variables. Next, we reran the autoML with these 10 variables and likewise selected the model with the best AUCPR on the test set (model_var_10). Again, threshold probability that maximized F2 score for model_var_10 was chosen to make a binary classifier. We calculated and compared the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicate value (PPV) for model_var_10 and model_var_47.

ResultsThe best model that autoML generated using all 47 variables was the stacked ensemble model of all models (AUCPR = 0.836). The most influential variables were: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, troponin, and glucose. When the autoML was retrained with these 10 most important variables, it did not significantly affect the performance (AUCPR= 0.828). For the binary classifiers, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of model_var_47 was 83.6%, 87.7%, and 69.8% respectively, while for model_var_10 they were 90.9%, 71.1%, and 51.8% respectively.

ConclusionsBy using autoML, we developed high-performing models that predict patient mortality from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we identified the most important biomarkers correlated with mortality. This ML model can be used as a decision supporting tool for medical practitioners to efficiently triage COVID-19 infected patients. From our literature review, this will be the largest COVID-19 patient cohort to train ML models and the first to utilize autoML.

403,"How Policies on Restaurants, Bars, Nightclubs, Masks, Schools, and Travel Influenced Swiss COVID-19 Reproduction Ratios","The role of complete lockdowns in reducing the reproduction ratios (Rt) of COVID-19 is now established. However, the persisting reality in many countries is no longer a complete lockdown, but restrictions of varying degrees using different choices of Non-pharmaceutical interaction (NPI) policies. A scientific basis for understanding the effectiveness of these graded NPI policies in reducing the Rt is urgently needed to address the concerns on personal liberties and economic activities. In this work, we develop a systematic relation between the degrees of NPIs implemented by the 26 cantons in Switzerland during March 9 - September 13 and their respective contributions to the Rt. Using a machine learning framework, we find that Rt which should ideally be lower than 1.0, has significant contributions in the post-lockdown scenario from the different activities - restaurants (0.0523 (CI. 0.0517-0.0528)), bars (0.030 (CI. 0.029-0.030)), and nightclubs (0.154 (CI. 0.154-0.156)). Activities which keep the land-borders open (0.177 (CI. 0.175-0.178)), and tourism related activities contributed comparably 0.177 (CI. 0.175-0.178). However, international flights with a quarantine did not add further to the Rt of the cantons. The requirement of masks in public transport and secondary schools contributed to an overall 0.025 (CI. 0.018-0.030) reduction in Rt, compared to the baseline usage even when there are no mandates.

We conducted a real-world retrospective cohort study in 688 primary-to-tertiary medical units in Mexico City; 395,343 patients were evaluated for suspected COVID-19 between February 24 and September 14, 2020. All patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (n=137,012) were included; those receiving unspecified antivirals (n=137), excluded, and groups of antivirals with <30 patients (n=20), eliminated. Survival and mortality risk analyses were done for patients receiving antivirals, antibiotics, both, or none (exposition groups). 136,855 patients were analyzed; mean age 44.2 (SD:16.8) years; 51.3% were men. 16.6% received an antiviral (3%), antibiotic (10%), or both (3.6%). More symptomatic patients received antivirals and antibiotics more often. Antivirals studied were Oseltamivir (n=8414), Amantadine (n=319), Lopinavir-Ritonavir (n=100), Rimantadine (n=61), Zanamivir (n=39), and Acyclovir (n=36). Survival with antivirals (73.7%, P<.001) and antibiotics (85.8%, P<.001) was lower than no antiviral/antibiotic (93.6%) in the general population. Increased risk of death was observed with antivirals in ambulatory (HR=4.7, 95%CI:3.94-5.62) and non-critical (HR=2.03, 95%CI:1.86-2.21) patients; no benefit in hospitalized and critical patients. Oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality in the general population (HR=1.72, 95%CI:1.61-1.84), ambulatory (HR=4.79, 95%CI:4.01-5.75), non-critical (HR=2.05, 95%CI:1.88-2.23), and pregnancy (HR=8.35, 95%CI:1.77-39.30). Antibiotics were a protective factor in hospitalized (HR=0.81, 95%CI:0.77-0.86) and critical patients (HR=0.67, 95%CI:0.63-0.72), but a risk factor in the general population (HR=1.13, 95%CI:1.08-1.19) and children and adolescents (HR=4.22, 95%CI:2.01-8.86). In conclusion, oseltamivir was associated with increased mortality or no benefit in all groups. Common antivirals for COVID-19 should be avoided.

406,Funding and COVID-19 Research Priorities - Are the research needs for Africa being met?,"IntroductionEmerging data from Africa indicates remarkably low numbers of reported COVID-19 deaths despite high levels of disease transmission. However evolution of these trends as the pandemic progresses remains unknown. More certain are the devastating long-term impacts of the pandemic on health and development evident globally. Research tailored to the unique needs of African countries is crucial.

UKCDR and GloPID-R have launched a tracker of funded COVID-19 projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and research priorities of Africa and less-resourced countries and published a baseline analysis of a Living Systematic Review (LSR) of these projects.

MethodsIn-depth analyses of the baseline LSR for COVID-19 funded research projects in Africa (as of 15th July 2020) to determine the funding landscape and alignment of the projects to research priorities of relevance to Africa.

ResultsThe limited COVID-19 related research across Africa appears to be supported mainly by international funding, especially from Europe, although with notably limited funding from United States-based funders. At the time of this analysis no research projects funded by an African-based funder were identified in the tracker although there are several active funding calls geared at research in Africa and there may be funding data which has not been made publicly available.

Many projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and 5 particular gaps in research funding were identified namely: investigating the role of children in COVID-19 transmission; effective modes of community engagement; health systems research; communication of uncertainties surrounding mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19; and identifying ways to promote international cooperation. Capacity strengthening was identified as a dominant theme in funded research project plans.

ConclusionsWe found significantly lower funding investments in COVID-19 research in Africa compared to High-Income Countries, seven months into the pandemic, indicating a paucity of research targeting the research priorities of relevance to Africa.

407,Implementing a Telemedicine Curriculum for Internal Medicine Residents during a Pandemic: The Cleveland Clinic Experience,"IntroductionTelemedicine is an important element of healthcare. However, until the COVID-19 pandemic, training in telemedicine was not a substantial element of most residency programs. Social distancing measures changed this. The Cleveland Clinic Internal Medicine Residency Program (IMRP) is one of the largest programs in the United States, which made the task of developing and adopting an effective, expedited telemedicine curriculum challenging. Our goal was to implement a system for teaching telemedicine care skills and supervising the care provided by residents during virtual visits.

MethodsThis study was started in April 2020. We developed and implemented a resident-led curriculum and training program for providing telemedicine care in less than five weeks. This entailed creating a formal training program for residents, creating a resource guide for the different video communication tools, and training preceptors to safely supervise care in this new paradigm. We also created an assessment instrument in our education evaluation system that allows residents to receive feedback on their performance during virtual appointments.

ResultsOver 2000 virtual visits were performed by residents in a span of 10 weeks. Of 148 residents, 38% responded to the pre-participation survey. A majority had no prior telemedicine experience and expressed only slight comfort with the modality.

ObjectiveWe sought to develop and validate a standard definition of COVID-19 severity from readily accessible EHR data across the Consortium.

MethodsWe developed an EHR-based severity algorithm and validated it on patient hospitalization data from 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes of ICU admission and/or death. We also used a machine learning approach to compare selected predictors of severity to the 4CE algorithm at one site.

ResultsThe 4CE severity algorithm performed with pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The sensitivity of single code categories for acuity were unacceptably inaccurate - varying by up to 0.65 across sites. A multivariate machine learning approach identified codes resulting in mean AUC 0.956 (95% CI: 0.952, 0.959) compared to 0.903 (95% CI: 0.886, 0.921) using expert-derived codes. Billing codes were poor proxies of ICU admission, with 49% precision and recall compared against chart review at one partner institution.

DiscussionWe developed a proxy measure of severity that proved resilient to coding variability internationally by using a set of 6 code classes. In contrast, machine-learning approaches may tend to overfit hospital-specific orders. Manual chart review revealed discrepancies even in the gold standard outcomes, possibly due to pandemic conditions.

The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), where in parts of the US, accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19.

Methods and findingsHere, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees in order to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group are investigated as well as the potential economic gain resulting from savings in COVID-19 related treatment costs in comparison to costs resulting from the testing interventions. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in the Federal Republic of Germany.

The probability is nearly one that COVID-19 spreads into closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Regular screening of all employees by PCR tests provides a significant reduction of COVID-19 cases and related deaths in LTCFs. While the frequency of testing (testing rate) and the quality of tests have noticeable effects, the waiting time for obtaining test results (ranging from 12 up to 96 hours) hardly impacts the outcome. The results suggest that testing every two weeks with low-quality tests and a processing time of up to 96 hours yields a strong reduction in the number of cases. Rough estimates suggest a significant economic gain.

ConclusionsThe introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. These measures provide an economically meaningful way to protect vulnerable risk groups characterized by an elevated risk of severe infections in closed facilities, in which contact-reducing measures are difficult to implement due to imminent unavoidable close human-to-human contacts.",Henri Christian Junior Tsoungui Obama; Nessma Adil Mahmoud Yousif; Looli Hassan Mohamed Alawam Nemer; Pierre Marie Ngougoue Ngougoue; Gideon Akumah Ngwa; Miranda Teboh-Ewungkem; Kristan Schneider,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211573,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211573,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

412,"Clinical characteristics, symptoms, management and health outcomes in 8,598 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to 27,510 with seasonal influenza in France, Spain and the US: a network cohort analysis","OBJECTIVESTo describe comorbidities, symptoms at presentation, medication use, and 30-day outcomes after a diagnosis of COVID-19 in pregnant women, in comparison to pregnant women with influenza.

DESIGNMultinational network cohort

SETTINGA total of 6 databases consisting of electronic medical records and claims data from France, Spain, and the United States.

PARTICIPANTSPregnant women with [&ge;] 1 year in contributing databases, diagnosed and/or tested positive, or hospitalized with COVID-19. The influenza cohort was derived from the 2017-2018 influenza season.

OUTCOMESBaseline patient characteristics, comorbidities and presenting symptoms; 30-day inpatient drug utilization, maternal complications and pregnancy-related outcomes following diagnosis/hospitalization.

RESULTS8,598 women diagnosed (2,031 hospitalized) with COVID-19 were included. Hospitalized women had, compared to those diagnosed, a higher prevalence sof pre-existing comorbidities including renal impairment (2.2% diagnosed vs 5.1% hospitalized) and anemia (15.5% diagnosed vs 21.3% hospitalized).

The ten most common inpatient treatments were systemic corticosteroids (29.6%), enoxaparin (24.0%), immunoglobulins (21.4%), famotidine (20.9%), azithromycin (18.1%), heparin (15.8%), ceftriaxone (7.9%), aspirin (7.0%), hydroxychloroquine (5.4%) and amoxicillin (3.5%).

Compared to 27,510 women with influenza, dyspnea and anosmia were more prevalent in those with COVID-19. Women with COVID-19 had higher frequency of cesarean-section (4.4% vs 3.1%), preterm delivery (0.9% vs 0.5%), and poorer maternal outcomes: pneumonia (12.0% vs 2.7%), ARDS (4.0% vs 0.3%) and sepsis (2.1% vs 0.7%). COVID-19 fatality was negligible (N<5 in each database respectively).

CONCLUSIONSComorbidities that were more prevalent with COVID-19 hospitalization (compared to COVID-19 diagnosed) in pregnancy included renal impairment and anemia. Multiple medications were used to treat pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, some with little evidence of benefit. Anosmia and dyspnea were indicative symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnancy compared to influenza, and may aid differential diagnosis. Despite low fatality, pregnancy and maternal outcomes were worse in COVID-19 than influenza.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LICompared to non-pregnant women of reproductive age, pregnant women are less likely to experience typical COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever and myalgia.
C_LIO_LIObesity, high maternal age, and comorbid hypertension and diabetes are risk factors for severe COVID-19 among pregnant women.
C_LIO_LIDespite relatively high rates of pneumonia and need for oxygen supplementation, fatality rates in pregnant women with COVID-19 are generally low (<1%).
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIAlthough not often recorded, dyspnea and anosmia were more often seen in pregnant women with COVID-19 than in women with seasonal influenza, in 6 databases from 3 countries (US, France, Spain).
C_LIO_LIRenal impairment and anemia were more common among hospitalized than diagnosed women with COVID-19 during pregnancy.
C_LIO_LIDespite limited data on benefit-risk in pregnancy, a large number of medications were used for inpatient management of COVID-19 in pregnant women: approximately 1 in 3 received corticosteroids (some may have been given for a pregnancy-related indication rather than for COVID-19 treatment), 1 in 4 enoxaparin, and 1 in 5 immunoglobulin, famotidine and azithromycin.
C_LIO_LICompared to influenza, there was a higher frequency of pregnancy-related complications (cesarean section and preterm deliveries), as well as poorer maternal outcomes (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular and thromboembolic events) seen in pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.

413,Persistent symptoms after Covid-19: qualitative study of 114 long Covid patients and draft quality criteria for services,"BackgroundApproximately 10% of patients with Covid-19 experience symptoms beyond 3-4 weeks. Patients call this ""long Covid"". We sought to document the lived experience of such patients, their accounts of accessing and receiving healthcare, and their ideas for improving services.

MethodWe held 55 individual interviews and 8 focus groups (n = 59) with people recruited from UK-based long Covid patient support groups, social media and snowballing. We restricted some focus groups to health professionals since they had already self-organised into online communities. Participants were invited to tell their personal stories and comment on others stories. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded using NVIVO. Analysis incorporated sociological theories of illness, healing, peer support, the clinical relationship, access to care, and service redesign.

ResultsThe sample was 70% female, aged 27-73 years, and comprised White British (74%), Asian (11%), White Other (7%), Black (4%), and Mixed (4%). 27 were doctors and 23 other health professionals. 10% had been hospitalised. Analysis revealed a confusing illness with many, varied and often relapsing-remitting symptoms and uncertain prognosis; a heavy sense of loss and stigma; difficulty accessing and navigating services; difficulty being taken seriously and achieving a diagnosis; disjointed and siloed care (including inability to access specialist services); variation in standards (e.g. inconsistent criteria for seeing, investigating and referring patients); variable quality of the therapeutic relationship (some participants felt well supported while others felt ""fobbed off""); and possible critical events (e.g. deterioration after being unable to access services). Emotional touch points in participants experiences informed ideas for improving services.

ConclusionQuality principles for a long Covid service should include ensuring access to care, reducing burden of illness, taking clinical responsibility and providing continuity of care, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation, evidence-based investigation and management, and further development of the knowledge base and clinical services.

414,Systematic analysis of electronic health records identifies drugs reducing risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and severity,"BACKGROUNDIt may take months to years until drugs specifically designed to treat COVID-19 are available. Until then, it is crucial to identify whether existing medications could have a protective effect against severe disease. This is the objective of this large population study performed in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel.

METHODSCHS centrally manages electronic health records (EHRs) including medication purchases for over 4.5 million members. Two case-control matched cohorts were assembled to assess systematically which drugs affected the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization: in both cohorts, case patients were hospitalized for COVID-19; matched control patients were taken from the general population in the first cohort, and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the second cohort. For each medication anatomical-therapeutic-chemical (ATC) class acquired during the last month before the index-date, we computed the odds ratio (OR) for hospitalization, 95% confidence interval (CI), and the p-value, using Fishers exact test. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing.

RESULTSSeveral drugs and pharmacy sold items were associated with significantly reduced odds for SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, notably ubiquinone (OR=0.185, 95% CI [0.058,0.458], p<0.001), ezetimibe (OR=0.513, 95% CI [0.375,0.688], P<0.001), rosuvastatin (OR=0.746, 95% CI [0.645,0.858], p<0.001) and flecainide (OR=0.303, 95% CI [0.080,0.813], p<0.01). Additionally, acquisition of surgical masks, latex gloves and several ophthalmological products were associated with decreased risk for hospitalization.

CONCLUSIONUbiquinone, ezetimibe and rosuvastatin, all related to the cholesterol synthesis pathway were associated with reduced hospitalization risk.

415,"Less severe course of COVID-19 is associated with elevated levels of antibodies against seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 (HCoV OC43, HCoV HKU1)","The clinical course of COVID-19 is very heterogeneous: Most infected individuals can be managed in an outpatient setting, but a substantial proportion of patients requires intensive care, resulting in a high rate of fatalities. Recently, an association between contact to small children and mild course of COVID-19 was reported. We performed an observational study to assess the impact of previous infections with seasonal coronaviruses on COVID-19 severity. 60 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were included (age 30 - 82 years; 52 males, 8 females): 19 inpatients with critical disease, 16 inpatients with severe or moderate disease and 25 outpatients (age and gender matched to inpatients). Patients with critical disease had significantly lower levels of HCoV OC43- (p=0.016) and HCoV HKU1-specific (p=0.023) antibodies at the first encounter compared to other COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that previous infections with seasonal coronaviruses might protect against a severe course of disease.

416,Prone positioning of non-intubated patients with COVID-19 - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"PurposeSeveral studies have reported adopting prone positioning (PP) in non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related hypoxaemic respiratory failure. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of PP on oxygenation and clinical outcomes.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase and COVID-19 living systematic review from December1st 2019 to July23rd 2020. We included studies that reported using PP in hypoxaemic, non-intubated adult COVID-19 patients. Primary outcome measure was the weighted mean difference (MD) in oxygenation parameters (PaO2/FiO2, PaO2 or SpO2) pre and post-PP.

ResultsFifteen single arm observational studies reporting PP in 449 patients were included. Substantial heterogeneity was noted in terms of, location within hospital where PP was instituted, respiratory supports, frequency and duration of PP. Significant improvement in oxygenation was reported post-PP: PaO2/FiO2, (MD 37.6, 95%CI 18.8, 56.5); PaO2, (MD 30.4 mmHg, 95%CI 10.9, 49.9); and SpO2, (MD 5.8%, 95%CI 3.7, 7.9). Patients with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 [&le;]150 experienced greater oxygenation improvements compared with those with a pre-PP PaO2/FiO2 >150 (MD 40.5, 95%CI -3.5, 84.6) vs. 37, 95%CI 17.1, 56.9). Respiratory rate decreased post-PP (MD -2.9, 95%CI -5.4, -0.4). Overall intubation and mortality rates were 21% (90/426) and 26% (101/390) respectively. No major adverse events were reported.

ConclusionsDespite significant variability in frequency and duration of PP and respiratory supports, PP was associated with improvements in oxygenation parameters without any reported serious adverse events. Major limitation being lack of control arm and adjustment for confounders. Clinical trials are required to determine the effect of awake PP on patient-centred outcomes.

417,Healthcare workers with mild / asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection show T cell responses and neutralising antibodies after the first wave,"Studies of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 include characterisation of lethal, severe and mild cases1-8. Understanding how long immunity lasts in people who have had mild or asymptomatic infection is crucial. Healthcare worker (HCW) cohorts exposed to and infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic are an invaluable resource to study this question9-14. The UK COVIDsortium is a longitudinal, London hospital HCW cohort, followed from the time of UK lockdown9,10 ; weekly PCR, serology and symptom diaries allowed capture of asymptomatic infection around the time of onset, so duration of immunity could be tracked. Here, we conduct a cross-sectional, case-control, sub-study of 136 HCW at 16-18 weeks after UK lockdown, with 76 having had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 mild or asymptomatic infection. Neutralising antibodies (nAb) were present in 90% of infected HCW sampled after the first wave; titres, likely to correlate with functional protection, were present in 66% at 16-18 weeks. T cell responses tended to be lower in asymptomatic infected HCW than those reporting case-definition symptoms of COVID-19, while nAb titres were maintained irrespective of symptoms. T cell and antibody responses were discordant. HCW lacking nAb also showed undetectable T cells to Spike protein but had T cells of other specificities. Our findings suggest that the majority of HCW with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection carry nAb complemented by multi-specific T cell responses for at least 4 months after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Catherine J.

We hypothesise there are local clusters of coronavirus which would therefore be amenable to targeted public health measures.

MethodsThis is a retrospective, observational case series conducted in a West London District General Hospital. All patients admitted to hospital with a radiological or microbiological diagnosis of Covid-19 were included (children under 16 years were excluded). Consecutive sampling was used and baseline characteristics including age, sex, postcode and final patient outcome were collected from the electronic health records. Patient origin postcode was plotted to a map of the local area and an online cloud based mapping analysis system was used to generate heat maps and case density maps which were compared to living base layers. The primary outcome was identification of local clusters of cases of coronavirus. Secondary outcome was identification of population characteristics that may provide evidence for more targetted public health intervention in a second wave.

ResultsLocal clusters of infection were identified within the target population. These appeared to correlate with higher indices of deprivation, poorer overall health and high household occupancy suggesting a role for public health measures to target these areas.

419,Mathematical Perspective of Covid-19 Pandemic: Disease Extinction Criteria in Deterministic and Stochastic Models,"The world has been facing the biggest virological invasion in the form of Covid-19 pandemic since the beginning of the year 2020. In this paper, we consider a deterministic epidemic model of four compartments classified based on the health status of the populations of a given country to capture the disease progression. A stochastic extension of the deterministic model is further considered to capture the uncertainty or variation observed in the disease transmissibility. In the case of a deterministic system, the disease-free equilibrium will be globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, otherwise, the disease persists. Using Lyapunov functional methods, we prove that the infected population of the stochastic system tends to zero exponentially almost surely if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The stochastic system has no interior equilibrium, however, its asymptotic solution is shown to fluctuate around the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic system under some parametric restrictions, implying that the infection persists. A case study with the Covid-19 epidemic data of Spain is presented and various analytical results have been demonstrated. The epidemic curve in Spain clearly shows two waves of infection. The first wave was observed during March-April and the second wave started in the middle of July and not completed yet. A real-time basic reproduction number has been given to illustrate the epidemiological status of Spain throughout the study period. Estimated cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases are 1,613,626 and 42,899, respectively, with case fatality rate 2.66 per cent till the deadly virus is eliminated from Spain.",Debadatta Adak; Abhijit Majumder; Nandadulal Bairagi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211201,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211201,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
420,A comparative study of infection and mortality in COVID-19 across countries: A scaling analysis,"Analysing infection and mortality data for COVID-19 as a function of days for 54 countries across all continents, we show that there is a simple scaling behaviour connecting these two quantities for any given nation when the data is segmented over few ranges of dates covering the most rapid spread of the pandemic and the recovery, wherever achieved. This scaling is described by two parameters, one representing a shift along the time axis and the other is a normalisation factor, providing a reliable definition of the mortality rate for each country in a given period. The number of segments for any country required in our analyses turns out to be surprisingly few with as many as 16 out of 54 countries being described by a single segment and no country requiring more than three segments. Estimates of the shift and mortality for these 54 countries in different periods show large spreads ranging over 0-16 days and 0.45-19.96%, respectively. Shift and mortality are found to be inversely correlated. Analyses of number of tests carried out for detecting COVID-19 and the number of infections detected due to such tests suggest that an effective way to increase the shift, and therefore, decrease mortality, is to increase number of tests per infection detected. This points to the need of a dynamic management of testing that should accelerate with the rise of the pandemic; it also suggests a basis for adjusting variations in the testing patterns in different geographical locations within a given country.",Ranjan Das; Akmal Hossain; Sayak Mandal; Debasmita Pariari; Rohit Kumar Rohj; Swapnil Shukla; Rahul Mahavir Varma; Dipankar Das Sarma,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212175,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212175,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
421,School closures and SARS-CoV-2. Evidence from Sweden's partial school closure,"To reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 most countries closed schools, despite uncertainty if school closures are an effective containment measure. At the onset of the pandemic, Swedish upper secondary schools moved to online instruction while lower secondary school remained open. This allows for a comparison of parents and teachers differently exposed to open and closed schools, but otherwise facing similar conditions. Leveraging rich Swedish register data, we connect all students and teachers in Sweden to their families and study the impact of moving to online instruction on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We find that among parents, exposure to open rather than closed schools resulted in a small increase in PCR-confirmed infections [OR 1.15; CI95 1.03-1.27]. Among lower secondary teachers the infection rate doubled relative to upper secondary teachers [OR 2.01; CI95 1.52-2.67]. This spilled over to the partners of lower secondary teachers who had a higher infection rate than their upper secondary counterparts [OR 1.30; CI95 1.00-1.68]. When analyzing COVID-19 diagnoses from healthcare visits and the incidence of severe health outcomes, results are similar for teachers but somewhat weaker for parents and teachers partners. The results for parents indicate that keeping lower secondary schools open had minor consequences for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in society.

422,A delayed modulation of solar radiation on the COVID-19 transmission reflects an incubation period,"Laboratory experiments have revealed the meteorological sensitivity of the virus of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no consensus has been reached about how the meteorological conditions modulate the virus transmission as it is constrained more often by non-meteorological factors. Here, we find that the non-meteorological factors constrain statistically-least the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases in a country when the cases arrive around 2500-3000. The least-constrained growth rate correlates with the near-surface ultraviolet flux and temperature significantly (correlation coefficients r=-0.55{+/-}0.08 and -0.45{+/-}0.08 at p < 10-5, respectively). In response to increases of 1W/m2 ultraviolet and 1{degrees}C temperature, the growth rate decreases by 0.33{+/-}0.11% and 0.18{+/-}0.08% per day, respectively. The response to the ultraviolet flux exhibits a delay by about 7 days, providing an independent measure of the incubation period.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. We performed risk of bias evaluation of all included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Results2,178 articles were retrieved and 11 studies were included. Five cohort studies reported a combined 22 student and 21 staff index cases that exposed 3,345 contacts with 18 transmissions [overall infection attack rate (IAR): 0.08% (95% CI: 0.00%-0.86%)].

Gender differences were not found for secondary infection (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.50-4.14, P= 0.49) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.72-1.13, P= 0.36) in schools. Fever, cough, dyspnea, ageusia, anosmia, rhinitis, sore throat, headache, myalgia, asthenia, and diarrhoea were all associated with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (based on two studies). Overall, study quality was judged to be poor with risk of performance and attrition bias, limiting the confidence in the results.

ConclusionsThere is limited high-quality evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community transmission. Emerging evidence suggests lower IAR and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in students compared to school staff. Future prospective and adequately controlled cohort studies are necessary to confirm this finding.",Wei Xu; Xue Li; Marshall Dozier; Yazhou He; Amir Kirolos; Zhongyu Lang; Catherine Mathews; Nandi Siegfried; Evropi Theodoratou,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210658,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210658,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

425,"Precautionary breaks: planned, limited duration circuit breaks to control the prevalence of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic in the UK has been characterised by periods of exponential growth and decline, as different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are brought into play. During the early uncontrolled phase of the outbreak (early March 2020) there was a period of prolonged exponential growth with epidemiological observations such as hospitalisation doubling every 3-4 days (growth rate r {approx} 0.2). The enforcement of strict lockdown measures led to a noticeable decline in all epidemic quantities (r {approx} -0.06) that slowed during the summer as control measures were relaxed (r {approx} -0.02). Since August, infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been rising (precise estimation of the current growth rate is difficult due to extreme regional heterogeneity and temporal lags between the different epidemiological observations) and various NPIs have been applied locally throughout the UK in response.

Controlling any rise in infection is a compromise between public health and societal costs, with more stringent NPIs reducing cases but damaging the economy and restricting freedoms. Currently, NPI imposition is made in response to the epidemiological state, are of indefinite length and are often imposed at short notice, greatly increasing the negative impact. An alternative approach is to consider planned, limited duration periods of strict NPIs aiming to purposefully reduce prevalence before such emergency NPIs are required. These ""precautionary breaks"" may offer a means of keeping control of the epidemic, while their fixed duration and the forewarning may limit their society impact. Here, using simple analysis and age-structured models matched to the unfolding UK epidemic, we investigate the action of precautionary breaks. In particular we consider their impact on the prevalence of infection, as well as the total number of predicted hospitalisations and deaths. We find that precautionary breaks provide the biggest gains when the growth rate is low, but offer a much needed brake on increasing infection when the growth rate is higher, potentially allowing other measures (such as contact tracing) to regain control.",Matt J Keeling; Glen Guyver-Fletcher; Alexander Holmes; Louise J Dyson; Michael Tildesley; Edward M Hill; Graham F Medley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211813,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20211813,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
426,Nonspecific blood tests as proxies for COVID-19 hospitalization: are there plausible associations after excluding noisy predictors?,"This study applied causal criteria in directed acyclic graphs for handling covariates in associations for prognosis of severe COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 19) cases. To identify nonspecific blood tests and risk factors as predictors of hospitalization due to COVID-19, one has to exclude noisy predictors by comparing the concordance statistics (AUC) for positive and negative cases of SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Predictors with significant AUC at negative stratum should be either controlled for their confounders or eliminated (when confounders are unavailable). Models were classified according to the difference of AUC between strata. The framework was applied to an open database with 5644 patients from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) exam. C-reactive Protein (CRP) was a noisy predictor: hospitalization could have happen due to causes other than COVID-19 even when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is positive and CRP is reactive, as most cases are asymptomatic to mild. Candidates of characteristic response from moderate to severe inflammation of COVID-19 were: combinations of eosinophils, monocytes and neutrophils, with age as risk factor; and creatinine, as risk factor, sharpens the odds ratio of the model with monocytes, neutrophils, and age.",Gerson Ishikawa; Graziela Argenti; Cristina Berger Fadel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211557,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211557,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
427,Does autism protect against COVID quarantine effects?,"IntroductionCOVID-19 outbreak has imposed an eight-week confinement in France. During this period, children and their families were exposed to a full-time home life. The aim of this study was to assess the emotional experience and tolerance of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in this particular context.

MethodA clinical survey was proposed to parents and rated by professionals once a week during the quarantine period in France. 95 autistic children followed by the child and adolescent psychiatry department of Tours university hospital were assessed from the 18th of March to the 8th of May. The following clinical points were investigated: child anxiety, family anxiety, behavior problems, impact on sleep, impact on appetite, impact on school work, family tension, confinement intolerance, difficulties to follow a schedule, isolation behavior.

ResultsDespite minor changes in family anxiety and school work, no difference was highlighted between clinical scores collected at the beginning and at the end of this period. ASD children with or without intellectual disability had non-significant clinical changes during quarantine. This evolution was also independent of the accommodation type (house or apartment) and the parental status (relationship, separated or isolated).

ConclusionThe sameness dimension in autism and parents adaptation may be involved in this clinical stability during COVID confinement. Moreover, specialized tools and support provided by professionals could have participated to these outcomes and must be regularly promoted in order to help families in this still difficult period.",Marco Guidotti; Adrien Gateau; Joelle Malvy; Frederique Bonnet-Brilhault,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212118,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212118,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
428,Circulating Proteins Influencing COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: a Mendelian Randomization Study,"Proteins detectable in peripheral blood may influence COVID-19 susceptibility or severity. However, understanding which circulating proteins are etiologically involved is difficult because their levels may be influenced by COVID-19 itself and also subject to confounding factors. To identify circulating proteins influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity we undertook a large-scale two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, since this study design can rapidly scan hundreds of circulating proteins and reduces bias due to confounding and reverse causation. We began by identifying the genetic determinants of 955 circulating proteins in up to 10,708 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals, retaining only single nucleotide polymorphisms near the gene encoded by the circulating protein. We then undertook an MR study to estimate the effect of these proteins on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the Host Genetics Initiative. We found that a standard deviation increase in OAS1 levels was associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (N = 2,972 cases / 284,472 controls; OR = 0.48, P = 7x10-8), COVID-19 hospitalization (N = 6,492 / 1,012,809; OR = 0.60, P = 2x10-7) and COVID-19 susceptibility (N = 17,607 / 1,345,334; OR = 0.81, P = 6x10-5). Results were consistent despite multiple sensitivity analyses probing MR assumptions. OAS1 is an interferon-stimulated gene that promotes viral RNA degradation. Other potentially implicated proteins included IL10RB. Available medicines, such as interferon-beta-1b, increase OAS1 and could be explored for their effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.",Sirui Zhou; Guillaume Butler-Laporte; Tomoko Nakanishi; David Morrison; Jonathan Afilalo; Marc Afilalo; Nofar Kimchi; Zaman Afrasiabi; Nardin Rezk; Meriem Bouab; Charlotte Guzman; Louis Petitjean; Xioaqing Xue; Christos Tselios; Branka Vulesevic; Yiheng Chen; Vincent Mooser; Vincenzo Forgetta; Daniel Kaufmann; Brent Richards,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212092,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.20212092,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True

In severe COVID-19 illness, there is significant up-regulation of complement and coagulation pathway, and negative correlation between NETosis and respiratory function (oxygen saturation). Interestingly, there is an early spike in the level of IL-6 gene expression in severe illness compared to moderate illness. With passing days post-onset, the level of IL-6 expression in severe illness approaches that in moderate illness. The data are consistent with IL-6 acting as a driver of NETosis in the early phase of severe COVID-19 illness, that results in a vicious cycle of NETosis-complement/coagulation-respiratory dysfunction.

Our assay achieves labeling, imaging and virus identification in less than five minutes and does not require any lysis, purification or amplification steps. The trained neural network was able to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from negative clinical samples, as well as from other common respiratory pathogens such as influenza and seasonal human coronaviruses, with high accuracy.

432,Innate lymphoid cell composition associates with COVID-19 disease severity,"ObjectivesThe role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is unknown. Understanding the immune response in COVID-19 could contribute to unravel the pathogenesis and identification of treatment targets. To describe the phenotypic landscape of circulating ILCs in COVID-19 patients and to identify ILC phenotypes correlated to serum biomarkers, clinical markers, and laboratory parameters relevant in COVID-19.

MethodsBlood samples collected from moderately (n=11) and severely ill (n=12) COVID-19 patients as well as healthy control donors (n=16), were analyzed with 18-parameter flow cytometry. Using supervised and unsupervised approaches, we examined the ILC activation status and homing profile. Clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained from all COVID-19 patients and serum biomarkers were analyzed with multiplex immunoassays.

ResultsILCs were largely depleted from the circulation of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Remaining circulating ILCs from patients revealed increased frequencies of ILC2 in moderate COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease of ILC precursors (ILCp), as compared with controls. ILC2 and ILCp showed an activated phenotype with increased CD69 expression, whereas expression levels of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 were significantly altered in ILC2 and ILCp, and ILC1, respectively. The activated ILC profile of COVID-19 patients was associated with soluble inflammatory markers, while frequencies of ILC subsets were correlated with laboratory parameters that reflect the disease severity.

433,Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on People with Hypertension,"ObjectivesIt is unclear how people with hypertension are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased risk, and whether targeted public health strategies are needed.

DesignThis retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during COVID-19 lockdown, to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety and prevention intentions.

MethodsBaseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown. Of 4362 baseline participants, 466 people reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions, and were randomly matched to healthy controls with similar age, gender, education and health literacy. A subset (n=1369) was followed-up at 2 months after restrictions eased, including 147 participants with hypertension only. Risk perceptions, prevention intentions and anxiety were measured.

ResultsAt baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension group had higher anxiety than controls; and were more willing to have the influenza vaccine. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal sub-sample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccine intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high (>80%).

ConclusionsAnxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was higher in the hypertension group, who also had higher vaccination intentions. Locations with prolonged restrictions may require targeted mental health screening for vulnerable groups. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high, which is encouraging for future prevention of COVID-19.",Carissa Bonner; Erin Cvejic; Julie Ayre; Jennifer Isautier; Christopher Semsarian; Brooke Nickel; Carys Batcup; Kristen Pickles; Rachael Dodd; Samuel Cornell; Tessa Copp; Kirsten J McCaffery,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211722,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211722,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,True
434,Frontline healthcare workers' experiences with personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a rapid qualitative appraisal,"ObjectivesTo report frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) experiences with personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. To understand HCWs fears and concerns surrounding PPE, their experiences following its guidance and how these affected their perceived ability to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA rapid qualitative appraisal study combining three sources of data: semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews with frontline HCWs (n=46), media reports (n=39 newspaper articles and 145,000 social media posts) and government PPE policies (n=25). HCWs interviewed were from secondary care, primary care and specialist community clinics. Media and policy data were from across the UK.

ResultsA major concern was running out of PPE, putting HCWs and patients at risk of infection. Following national-level guidance was often not feasible when there were shortages, leading to re-use and improvisation of PPE. Frequently changing guidelines generated confusion and distrust. PPE was reserved for high-risk secondary care settings and this translated into HCWs outside these settings feeling inadequately protected. Participants were concerned about inequitable access to PPE for community, lower seniority, female and ethnic minority HCWs. Participants continued delivering care despite the physical discomfort, practical problems and communication barriers associated with PPE use.

ConclusionThis study found that frontline HCWs persisted in caring for their patients despite multiple challenges including inappropriate provision of PPE, inadequate training and inconsistent guidance. In order to effectively care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline HCWs need appropriate provision of PPE, training in its use, as well as comprehensive and consistent guidance. These needs must be addressed in order to protect the health and well-being of the most valuable healthcare resource in the COVID-19 pandemic: our HCWs.

O_TEXTBOXWhat is already known?- PPE is an important component of infection prevention and control to protect HCWs delivering care on the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak.
- Frontline HCWs have reported challenges delivering care in PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Research understanding how HCWs responded to these challenges are lacking.


What are the new findings?- HCWs faced multiple challenges delivering care including inadequate provision of PPE, inconsistent guidance and lack of training in its use.
- HCWs persisted delivering care despite the negative physical effects, practical problems, lack of protected time for breaks and communication barriers associated with wearing PPE.
- In the face of training, guidance and procurement gaps, HCWs improvised by developing their own informal communication channels to share information, they trained each other and bought their own PPE.
- HCWs reported inequalities accessing PPE based on the healthcare sector, gender, level of seniority and ethnicity.


What do the new findings imply?- To feel safe and confident caring for patients, frontline HCWs need to be provided with appropriate size, quality and level of PPE, as well as training in its use.
- PPE guidance should be consistent, clearly communicated, and reflect the most up-to-date evidence-base for the safest level of PPE.
- Regular breaks for staff working in full PPE should be prioritised even in contexts of understaffing and PPE shortages as these are key aspects of well-being.

437,Post mortem pathological findings in COVID-19 cases: A Systematic Review,"BackgroundThe current COVID-19 pandemic is considered one of the most serious public health crisis over the last few decades. Although the disease can result in diverse, multiorgan pathology, there have been very few studies addressing the postmortem pathological findings of the cases. Active autopsy amid this pandemic could be an essential tool for diagnosis, surveillance, and research.

ObjectiveTo provide a total picture of the SARS-CoV-2 histopathological features of different body organs in postmortem autopsies through a systematic search of the published literature.

MethodsA systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google scholar, Medrxiv & Biorxiv) was carried out from December 2019 to August, 15th 2020, for journal articles of different study designs reporting postmortem pathological findings in COVID-19 cases. PRISMA guidelines were used for reporting the review.

ResultsA total of 50 articles reporting 430 cases were included in our analysis. Postmortem pathological findings were reported for different body organs, pulmonary system (42 articles), cardiovascular system (23 articles), hepatobiliary system (22 articles), kidney (16 articles), spleen, and lymph nodes (12 articles), and central nervous system (7 articles). In lung samples, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was the most commonly reported findings in 239 cases (84.4%). Myocardial hypertrophy (87 cases by 51.2%), arteriosclerosis (121 cases by 62%), and steatosis (118 cases by 59.3%) were the most commonly reported pathological findings in the heart, kidney, and hepatobiliary system respectively.

We assessed data as of September 1, 2020 from our combined laboratories and as reported for selected states and countries for case, death, and testing rates per 1 million in the population. Our goal was to elucidate potential causes for the large rate differences observed. SARS-CoV-2 naso-pharyngeal (NP) RNA swab testing in 985,219 US subjects referred to our laboratories by healthcare providers revealed an overall 10.1% positive rate, comparable to the 7.3% rate reported nationwide. In a small subset of 91 subjects, all of whom had been positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NP swabs 2-4 weeks earlier, NP swab testing was twice as likely to be positive (58.6%) as saliva samples (21.5%), based on paired sampling. Our positive rates per state agreed reasonably well with reported Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data (r=0.609, P<0.0001) based on 19,898 cases, 593 deaths, and 271,637 tests, all per 1 million in the US population. Louisiana had the highest case rate; New Jersey had the highest death rate; and Rhode Island had the highest testing rate. Of 47 countries, including all countries with populations >50 million, Qatar had the highest case rate; Peru had the highest death rate; and Israel had the highest testing rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Correlations between case rates and death rates as well as testing rates were 0.473 and 0.398 for US states and 0.488 and 0.395 for the various countries, respectively (all P<0.0001).

440,Therapeutic activity of an inhaled potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human monoclonal antibody in hamsters,"SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract, enabling transmission and often leading to substantial lung pathology. Delivering the antiviral treatment directly to the lungs has the potential to improve lung bioavailability and dosing efficiency. As the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) is increasingly deemed to be a clinically validated target, RBD-specific B cells were isolated from patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection to derive a panel of fully human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The most potent hmAb, 1212C2 was derived from an IgM memory B cell, has high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD which enables its direct inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2. The 1212C2 hmAb exhibits in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic activity against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters when delivered intraperitoneally, achieving a meaningful reduction in upper and lower respiratory viral burden and lung pathology. Furthermore, liquid nebulized inhale treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters with as low as 0.6 mg/kg of inhaled dose, corresponding to approximately 0.03 mg/kg of lung deposited dose, mediated a reduction in respiratory viral burden that is below the detection limit, and mitigated lung pathology. The therapeutic efficacy achieved at an exceedingly low-dose of inhaled 1212C2 supports the rationale for local lung delivery and achieving dose-sparing benefits as compared to the conventional parenteral route of administration. Taken together, these results warrant an accelerated clinical development of 1212C2 hmAb formulated and delivered via inhalation for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Michael S Piepenbrink; Jun-Gyu Park; Fatai Oladunni; Ashlesha Deshpande; Madhubanti Basu; Sanghita Sarkar; Andreas Loos; Jennifer Woo; Phillip Lovalenti; Derek Sloan; Chengjin Ye; Kevin Chiem; Nathaniel B Erdmann; Paul A Goepfert; Vu L Truong; Mark R Walter; Luis Martinez-Sobrido; James J Kobie,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339150,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339150,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False
441,Co-infection of influenza A virus enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity,"The upcoming flu season in the northern hemisphere merging with the current COVID-19 pandemic raises a potentially severe threat to public health. Through experimental co-infection of IAV with either pseudotyped or SARS-CoV-2 live virus, we found that IAV pre-infection significantly promoted the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of cell types. Remarkably, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damage were observed in mice co-infected with IAV in vivo. Moreover, such enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was not seen with several other viruses probably due to a unique IAV segment as an inducer to elevate ACE2 expression. This study illustrates that IAV has a special nature to aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection, and prevention of IAV is of great significance during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Lei Bai; Yongliang Zhao; Jiazhen Dong; Simeng Liang; Ming Guo; Xinjin Liu; Xin Wang; Zhixiang Huang; Xiaoyi Sun; Zhen Zhang; Lianghui Dong; Qianyun Liu; Yucheng Zheng; Danping Niu; Min Xiang; Kun Song; Jiajie Ye; Wenchao Zheng; Zhidong Tang; Mingliang Tang; Yu Zhou; Chao Shen; Ming Dai; Li Zhou; Yu Chen; Huan Yan; Ke Lan; Ke Xu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.335893,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.335893,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False
442,Simple rapid in vitro screening method for SARS-CoV-2 anti-virals that identifies potential cytomorbidity-associated false positives,"The international SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in an urgent need to identify new anti-viral drugs for treatment of COVID-19 patients. The initial step to identifying potential candidates usually involves in vitro screening. Here we describe a simple rapid bioassay for drug screening using Vero E6 cells and inhibition of cytopathic effects (CPE) measured using crystal violet staining. The assay clearly illustrated the anti-viral activity of remdesivir, a drug known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. A key refinement involves a simple growth assay to identify drug concentrations that cause cellular stress or ""cytomorbidity"", as distinct from cytotoxicity or loss of viability. For instance, hydroxychloroquine shows anti-viral activity at concentrations that slow cell growth, arguing that its purported in vitro anti-viral activity arises from non-specific impairment of cellular activities.",Kexin Yan; Daniel J Rawle; Thuy Le; Andreas Suhrbier,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.338541,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.338541,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False

Although viral RNA modification has been reported based on the transcriptome architecture, the types and functions of RNA modification are still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the roles of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in SARS-CoV-2. Our methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained m6A modification. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection not only increased the expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) but also altered its distribution. Modification of METTL3 expression by short hairpin RNA or plasmid transfection for knockdown or overexpression, respectively, affected viral replication. Furthermore, the viral key protein RdRp interacted with METTL3, and METTL3 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the presence of RdRp. RdRp appeared to modulate the sumoylation and ubiquitination of METTL3 via an unknown mechanism.

445,"ACIS, A Novel KepTide™, Binds to ACE-2 Receptor and Inhibits the Infection of SARS-CoV2 Virus in vitro in Primate Kidney Cells: Therapeutic Implications for COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a virus known as SARS-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Without a targeted-medicine, this disease has been causing a massive humanitarian crisis not only in terms of mortality, but also imposing a lasting damage to social life and economic progress of humankind. Therefore, an immediate therapeutic strategy needs to be intervened to mitigate this global crisis. Here, we report a novel KepTide (Knock-End Peptide) therapy that nullifies SARS-CoV2 infection. SARS-CoV2 employs its surface glycoprotein ""spike"" (S-glycoprotein) to interact with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for its infection in host cells. Based on our in-silico-based homology modeling study validated with a recent X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB ID:6M0J), we have identified that a conserved motif of S-glycoprotein that intimately engages multiple hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions with ACE-2 enzyme. Accordingly, we designed a peptide, termed as ACIS (ACE-2 Inhibitory motif of Spike), that displayed significant affinity towards ACE-2 enzyme as confirmed by biochemical assays such as BLItz and fluorescence polarization assays. Interestingly, more than one biochemical modifications were adopted in ACIS in order to enhance the inhibitory action of ACIS and hence called as KEpTide. Consequently, a monolayer invasion assay, plaque assay and dual immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that KEpTide efficiently mitigated the infection of SARS-CoV2 in vitro in VERO E6 cells. Finally, evaluating the relative abundance of ACIS in lungs and the potential side-effects in vivo in mice, our current study discovers a novel KepTide therapy that is safe, stable, and robust to attenuate the infection of SARS-CoV2 virus if administered intranasally.",Avik Roy; Gunnar Gottschalk; Konstance Knox; Chi Hao Luan; Jim Keating; Kris Kesler,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337584,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337584,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False

This study highlights novel protein sequences generated by shot gun sequencing protocols that could serve as potential antigens in the development of novel subunit vaccines and through a stringent inclusion criterion, we characterized these protein sequences and predicted their 3D structures. We found distinctly antigenic sequences from the SARS-CoV-2 that have led to identification of 4 proteins that demonstrate an advantageous binding with Human leukocyte antigen-1 molecules. Results show how previously unexplored proteins may serve as better candidates for subunit vaccine development due to their high stability and immunogenicity, reinforce by their HLA-1 binding propensities and low global binding energies.

447,Structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 degrades with temperature,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a resurgence of COVID-19 in winter.

Statement of Scientific SignificanceThe economic and public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are very significant. However scientific information needed to underpin policy decisions are limited partly due to novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. There is therefore an urgent need for mechanistic studies of both COVID-19 disease and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We show that individual virus particles suffer structural destabilization at relatively mild but elevated temperatures. Our nanoscale results are consistent with recent observations at larger scales.

448,"Obesity alters Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in lung, trachea, and esophagus in a sex-dependent manner: Implications for COVID-19","Obesity is a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. The underlying basis of this association is likely complex in nature. The host-cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important for viral cell entry. It is unclear whether obesity alters expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in the lower respiratory tract. Here, we show that: 1) Ace2 expression is elevated in the lung and trachea of diet-induced obese male mice and reduced in the esophagus of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 2) Tmprss2 expression is increased in the trachea of obese male mice but reduced in the lung and elevated in the trachea of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 3) in chow-fed lean mice, females have higher expression of Ace2 in the lung and esophagus as well as higher Tmprss2 expression in the lung but lower expression in the trachea compared to males; and 4) in diet-induced obese mice, males have higher expression of Ace2 in the trachea and higher expression of Tmprss2 in the lung compared to females, whereas females have higher expression of Tmprss2 in the trachea relative to males. Our data indicate diet- and sex-dependent modulation of Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in the lower respiratory tract and esophagus.

Here we describe the efforts to utilize an mRNA platform for rational design and evaluations of mRNA vaccine candidates based on Spike (S) glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Several mRNA constructs expressing various structural conformations of S-protein, including wild type (WT), a pre-fusion stabilized mutant (2P), a furin cleavage-site mutant (GSAS) and a double mutant form (2P/GSAS), were tested in a preclinical animal model for their capacity to elicit neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). The lead 2P/GSAS candidate was further assessed in dose-ranging studies in mice and Cynomolgus macaques. The selected 2P/GSAS vaccine formulation, now designated MRT5500, elicited potent nAbs as measured in two types of neutralization assays. In addition, MRT5500 elicited TH1-biased responses in both mouse and non-human primate species, a result that helps to address a hypothetical concern regarding potential vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory diseases associated with TH2-biased responses.

450,The viral protein NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper for shutting down host translation and fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation,"SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for Covid-19 pandemic. In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine  Achille heel of the virus.",Antonin Tidu; Aurelie Janvier; Laure Schaeffer; Piotr Sosnowski; Lauriane Kuhn; Philippe Hammann; Eric Westhof; Gilbert Eriani; Franck Martin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339515,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339515,2020-10-14,2020-10-14,,False
451,Use of convalescent serum reduces severity of COVID-19 in nonhuman primates,"Passive transfer of convalescent plasma or serum is a time-honored strategy for treating infectious diseases. Human convalescent plasma containing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is currently being used to treat COVID-19 patients. However, most patients have been treated outside of randomized clinical trials making it difficult to determine the efficacy of this approach. Here, we assessed the efficacy of convalescent sera in a newly developed African green monkey model of COVID-19. Groups of SARS-CoV-2-infected animals were treated with pooled convalescent sera containing either high or low to moderate anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers. Differences in viral load and disease pathology were minimal between monkeys that received the lower titer convalescent sera and untreated controls. However, and importantly, lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory compartments, reduced gross and histopathological lesion severity in the lungs, and reductions in several parameters associated with coagulation and inflammatory processes were observed in monkeys that received convalescent sera versus untreated controls.

452,Associations between governor political affiliation and COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States,"IntroductionAs the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly politicized in the United States (US), political party affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease. We examined differences in COVID-19 infection and death rates stratified by governor party affiliation across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC).

MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal analysis examining daily COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 through September 30, 2020, for each US state and DC. We fit a Bayesian negative binomial model to estimate adjusted daily risk ratios (RRs) and posterior intervals (PIs) comparing infection and death rates by gubernatorial (mayoral for DC) party affiliation. We adjusted for several state-level variables, including population density, age, race, poverty, and health.

ResultsFrom March to early June 2020, Republican-led states had, on average, lower COVID-19 incidence rates compared to Democratic-led states. However, on June 8, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had higher per capita COVID-19 incidence rates (RR=1.15, 95% PI: 1.02, 1.25). This trend persisted until September 30 (RR=1.26, 95% PI: 0.96, 1.51). For death rates, Republican-led states had lower average rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 13 (RR=1.22, 95% PI: 1.03,1.37) through September 30 (RR=1.74, 95% PI: 1.20, 2.24).

453,"Findings from serological surveys (in August 2020) to assess the exposure of adult population to SARS Cov-2 infection in three cities of Odisha, India.","BackgroundThere is always an uncertainty of epidemiological, serological infectivity and virulence of the emerging novel coronavirus. Antibody test can be used for assessing whether immunity has developed in the infected person after 5-7 days of illness and understand cumulative exposure levels to the infection, make inferences on the actual burden of infection, its geographical spread, effect on specific demographic/risk groups, gaps in testing and infection fatality rates.

ObjectiveTo estimate and compare the sero-prevalence, hidden prevalence and determine the demographic risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults in three largest cities of Odisha, India.

MethodologyThis was a population based cross sectional serological survey carried out in August 2020 in the three largest cities of the state of Odisha. Sample size per city was estimated to be 1500 and participants were enrolled from the community using multi-stage random sampling from 25 clusters from each city. Data was collected using ODK based tools by household visits and 3-4 ml of blood samples were collected after informed consent. Samples were transported to testing lab where Serum was separated and tested for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies using automated CLIA platform. Statistical analysis was done using R-software packages.

ResultsA total of 4146 participants from the 3 cities of Bhubaneswar (BBS), Berhampur (BAM) and Rourkela (RKL) participated. A total of 5635 households were approached and the average non response rate in the community was 17.4%. The gender weighted seroprevalence across the three cities was 20.78% (95% CI: 19.56%-22.05%). Seroprevalence was highest in BAM at 31.14% (95% CI: 28.69-33.66%) followed by 24.59% (95% CI: 22.39-26.88%) in RKL and 5.24% (95% CI: 4.10-6.58%) in BBS. While females reported a higher seroprevalence (22.8%) as compared to males (18.8%), there was no significant difference in seroprevalence across age groups. A majority of the seropositive participants were asymptomatic (93.87%). Among those who reported symptoms, the most common symptom was fever (68.89%) followed by cough (46.06%) and myalgia (32.67%). The case to infection ratio on the date of serosurvey was 1: 6.6 in BBS, 1:61 in BAM and 1:29.8 in RKL.

454,SARS-CoV-2 waves in Europe: A 2-stratum SEIRS model solution,"In order to design actionable SARS-CoV-2 strategies, we extended the SEIRS model to support stratified isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable individuals. At first, we forced isolation levels to be uniform, showing that daily deaths curves of all metropolitan areas in the analysis can be fitted using homogeneous Ro=3.3. In the process, we established the possibility that an extremely short infectiousness period of 2 days coupled with 5 days exposure may be responsible for the multiple deaths valleys observed during the weeks following lockdowns. Regardless of the infectiousness period, we realized that is possible to infer non-uniform isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable by forcing the model to match the <60 to >60 age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies. Since the serology ratio is more robust than absolute values, we argue immunity level estimations made in this way (Madrid 41%; Catalonia 23%; Brussels 70%; and Stockholm 62%) are closer to reality. In locations where we didnt find reliable serology, we performed immunity estimations assuming Spains serology ratio (Paris: 23%; London: 33%). We predict that, with the exception of Brussels, no location can return to normal life without having a second wave (albeit in Stockholm a smaller one). For locations far from the herd immunity threshold (HIT) we searched what isolation values allow to return to normal life in 90 days minimizing final deaths, shockingly all found isolations for healthy <60 were negative (i.e. coronavirus parties minimize final deaths). Then, assuming an ideal 1-day long vaccination campaign with a 77% efficacy vaccine, we compared predicted final deaths of those 90-day strategies for all possible vaccination dates with a 180-day long vaccine waiting strategy that imposes 0.40 mandatory isolation to healthy <60 and results in 0.65 isolation to vulnerable. We found that 180-day of mandatory isolations to healthy <60 (i.e. schools and workplaces closed) produces more final deaths if the vaccination date is later than (Madrid: Feb 23 2021; Catalonia: Dec 28 2020; Paris: Jan 14 2021; London: Jan 22 2021). We also modeled how average isolation levels change the probability of getting infected for a single individual that isolates differently than average. That led us to realize disease damages to third parties due to virus spreading can be calculated and to postulate that an individual has the right to avoid isolation during epidemics (SARS-CoV-2 or any other) if these damages can be covered with a novel proposed isolation exemption insurance policy. Finally we conclude that our 2-stratum SEIRS model is suitable to predict SARS-CoV-2 epidemic behavior and can be used to minimize covid-19 disease and isolations related damages.

455,Estimating COVID-19 cases and outbreaks on-stream through phone-calls,"One of the main problems in controlling COVID-19 epidemic spread is the delay in confirming cases. Having information on changes in the epidemic evolution or outbreaks rise before lab-confirmation is crucial in decision making for Public Health policies. We present an algorithm to estimate on-stream the number of COVID-19 cases using the data from telephone calls to a COVID-line. By modeling the calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional to infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with coefficient of determination R2 > 0.85. This result allows us to estimate the number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days before the lab results are available. We validate the algorithm with real data. We show how to use the algorithm to track on-stream the epidemic, and present the Early Outbreak Alarm to detect outbreaks in advance to lab results. One key point in the developed algorithm is a detailed track of the uncertainties in the estimations, since the alarm uses the significance of the observables as a main indicator to detect an anomaly. We present the details of the explicit example in Villa Azul (Quilmes) where this tool resulted crucial to control an outbreak on time.

Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemics first wave. However, there is a need to quantify this for individuals with particular vulnerabilities, including those with learning disabilities and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with potential neurodevelopmental disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services.

We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with potential neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with potential neurodevelopmental disorders over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. The largest declines in caseloads and total contacts were seen in Home Treatment Team, Liaison/A&E and Older Adult teams. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was an 103% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March (or a 282% increase if the 2-month period from 16th March to 15th May was considered alone).",Evangelia Martin; Eleanor Nuzum; Matthew Broadbent; Robert Stewart,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210625,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210625,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
457,EVALUATION OF ELEVEN IMMUNOCHROMATOGRAPHIC ASSAYS FOR SARS-CoV-2 DETECTION: INVESTIGATING DENGUE CROSS-REACTION,"BackgroundCOVID-19 disease (Coronavirus disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is widespread worldwide, affecting more than 11 million people globally (July 6th, 2020). Diagnostic techniques have been studied in order to contain the pandemic. Immunochromatographic (IC) assays are feasible and low cost alternative for monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in the population.

MethodsHere we evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of eleven different immunochromatographic tests in 98 serum samples from confirmed cases of COVID-19 through RT-PCR and 100 negative serum samples from blood donors collected in February 2019. Considering the endemic situation of Dengue in Brazil, we also evaluated the cross-reactivity with Dengue using 20 serum samples from patients with confirmed diagnosis for Dengue collected in early 2019 through four different tests.

ResultsOur results demonstrated agreement between immunochromatographic assays and RT-PCR, especially after 10 days since the onset of symptoms. The evaluation of IgG and IgM antibodies combined demonstrated a strong level of agreement (0.85) of IC assays and RT-PCR. It was observed cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 using four different IC assays for COVID-19 diagnosis. The specificity of IC assays to detected COVID-19 IgM antibodies using Dengue serum samples varied from 80% to 85%; the specificity of IgG detection was 100% and total antibody was 95%.

ConclusionsWe found high sensitivity, specificity and good agreement of IC assays, especially after 10 days onset of symptoms. However, we detected cross-reactivity between Dengue and COVID-19 mainly with IgM antibodies demonstrating the need for better studies about diagnostic techniques for these diseases.

458,What Specimen Urologists Should Be Most Concerned About ? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"ObjectiveInvestigating the infectivity of body fluid can be useful for preventative measures in the community and ensuring safety in the operating rooms and on the laboratory practices.

MethodsWe performed a literature search of clinical trials, cohorts, and case series using PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library, and downloadable database of CDC. We excluded case reports and searched all-language articles for review and repeated until the final drafting. The search protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database.

ResultsThirty studies with urinary sampling for viral shedding were included. A total number of 1,271 patients were enrolled initially, among which 569 patients had undergone urinary testing. Nine studies observed urinary viral shedding in urine from 41 patients. The total incidence of urinary SARS-CoV-2 shedding was 8%, compared to 21.3% and 39.5 % for blood and stool, respectively. The summarized risk ratio (RR) estimates for urine positive rates compared to the pharyngeal rate was 0.08. The pertaining RR urine compared to blood and stool positive rates were 0.20 and 0.33 respectively.

ConclusionsOur review concludes that not only the SARS-CoV-2 can be excreted in the urine in eight percent of patients but also its incidence may have associations with the severity of the systemic disease, ICU admission, and fatality rates. Moreover, the findings in our review suggest that a larger population size may reveal more positive urinary cases possibly by minimizing biases. However, it is important to notice that it is the naso-pharyngeal specimens, stool, and serum that show more possibilities to became positive, respectively.",M.

We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) detecting IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in 10 minutes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of this RDT. RT-PCR positive plasma samples (n=35) for SARS-CoV-2 and 97 negative control samples were studied. Diagnostic performance of IgG/IgM RDT was assessed using both gold standard RT-PCR and Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig. Overall, RDT sensitivity was 100% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 88-100%) and specificity 93% (95% CI: 85-97%). This IgG/IgM RDT done in plasma displays a high diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM in high COVID-19 prevalence settings.

461,Extracorporeal Blood Purification in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients: a prospective cohort study,"IntroductionCOVID-19 is characterised by hyperinflammation and coagulopathy. Severe cases often develop respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation and critical cases progressing to ARDS. Control of hyperinflammation has been proposed as a possible therapeutic avenue for COVID-19; extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) modalities offer an attractive mean to ameliorate maladaptive inflammation.

With this work, we describe the longitudinal variation of parameters of systemic inflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with blood purification using AN69ST (oXiris(R)) hemodiafilter.

MethodsWe performed a time-series analysis of 44 consecutive COVID-19 cases treated with the AN69ST (oXiris(R)) cytokine adsorbing hemodiafilter; we visualise longitudinal results of biochemical, inflammatory, blood gas- and vital sign parameters.

ResultsBlood purification was indicated for suspected hyperinflammation or hypercoagulation, (= CRP [&ge;] 100 mg/L and/or IL-6 [&ge;] 40 pg/mL and/or Ferritin [&ge;] 500 ng/mL and/or Lactate Dehydrogenase > 365 U/L or D-dimers > 2000 ng/mL). All patients were treated with [&ge;] 1 cycle extracorporeal continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVHF) with cytokine adsorbing hemodiafilter (CAH); of these, 30 severe patients received CVVHF-CAH within 4 - 12 hours of hospitalisation. Another 14 patients admitted with mild-to-moderate symptoms progressed to severe disease and placed on EBP during the course of hospitalisation. The treatment was associated with a reduction of Ferritin, C-reactive protein, Fibrinogen, several inflammatory markers and a resolution of numerous cytopenias. The observed mortality across the cohort was 36.3% across the cohort.

Despite strong efforts that have been taking place to control the pandemic globally, the virus is on the rise in many countries. Hence, this study assessed the maternal health care services utilization in the amid of the COVID-19 pandemic in West Shoa Zone, Central Ethiopia. Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 844 pregnant women or those gave birth in the last 6 months before the study. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through face-to-face interview using a semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of significant associations, and adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was employed for the strength and directions of association between the independent and outcome variables. A P-value of <0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. The prevalence of maternal health service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic was 64.8%. The odds of maternal health service utilization was higher among mothers who had primary (AOR=2.16, 95%CI: 1.29-3.60), secondary (AOR=1.97, 95%CI: 1.13-3.44), and college and above education (AOR=2.89, 95%CI: 1.34-6.22) than those who could not read and write. In addition, mothers who did travel 25-74 km (AOR= 0.37, 95%CI: 0.23-0.59) and 75-99 km (AOR= 0.10, 95%CI: 0.05-0.19) to reach health facility had a lower odds of maternal health service utilization than those who did travel < 24 km. Moreover, mothers who earn 1000-2000 (AOR= 3.10, 95%CI: 1.73-5.55) and > 2000 birr (AOR=2.66 95%CI: 1.52-4.64) had higher odds of maternal health service utilization than those who earn <500 birr. Similarly, the odds of utilizing maternal health service were higher among mothers who did not fear COVID-19 infection (AOR= 2.79, 95%CI: 1.85-4.20), who had not had to request permission from husband to visit the health facility (AOR= 7.24, 95%CI: 2.65-19.75), who had practiced COVID-19 prevention measure (AOR=5.82, 95%CI: 3.87-8.75), and used face mask (AOR= 2.06, 95% CI: 1.28-3.31) than their counterpart.

463,Duration of Oxygen Requirement and Predictors in Severe COVID-19 Patients in Ethiopia: A Survival Analysis,"AimTo estimate time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy and identify predictors among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

MethodsA prospective observational study was conducted among 244 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients from July to September, 2020. Frequency tables, KM plots, median survival times and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to assess the presence of a statistically significant association between time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy and the independent variables, where hazard ratio, P-value and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsMedian time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy among the studied population was 6 days. Factors that affect time to getting off supplemental oxygen therapy were age group (HR= 0.522, 95% CI= 0.323, 0.844, p-value=0.008 for [&ge;] 70 years) and shortness of breath (HR= 0.705, 95% CI= 0.519, 0.959, p-value=0.026).

ConclusionsAverage duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement among COVID-19 patients was 6 days and being 70 years and older and having shortness of breath were found to be associated with prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen therapy requirement.

465,COVID-19 trends in Colombian regions with the highest disease burden,"IntroductionCOVID-19 pandemic is currently the most significant global public health challenge, with more than 31 million cases reported to date. Colombia first reported COVID-19 cases in the country by early March 2020, and six months later it has reached [~]750,471 clinical cases, with significant regional differences in morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization rates.

AimsIdentify population characteristics and hospital capacity in the 13 municipalities with the highest disease notification and examine differences in cumulative reported cases, hospitalization, and mortality rates that may explain the regional differences.

Materials and methodsA multi-group ecological study was performed based on the information available from public databases. Notification of cases, hospitalization, and crude mortality and age-adjusted rates were calculated.

ResultsThe municipalities with the highest COVID-1 burden at different times during the study period displayed significant differences in population density and the proportion of elderly inhabitants, indigenous and afro descendants minorities; indices of unsatisfied basic needs and multidimensional poverty index, as well as the number of hospital beds. Likewise, essential variations in notification rates, hospitalization, and mortality were observed. The highest age-adjusted of reported cases (4,219 cases) and mortality (230.4 cases) rates were found in Leticia, the lowest general hospitalization rates in Buenaventura (37.5 cases) and the lowest ICU hospitalization rates (0) in Leticia and Tumaco due to a lack of these units in these municipalities.

466,"Using an Agent-Based Model to Assess K-12 School Re-openings Under Different COVID-19 Spread Scenarios - United States, School Year 2020/21","School-age children play a key role in the spread of airborne viruses like influenza due to the prolonged and close contacts they have in school settings. As a result, school closures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions were recommended as the first line of defense in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Assessing school reopening scenarios is a priority for states, administrators, parents, and children in order to balance educational disparities and negative population impacts of COVID-19. To address this challenge, we used an agent-based model that simulates communities across the United States including daycares, primary, and secondary schools to quantify the relative health outcomes of reopening schools. We explored different reopening scenarios including remote learning, in-person school, and several hybrid options that stratify the student population into cohorts (also referred to as split cohort) in order to reduce exposure and disease spread. In addition, we assessed the combined impact of reduced in-person attendance in workplaces (e.g., through differing degrees of reliance on telework and/or temporary workplace closings) and school reopening scenarios to quantify the potential impact of additional transmission pathways contributing to COVID-19 spread. Scenarios where split cohorts of students return to school in non-overlapping formats resulted in significant decreases in the clinical attack rate (i.e., the percentage of symptomatic individuals), potentially by as much as 75%. These split cohort scenarios have impacts which are only modestly lesser than the most impactful 100% distance learning scenario. Split cohort scenarios can also significantly avert the number of cases-approximately 60M and 28M-depending on the scenario, at the national scale over the simulated eight-month period. We found the results of our simulations to be highly dependent on the number of workplaces assumed to be open for in-person business, as well as the initial level of COVID-19 incidence within the simulated community. Our results show that reducing the number of students attending school leads to better health outcomes, and the split cohort option enables part-time in-classroom education while substantially reducing risk. The results of this study can support decisions regarding optimal school reopening strategies that at the population level balance education and the negative health outcomes of COVID-19.

467,Mathematical Modeling of COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent,"The present work aims to give a contribution to the understanding of the highly infectious pandemic caused by the COVID-19 in the African continent. The study focuses on the modelling and the forecasting of COVID-19 spread in the most affected African continent, namely: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and South Africa and for the sake of comparison two of the most affected European country are also considered, namely: France and Italy. To this end, an epidemiological SEIQRDP model is presented, which is an adaptation of the classic SIR model widely used in mathematical epidemiology. In order to better coincide with the preventive measures taken by the governments to deal with the spread of COVID-19, this model considers the quarantine. For the identification of the models parameters, official data of the pandemic up to August 1st, 2020 are considered. The results show that the number of infections due to the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided the isolation is effective. However, it is increasing in some countries with the early lifting of containment. Finally, the information provided by the SEIQRDP model could help to establish a realistic assessment of the short-term pandemic situation.

468,"Robust test and trace strategies can prevent COVID-19 resurgences: a case study from New South Wales, Australia","BackgroundThe early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, has the potential to spread exponentially. Therefore, as long as a substantial proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient countermeasures are in place. In this study, we examine the Australian state of New South Wales, a setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage, and a well-functioning test-and-trace system. We investigate how vulnerable the state would be to resurgences in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing, and mask usage.

MethodsWe use a stochastic agent-based model, calibrated to the New South Wales epidemic and policy environment, to simulate possible epidemic outcomes over October 1 - December 31, 2020, under a range of assumptions about contact tracing efficacy, testing rates, and mask uptake.

ResultsWe find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower (and vice versa). With very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case), we estimate that the epidemic would remain under control until at least the end of 2020, with as little as 70-110 new infections estimated over October 1 - December 31 under high mask uptake scenarios, or 340-1,400 without masks, depending on the efficacy of community contact tracing. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period would be up to 6 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 17 times higher if the testing rate was 65%, or more than 100 times higher with a 50% testing rate.

ConclusionsOur work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of controlling transmission in dynamic community settings. A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling community-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Robyn M Stuart; Romesh G Abeysuriya; Cliff C Kerr; Dina Mistry; Daniel J Klein; Richard Gray; Margaret Hellard; Nick Scott,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209429,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209429,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
469,The Characteristics of Health Care Workers with COVID-19 and Relationship Between COVID-19 Mortality and BCG/Tuberculosis History: a multi-center study,"BackgroundToday, COVID-19 pandemic has brought countries health services into sharp focus. Despite the low incidence of cases(1.2%) and high mortality rate(2.4%) among Turkish population, the low mortality rate(0.3%) despite the high incidence(11.5%) declared in healthcare workers drew our groups attention. Therefore, we aimed to report the characteristics of infected health-care workers and investigate the relationship between BCG vaccine and tuberculosis history with COVID-19 mortality in infected health-care worker population.

MethodThis study was conducted in three hospitals to assess the clinical presentations, disease severity and correlation with BCG vaccine and tuberculous history in COVID-19 positive health-care workers by an online questionnaire platform. The relationship between characteristics and tuberculosis history were investigated according to hospitalization status of the patients.

ResultTotal of 465 infected healthcare workers included in the study. The rate of history of direct care and contact to tuberculosis patient, presence of previous tuberculosis treatment and BCG scar, presence of radiological infiltrations was significantly higher in hospitalized healthcare workers. The ratio of direct care and direct contact to the patient with tuberculosis, and presence of family history of tuberculosis were statistically significantly higher in patients with radiological infiltrations.

ConclusionAlthough COVID-19 risk and incidence are higher among healthcare workers compared to the normal population due to higher virus load, this study brings evidence for the fact that the lower mortality rate seen in infected healthcare workers might be due to healthcare workers frequent exposure to tuberculosis bacillus and the mortality-reducing effects of BCG vaccine, despite the higher hospitalization rate and radiological infiltrations due to over-triggered immune system.",Serife Torun; Sevket OZKAYA; Nazan Sen; Fikret Kanat; Irem Karaman; Sebnem Yosunkaya; Ozlem Sengoren Dikis; Ali Asan; Selma Aydogan Eroglu; Sefa Semih Atal; Omer Ayten; Nimet Aksel; Hilal Ermis; Neslihan Ozcelik; Meryem Demirelli; Iskender Kara; Sua Sumer; Kamile Marakoglu; Fatih Uzer; Yasin Uyar; Tuba Cicek; Husamettin Vatansev; Berna Botan Yildirim; Tuba Kuruoglu; Aynur Atilla; Yasemin Ersoy; Bahar Kandemir; Yasemin Durduran; Fatma Goksin Cihan; Nur Demirbas; Fatma Yildirim; M Sule Akcay,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209403,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209403,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

Infection of neural stem cell-derived astrocytes changed energy metabolism, altered key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons and for biogenesis of neurotransmitters, and elicited a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability. Our data support the model where SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, infects astrocytes and triggers neuropathological changes that contribute to the structural and functional alterations in the brain of COVID-19 patients.",Fernanda Crunfli; Victor Corasolla Carregari; Flavio Protasio Veras; Pedro Henrique Vendramini; Aline Gazzola Fragnani Valenca; Andre Saraiva Leao Marcelo Antunes; Carolina Brandao-Teles; Giuliana da Silva Zuccoli; Guilherme Reis-de-Oliveira; Licia C.

471,Group Testing with Homophily to Curb Epidemics with Asymptomatic Carriers,"Non-technical summaryThe global fight against COVID-19 is plagued by asymptomatic transmission and false negatives. Group testing is increasingly recognized as necessary to fight this epidemic. I examine the gains from considering heterogeneous interpersonal interactions (homophily), which induce potential contamination, when designing testing pools. Homophily can be identified ex ante at a scale commensurate with pool size, so that the risk of contamination is higher within a well-designed pool than with an outsider. This makes it possible to overcome the usual information-theoretic limits of group testing which rely on an implicit homogeneity assumption. More importantly, group testing with homophily detects asymptomatic carriers that would be missed even by exhaustive individual testing because of false negatives. Such a strategy should be implemented at least at a weekly frequency to fit the time profile of test positivity. It can be used either to avoid unnecessary lockdowns or to make lockdowns more efficient.",Louis-Marie Harpedanne de Belleville,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210260,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20210260,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
472,Predicting mortality of individual COVID-19 patients: A multicenter Dutch cohort,"Objective: Develop and validate models that predict mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to the hospital. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: A multicenter cohort across ten Dutch hospitals including patients from February 27 to June 8 2020. Participants: SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (age [&ge;] 18) admitted to the hospital. Main Outcome Measures: 21-day mortality evaluated by the area under the receiver operatory curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The predictive value of age was explored by comparison with age-based rules used in practice and by excluding age from analysis. Results: 2273 patients were included, of whom 516 had died or discharged to palliative care within 21 days after admission. Five feature sets, including premorbid, clinical presentation and laboratory & radiology values, were derived from 80 features. Additionally, an ANOVA-based data-driven feature selection selected the ten features with the highest F-values: age, number of home medications, urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, oxygen saturation (%), oxygen saturation is measured on room air, oxygen saturation is measured on oxygen therapy, blood gas pH and history of chronic cardiac disease. A linear logistic regression (LR) and non-linear tree-based gradient boosting (XGB) algorithm fitted the data with an AUC of 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.85) and 0.82 (0.79 to 0.85), respectively, using the ten selected features. Both models outperformed age-based decision rules used in practice (AUC of 0.69, 0.65 to 0.74 for age > 70). Furthermore, performance remained stable when excluding age as predictor (AUC of 0.78, 0.75 to 0.81) Conclusion: Both models showed excellent performance and had better test characteristics than age-based decision rules, using ten admission features readily available in Dutch hospitals. The models hold promise to aid decision making during a hospital bed shortage.",Maarten C Ottenhoff; Lucas A Ramos; Wouter Potters; Marcus LF Janssen; Deborah Hubers; Dan Pina-Fuentes; Rajat Thomas; Iwan CC van der Horst; Christian Herff; Pieter Kubben; Paul WG Elbers; Henk A Marquering; Max Welling; Shi Hu; Suat Simsek; Martijn D de Kruif; Tom Dorman; Lucas M Fleuren; Michiel Schinkel; Peter G Noordzij; Joop P van den Bergh; Caroline E Wyers; David TP Buis; Joost Wiersinga; Ella HC van den Hout; Auke C Reidinga; Daisy Rusch; Kim CE Sigaloff; Renee A Douma; Lianne de Haan; Egill A Fridgeirsson; Niels C Gritters van de Oever; Roger JMW Rennenberg; Guido van Wingen; Marcel JH Aries; Martijn Beudel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20210591,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.10.20210591,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
473,Gargle-Direct: Extraction-Free Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) of Saline Gargle Rinse Samples,"BackgroundSaline mouth rinse/gargle samples have recently been shown to be a suitable option for swab-independent self-collection for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. We sought to evaluate a simplified process for direct reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) testing of this novel sample type and to compare performance with routine RT-qPCR using automated nucleic acid extraction.

MethodsClinical saline mouth rinse/gargle samples were subjected to automated nucleic acid extraction (""standard method""), followed by RT-qPCR using three assays including the FDA authorized US-CDCs N1/N2 assay, which was the reference standard for determining sensitivity/specificity. For extraction-free workflow, an aliquot of each gargle sample underwent viral heat inactivation at 65 {degrees}C for 20 minutes followed by RT-qPCR testing, without an intermediate extraction step. An in-house validated RT-qPCR lab developed test (LDT), targeting the SARS-CoV-2s S/ORF8 genes (SORP triplex assay) and the N1/N2 US-CDC assay was used to evaluate the extraction-free protocol. To improve the analytical sensitivity, we developed a single-tube hemi-nested (STHN) version of the SORP triplex assay.

ResultsA total of 38 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 75 negative saline mouth rinse/gargle samples were included in this evaluation. A 100% concordance in detection rate was obtained between the standard method and the extraction-free approach for the SORP assay. An average increase of +2.63 to +5.74 of the cycle threshold (CT) values was observed for both the SORP and N1/N2 assay when extraction-free was compared between the standard method. The average {Delta}CT [{Delta}CT=CT(Direct PCR)-CT(Extracted RNA)], for each of the gene targets were: S ({Delta}CT= +4.24), ORF8 ({Delta}CT=+2.63), N1 ({Delta}CT=+2.74) and N2 ({Delta}CT=+5.74). The {Delta}CT for the STHN SORP assay was +1.51 and -2.05 for the S and ORF8 targets respectively, when extracted method was compared to the standard method.

ConclusionOur Gargle-Direct SARS-CoV-2 method is operationally simple, minimizes pre-analytical sample processing and is potentially implementable by most molecular diagnostic laboratories. The empirical demonstration of single-tube hemi-nested RT-qPCR, to specifically address and alleviate the widely-acknowledged problem of reduced analytical sensitivity of detection of extraction-free templates, should help diagnostic laboratories in choosing Gargle-Direct protocol for high-throughput testing.",Peter Tilley; Vijay Gadkar; David M Goldfarb; Virginia Young; Nicole Watson; Ghada N.

474,Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection in recovered COVID-19 patients: studies based on cellular and structural biology analysis,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been reported in several virus infections including dengue fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. To study whether ADE is involved in COVID-19 infections, in vitro pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry into Raji cells, K562 cells, and primary B cells mediated by plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients were employed as models. The enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells was more commonly detected in plasma from severely-affected elderly patients with high titers of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. Cellular entry was mediated via the engagement of Fc{gamma}RII receptor through virus-cell membrane fusion, but not by endocytosis. Peptide array scanning analyses showed that antibodies which promote SARS-CoV-2 infection targeted the variable regions of the RBD domain. To further characterize the association between the spike-specific antibody and ADE, an RBD-specific monoclonal antibody (7F3) was isolated from a recovered patient, which potently inhibited SARS-Cov-2 infection of ACE-2 expressing cells and also mediated ADE in Raji cells. Site-directed mutagenesis the spike RBD domain reduced the neutralization activity of 7F3, but did not abolish its binding to the RBD domain. Structural analysis using cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) revealed that 7F3 binds to spike proteins at a shift-angled pattern with one ""up"" and two ""down"" RBDs, resulting in partial overlapping with the receptor binding motif (RBM), while a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that lacked ADE activity binds to spike proteins with three ""up"" RBDs, resulting in complete overlapping with RBM. Our results revealed that ADE mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies could result from binding to the receptor in slightly different pattern from antibodies mediating neutralizations. Studies on ADE using antibodies from recovered patients via cell biology and structural biology technology could be of use for developing novel therapeutic and preventive measures for control of COVID-19 infection.",Fan Wu; Renhong Yan; Mei Liu; Zezhong Liu; Yingdan Wang; Die Luan; Kaiyue Wu; Zhigang Song; Tingting Sun; Yunping Ma; Yuanyuan Zhang; Qimin Wang; Xiang Li; Ping Ji; Yaning Li; Cheng Li; Yanling Wu; Tianlei Ying; Yumei Wen; Shibo Jiang; Tongyu Zhu; Lu Lu; Yongzheng Zhang; Qiang Zhou; Jinghe Huang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209114,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209114,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
475,"Molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from Bangladesh: Implications in genetic diversity, possible origin of the virus, and functional significance of the mutations","In a try to understand the pathogenesis, evolution and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, scientists from all over the world are tracking its genomic changes in real-time. Genomic studies can be helpful in understanding the disease dynamics. We have downloaded 324 complete and near complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted in GISAID database from Bangladesh which were isolated between 30 March to 7 September, 2020. We then compared these genomes with Wuhan reference sequence and found 4160 mutation events including 2253 missense single nucleotide variations, 38 deletions and 10 insertions. The C>T nucleotide change was most prevalent (41% of all muations) possibly due to selective mutation pressure to reduce CpG sites to evade CpG targeted host immune response. The most frequent mutation that occurred in 98% isolates was 3037C>T which is a synonymous change that almost always accompanied 3 other mutations that include 241C>T, 14408C>T (P323L in RdRp) and 23403A>G (D614G in spike protein). The P323L was reported to increase mutation rate and D614G is associated with increased viral replication and currently most prevalent variant circulating all over the world. We identified multiple missense mutations in B-cell and T-cell predicted epitope regions and/or PCR target regions (including R203K and G204R that occurred in 86% of the isolates) that may impact immunogenicity and/or RT-PCR based diagnosis. Our analysis revealed 5 large deletion events in ORF7a and ORF8 gene products that may be associated with less severity of the disease and increased viral clearance. Our phylogeny analysis identified most of the isolates belonged to the Nextstrain clade 20B (86%) and GISAID clade GR (88%). Most of our isolates shared common ancestors either directly with European countries or jointly with middle eastern countries as well as Australia and India. Interestingly, the 19B clade (GISAID S clade) was unique to Chittagong which was originally prevalent in China. This reveals possible multiple introduction of the virus in Bangladesh via different routes. Hence more genome sequencing and analysis with related clinical data is needed to interpret functional significance and better predict the disease dynamics that may be helpful for policy makers to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.",Md Marufur Rahman; Shirmin Bintay Kader; S M Shahriar Rizvi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.336099,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.336099,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False
476,Structural basis for bivalent binding and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by human potent neutralizing antibodies,"Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represent promising candidates for clinical intervention against coronavirus virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19). We isolated a large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals capable of disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In order to understand the mechanism of these nAbs on neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, we have performed cryo-EM analysis and here report cryo-EM structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG or Fab forms bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the full-length IgG is found to associate with more RBD in the ""up"" conformation than the monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein. Comparison of large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially through revealing the bivalent binding and their correlation with more potent neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.",Renhong Yan; Ruoke Wang; Bin Ju; Jinfang Yu; Yuanyuan Zhang; Nan Liu; Jia Wang; Qi Zhang; Peng Chen; Bing Zhou; Yaning Li; Shuyuan Zhang; Long Tian; Xinyue Zhong; Lin Cheng; Xiangyang Ge; Juanjuan Zhao; Hong-wei Wang; Xinquan Wang; Zheng Zhang; Linqi Zhang; Qiang Zhou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.336800,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.336800,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False
477,Sequential infection with influenza A virus followed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to more severe disease and encephalitis in a mouse model of COVID-19.,"COVID-19 is a spectrum of clinical symptoms in humans caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has rapidly caused a pandemic. Coalescence of a second wave of this virus with seasonal respiratory viruses, particularly influenza virus is a possible global health concern. To investigate this, transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) were first infected with IAV followed by SARS-CoV-2. The host response and effect on virus biology was compared to K18-hACE2 mice infected with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 only. Infection of mice with each individual virus resulted in a disease phenotype compared to control mice. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis appeared significantly reduced in the sequentially infected mice, these mice had a more rapid weight loss, more severe lung damage and a prolongation of the innate response compared to singly infected or control mice. The sequential infection also exacerbated the extrapulmonary manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2. This included a more severe encephalitis. Taken together, the data suggest that the concept of  twinfection is deleterious and mitigation steps should be instituted as part of a comprehensive public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Jordan  J.

478,Degradation of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 by tobacco carcinogen-induced Skp2 in lung epithelial cells,"An unexpected observation among the COVID-19 pandemic is that smokers constituted only 1.4-18.5% of hospitalized adults, calling for an urgent investigation to determine the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) increase ACE2 mRNA but trigger ACE2 protein catabolism. BaP induces an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent upregulation of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp2 for ACE2 ubiquitination. ACE2 in lung tissues of non-smokers is higher than in smokers, consistent with the findings that tobacco carcinogens downregulate ACE2 in mice. Tobacco carcinogens inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudovirions infection of the cells. Given that tobacco smoke accounts for 8 million deaths including 2.1 million cancer deaths annually and Skp2 is an oncoprotein, tobacco use should not be recommended and cessation plan should be prepared for smokers in COVID-19 pandemic.",Guang-Biao Zhou; Gui-Zhen Wang; Qun Zhao; Fan Liang; Chen Zhang; Hui Zhang; Jun Wang; Zhen-Yin Chen; Ran Wu; Hong Yu; Bei-Bei Sun; Ruie Feng; Kai-Feng Xu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337774,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337774,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,False

The G614 variant has now replaced the D614-carrying virus as the dominant circulating strain. We report here cryo-EM structures of a full-length S trimer carrying G614, which adopts three distinct prefusion conformations differing primarily by the position of one receptor-binding domain (RBD). A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer, effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity. The loop transition may also modulate structural rearrangements of S protein required for membrane fusion.

480,"A 3D Structural Interactome to Explore the Impact of Evolutionary Divergence, Population Variation, and Small-molecule Drugs on SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein-Protein Interactions","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a global public health crisis. Vital to the development of informed treatments for this disease is a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions involved in disease pathology. One lens through which we can better understand this pathology is through the network of protein-protein interactions between its viral agent, SARS-CoV-2, and its human host. For instance, increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV can be explained by rapid evolution along the interface between the Spike protein and its human receptor (ACE2) leading to increased binding affinity. Sequence divergences that modulate other protein-protein interactions may further explain differences in transmission and virulence in this novel coronavirus. To facilitate these comparisons, we combined homology-based structural modeling with the ECLAIR pipeline for interface prediction at residue resolution, and molecular docking with PyRosetta. This enabled us to compile a novel 3D structural interactome meta-analysis for the published interactome network between SARS-CoV-2 and human. This resource includes docked structures for all interactions with protein structures, enrichment analysis of variation along interfaces, predicted {Delta}{Delta}G between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants for each interaction, predicted impact of natural human population variation on binding affinity, and a further prioritized set of drug repurposing candidates predicted to overlap with protein interfaces{dagger}.

481,Pilot production of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins in plants: a proof of concept for rapid repurposing of indoors farms into biomanufacturing facilities,"The current CoVid-19 crisis is revealing the strengths and the weaknesses of the worlds capacity to respond to a global health crisis. A critical weakness has resulted from the excessive centralization of the current biomanufacturing capacities, a matter of great concern, if not a source of nationalistic tensions. On the positive side, scientific data and information have been shared at an unprecedented speed fuelled by the preprint phenomena, and this has considerably strengthened our ability to develop new technology-based solutions. In this work we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were all engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs. Finally, for two of the antibodies we assayed a simple scale-up production protocol based on the extraction of apoplastic fluid. Our results indicate that gram amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be easily produced in little more than 6 weeks in repurposed greenhouses with little infrastructure requirements using N. benthamiana as production platform.

We conducted sero-prevalence study to estimate prior infection with with SARS-CoV-2 in Addis Ababa.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was done from April 23 to 28, 2020 among 301 randomly selected residents of Addis Ababa; with no known history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 person. Interviews on socio demographic and behavioural risk factor followed by serological tests were performed for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and IgG antibodies, using COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette. The test has sensitivity of 87{middle dot}9% and specificity of 100% for lgM; and a sensitivity of 97{middle dot}2% and specificity of 100% for IgG. RT-PCR test was also done on combined nasopharyngeal and oropharengeal swabs as an important public health consideration.

FindingsThe unadjusted antibody-based crude SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 7{middle dot}6% and the adjusted true SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was estimated at 8{middle dot}8% (95% CI 5{middle dot}5%-11{middle dot}6%) for the study population. Higher sero-prevalence were observed for males (9.0%), age below 50 years (8.2%), students and unemployed (15.6%), those with primary education (12.1%), smokers (7.8%), alcohol consumers (8.6%), chatt-chewers (13.6%) and shish smokers (18.8%). Seroprevalence was not significantly associated neither with socio-demographic not behavioral characteristics. According to the findings, possibly more individuals had been infected in Addis Ababa than what was being detected and reported by RT-PCR test suggestive of community transmission.

484,"Elevated antiviral, myeloid and endothelial inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19","The mechanisms that underpin COVID-19 disease severity, and determine the outcome of infection, are only beginning to be unraveled. The host inflammatory response contributes to lung injury, but circulating mediators levels fall below those in classical cytokine storms. We analyzed serial plasma samples from 619 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 recruited through the prospective multicenter ISARIC clinical characterization protocol U.K. study and 39 milder community cases not requiring hospitalization.

485,Estimating the impact of disruptions due to COVID-19 on HIV transmission and control among men who have sex with men in China,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic is impacting HIV care globally, with gaps in HIV treatment expected to increase HIV transmission and HIV-related mortality. We estimated how COVID-19-related disruptions could impact HIV transmission and mortality among men who have sex with men (MSM) in four cities in China.

MethodsRegional data from China indicated that the number of MSM undergoing facility-based HIV testing reduced by 59% during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside reductions in ART initiation (34%), numbers of sexual partners (62%) and consistency of condom use (25%). A deterministic mathematical model of HIV transmission and treatment among MSM in China was used to estimate the impact of these disruptions on the number of new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths. Disruption scenarios were assessed for their individual and combined impact over 1 and 5 years for a 3-, 4- or 6-month disruption period.

ResultsOur China model predicted that new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths would be increased most by disruptions to viral suppression, with 25% reductions for a 3-month period increasing HIV infections by 5-14% over 1 year and deaths by 7-12%. Observed reductions in condom use increased HIV infections by 5-14% but had minimal impact (<1%) on deaths. Smaller impacts on infections and deaths (<3%) were seen for disruptions to facility testing and ART initiation, but reduced partner numbers resulted in 11-23% fewer infections and 0.4-1.0% fewer deaths. Longer disruption periods of 4 and 6 months amplified the impact of combined disruption scenarios. When all realistic disruptions were modelled simultaneously, an overall decrease in new HIV infections was always predicted over one year (3-17%), but not over 5 years (1% increase-4% decrease), while deaths mostly increased over one year (1-2%) and 5 years (1.2 increase - 0.3 decrease).

ConclusionsThe overall impact of COVID-19 on new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths is dependent on the nature, scale and length of the various disruptions. Resources should be directed to ensuring levels of viral suppression and condom use are maintained to mitigate any adverse effects of COVID-19 related disruption on HIV transmission and control among MSM in China.",Ross D Booton; Gengfeng Fu; Louis MacGregor; Jianjun Li; Jason J Ong; Joseph D Tucker; Katy ME Turner; Weiming Tang; Peter Vickerman; Kate Mitchell,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209072,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209072,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
486,Characteristics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections among ambulatory and hospitalized children and adolescents in an integrated health care system in Tennessee,"BackgroundLittle is known regarding the full spectrum of illness among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection across ambulatory and inpatient settings.

MethodsActive surveillance was performed for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction among asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a quaternary care academic hospital laboratory in Tennessee from March 12-July 17, 2020. For symptomatic patients [&le;]18 years of age, we performed phone follow-up and medical record review to obtain sociodemographic and clinical data on days 2, 7, and 30 after diagnosis and on day 30 for asymptomatic patients [&le;]18 years. Daily and 7-day average test positivity frequencies were calculated for children and adults beginning April 26, 2020.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 was detected in 531/10327 (5.1%) specimens from patients [&le;]18 years, including 46/5752 (0.8%) asymptomatic and 485/4575 (10.6%) specimens from 459 unique symptomatic children. Cough (51%), fever (42%), and headache (41%) were the most common symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization was uncommon (18/459 children; 4%); no children with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period required intensive care unit admission. Symptom resolution occurred by follow-up day 2 in 192/459 (42%), by day 7 in 332/459 (72%), and by day 30 in 373/396 (94%). The number of cases and percent positivity rose in late June and July in all ages.

ConclusionsIn an integrated healthcare network, most pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections were mild, brief, and rarely required hospital admission, despite increasing cases as community response measures were relaxed.

487,A rapid and cost-effective multiplex ARMS-PCR method for the simultaneous genotyping of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clades,"Tracing the globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutants is essential for the outbreak alerts and far-reaching epidemiological surveillance. The available technique to identify the phylogenetic clades through high-throughput sequencing is costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive that hinders the viral genotyping in low-income countries. Here, we propose a rapid, simple and cost-effective amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-based multiplex reverse-transcriptase PCR assay to identify six distinct phylogenetic clades: S, L, V, G, GH, and GR. This approach is applied on 24 COVID-19 positive samples as confirmed by CDC approved real-time PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. Our multiplex PCR is designed in a mutually exclusive way to identify V-S and G-GH-GR clade variants separately. The pentaplex assay included all five variants and the quadruplex comprised of the triplex variants alongside either V or S clade mutations that created two separate subsets. The procedure was optimized in the primer concentration (0.2-0.6 {micro}M) and annealing temperature (56-60{degrees}C) of PCR using 3-5 ng/{micro}l cDNA template synthesized upon random- and oligo(dT)-primer based reverse transcription. The different primer concentration for the triplex and quadruplex adjusted to different strengths ensured an even amplification with a maximum resolution of all targeted amplicons. The targeted Sanger sequencing further confirmed the presence of the clade-featured mutations with another set of our designed primers. This multiplex ARMS-PCR assay is sample, cost-effective, and convenient that can successfully discriminate the circulating phylogenetic clades of SARS-CoV-2.",Md. Tanvir Islam; A. S. M.

488,Estimating the effect of social inequalities in the mitigation of COVID-19 across communities in Santiago de Chile,"We study the spatio-temporal spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Santiago de Chile using anonymized mobile phone data from 1.4 million users, 22% of the whole population in the area, characterizing the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the epidemic dynamics. We integrate these data into a mechanistic epidemic model calibrated on surveillance data. As of August 1st 2020, we estimate a detection rate of 102 cases per 1,000 infections (90% CI: [95 - 112 per 1,000]). We show that the introduction of a full lockdown on May 15th, 2020, while causing a modest additional decrease in mobility and contacts with respect to previous NPIs, was decisive in bringing the epidemic under control, highlighting the importance of a timely governmental response to COVID-19 outbreaks. We find that the impact of NPIs on individuals mobility correlates with the Human Development Index of comunas in the city. Indeed, more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after government interventions and experienced a significantly lower burden of the pandemic. The hetero-geneity of COVID-19 impact raises important issues in the implementation of NPIs and highlights the challenges that communities affected by systemic health and social inequalities face adapting their behaviors during an epidemic.",Nicolò Gozzi; Michele Tizzoni; Matteo Chinazzi; Leo Ferres; Alessandro Vespignani; Nicola Perra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20204750,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20204750,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
489,Estimating the Burden of COVID-19 Symptoms Among Participants at the 2020 USA Curling Club Nationals Tournament,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, with evidence suggesting that activities involving heavier breathing, such as singing and exercise, can result in increased risk for disease transmission. The USA Curling Club Nationals is a week-long curling tournament to determine the mens and womens club-level champions. The 2020 tournament took place March 7-14 at the Potomac Curling Club in Laurel, MD, and featured teams from across the United States. Preventative measures, such as increased cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, single use and disposable food containers, and canceling traditional event banquets were implemented. Despite these measures, players, coaches, officials, volunteers, and spectators contracted the virus as a result of participation in the event. We surveyed participants to assess total positivity, potential days of transmission, and the burden of symptoms experienced among the participants. We found that 55.6% of all participants reported experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, with nearly all experiencing more than one symptom. Although most participants symptoms resolved quickly, 9.6% of all participants experienced symptoms for at least one month and 12.6% of all participants reported taking at least 30 days before they felt they had returned to normal. As a result of this study, we believe curling tournaments have the potential to be high-risk events for the transmission of COVID-19. Further infection prevention measures that were not yet publicly implemented at the time of this tournament may be an effective method of lowering transmission risk, although further research is required.",Paul M Luethy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209437,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209437,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
490,Meta-analysis and adjusted estimation of COVID-19 case fatality risk in India and its association with the underlying comorbidities,"There is a lack of COVID-19 adjusted case fatality risk (aCFR) estimates and information on states with high aCFR. State-specific aCFRs were estimated, using 13-day lag for fatality. To estimate country-level aCFR, state estimates were meta-analysed. Multiple correspondence analyses (MCA), followed by univariable logistic regression, were conducted to understand the association between aCFR and geodemographic, health and social indicators. Based on health indicators, states likely to report a higher aCFR were identified. Using random- and fixed-effects models, the aCFRs in India were 1.42 (95% CI 1.19 - 1.70) and 2.97 (95% CI 2.94 - 3.00), respectively. The aCFR was grouped with the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and acute respiratory infections in the first and second dimensions of MCA. The current study demonstrated the value of using meta-analysis to estimate aCFR. To decrease COVID-19 associated fatalities, states estimated to have a high aCFR must take steps to reduce co-morbidities.

491,COVID-19 serological survey using micro blood sampling,"During August 2020, we carried out a serological survey among students and employees at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), Japan, testing for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We used a FDA-authorized 2-step ELISA protocol developed by the Krammer Lab (1, 2) in combination with at-home self-collection of blood samples using a custom low-cost finger prick-based capillary blood collection kit. Although our survey did not find any COVID-19 seropositive individuals among the OIST cohort, it reliably detected all positive control samples obtained from a local hospital and excluded all negatives controls. Among our controls, we found strong cross-reactivity of antibodies in samples from a serum pool from two MERS patients in the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S ELISA. Here we show that a centralized ELISA in combination with patient-based capillary blood collection using as little as one drop of blood can reliably assess the seroprevalence among communities. Anonymous sample tracking and an integrated website created a stream-lined procedure. Major parts of the workflow were automated on a liquid handler, demonstrating scalability.

492,Examining Unit Costs for COVID-19 Case Management in Kenya,"IntroductionCase management for COVID-19 patients is one of key interventions in country responses to the pandemic. Countries need information on the costs of case management to inform resource mobilization, planning and budgeting, purchasing arrangements, and assessments of the cost-effectiveness of interventions. We estimated unit costs for COVID-19 case management for patients with asymptomatic, mild to moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 disease in Kenya.

MethodsWe estimated per patient per day unit costs of COVID-19 case management for patients that are asymptomatic and those that have mild to moderate, severe, and critical symptoms. For asymptomatic and mild to moderate patients, we estimated unit costs for home-based care and institutional (hospitals and isolation centers). We used an ingredients approach, adopted a health system perspective and patient episode of care as our time horizon. We obtained data on inputs and their quantities from COVID-19 case management guidelines, home based care guidelines, and human resource guidelines, and augmented this with data provided by three public covid-19 treatment hospitals in Kenya. We obtained input prices for services from a recent costing survey of 20 hospitals in Kenya and for pharmaceuticals, non-pharmaceuticals, devices and equipment from market price databases for Kenya.

ResultsPer day per patient unit cost for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease under home based care are KES 1,993.01 (USD 18.89) and 1995.17 (USD 18.991) respectively. When these patients are managed in an isolation center of hospital, the same unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild to moderate disease are 7,415.28 (USD 70.29) and 7,417.44 (USD 70.31) respectively. Per day unit costs for patients with severe COVID-19 disease managed in general hospital wards and those with critical COVID-19 disease admitted in intensive care units are 12,570.75 (USD 119.16) and 59,369.42 (USD 562.79).

ConclusionCOVID-19 case management costs are substantial. Unit costs for asymptomatic and mild to moderate COVID-19 patients in home-based care is 4-fold lower compared institutional care of the same patients. Kenya will not only need to mobilize substantial resources to finance COVID-19 case management but also explore additional service delivery adaptations that will reduce unit costs.",Edwine Barasa; Angela Kairu; Wangari Nganga; Marybeth Maritim; Vincent Were; Samuel Akech; Mercy Mwangangi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209684,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209684,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
493,Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis and HIV services: a cross-sectional survey of 669 health professionals in 64 low and middle-income countries,"ObjectiveThe experiences of frontline healthcare professionals are essential in identifying strategies to mitigate the disruption to healthcare services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV professionals in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Between May 12 and August 6 2020, we collected qualitative and quantitative data using an online survey in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyse responses.

Findings669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey. Over 40% stated that it was either impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since COVID-19. The most common barriers reported to affect patients were: fear of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions and movement restrictions. 37% and 28% of responses about TB and HIV stated that healthcare provider access to facilities was also severely impacted. Strategies to address reduced transport needs and costs - including proactive coordination between the health and transport sector and cards that facilitate lower cost or easier travel - were presented in qualitative responses. Access to non-medical support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was severely disrupted according to 36% and 31% of HIV and TB respondents respectively; qualitative data suggested that the need for such services was exacerbated.

Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a healthcare professional would be more preferable for patients and health professionals. Saliva collection has been proposed as such a possible alternative sampling procedure. We evaluated the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on two different saliva collection devices (spitting versus swabbing) compared to nasopharyngeal swabs in over 2500 individuals that were either symptomatic or had high-risk contacts with infected individuals. We observed an overall poor sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (30.8% and 22.4% for spitting and swabbing, respectively). However, when focusing on individuals with medium to high viral load, sensitivity increased substantially (97.0% and 76.7% for spitting and swabbing, respectively), irrespective of symptomatic status.

We used a portable dehumidifier as a readily available and affordable tool to collect airborne virus in the condensate. The dehumidifiers were deployed in selected locations of a hospital ward with patients reporting flu like symptoms which could possibly be due to COVID-19 over three separate periods of one week. Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and confirmed using two independent assays.

499,"The risk for a new COVID-19 wave -- and how it depends on $R_0$, the current immunity level and current restrictions","The COVID-19 pandemic has hit different parts of the world differently: some regions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing a decline after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a second wave. The current immunity level i in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number R0), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on R0, i and the overall effect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying the minimal overall effect of preventive measures pMin needed to prevent a future outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level i plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different R0 and i it is shown that regions with lower R0 and low i may now need higher preventive measures (pMin) compared with other regions having higher R0 but also higher i, even when such immunity levels are far from herd immunity.",Tom Britton; Pieter Trapman; Frank G Ball,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209981,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209981,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True

Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic COVID-19 disease is important to provide targeted preventive and management practice. The aim of the study was to assess the determinants of having symptomatic disease among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.

MethodsA case-control study was conducted from August to September 2020 among a randomly selected 765 COVID-19 patients (372 Asymptomatic and 393 Symptomatic patients). Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the cases (symptomatic) and controls (asymptomatic), where p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the independent variables and developing symptomatic COVID-19 where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsThe result of the multivariable binary logistic regression shows that age group (AOR= 1.818, 95% CI= 1.210, 2.731, p-value=0.004 for 30-39 years; AOR= 1.611, 95% CI= 1.016, 2.554, p-value=0.043 for 40-49 years and AOR= 4.076, 95% CI= 2.582, 6.435, p-value=0.0001 for years and above), sex (AOR= 1.672, 95% CI= 1.216, 2.299, p-value=0.002) and history of diabetes mellitus (AOR= 2.406, 95% CI= 1.384, 4.181, p-value=0.002) were found to be significant factors that determine the development of symptomatic disease in COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsDeveloping a symptomatic COVID-19 disease was found to be determined by exposures of old age, male sex, and being diabetic. Therefore, patients with the above factors should be given enough attention in the prevention and management process, including inpatient management, to pick symptoms earlier and to manage accordingly so that these patients can have a favorable treatment outcome.",Tigist W Leulseged; Degu G Alemahu; Ishmael S Hassen; Endalkachew H Maru; Wuletaw C Zewde; Nigat W Chamesew; Kalkidan T Yegile; Daniel S Abebe; Firaol M Abdi; Etsegenet Y Menyelshewa; Tegenu G Gerbi; Helen T Hagos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209734,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.09.20209734,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
501,Explaining the Effective Reproduction Number of COVID-19 through Mobility and Enterprise Statistics: Evidence from the First Wave in Japan,"This study uses mobility statistics--a relatively novel data source consisting of smartphone location data--combined with business census data for the eight Japanese prefectures with the highest COVID-19 infection rates to study the effect of lockdown measures on the effective transmission rate of the virus. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to fully converge the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all the days), a 40-67% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, a 14-61% reduction in weekly mobility is needed.",Yoshio Kajitani; Michinori Hatayama,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209643,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20209643,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
502,COVID-19 Disease Severity and Determinants among Ethiopian Patients: A study of the Millennium COVID-19 Care Center,"BackgroundUnderstanding determinants of developing severe COVID-19 disease is important as studies show that severe disease is associated with worse outcomes.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to assess the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2020 among randomly selected 686 patients. Chi-square test was used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the patients based on disease severity (Mild Vs Moderate Vs Severe), where p-value of <0.05 was considered as having a statistically significant difference. A Multivariable multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a significant association between the independent variables and COVID-19 disease severity where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.

ResultsHaving moderate as compared with mild disease was significantly associated with having hypertension (AOR= 2.302, 95% CI= 1.266, 4.184, p-value=0.006), diabetes mellitus (AOR=2.607, 95% CI= 1.307, 5.198, p-value=0.007 for diabetes mellitus), fever (AOR= 6.115, 95% CI= 2.941, 12.716, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 2.695, 95% CI= 1.392, 5.215, p-value=0.003). Similarly, having severe disease as compared with mild disease was associated with age group (AOR= 4.428, 95% CI= 2.497, 7.853, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR=18.070, 95% CI=9.292, 35.140, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), sex (AOR=1.842, 95% CI=1.121, 3.027, p-value=0.016), hypertension (AOR= 1.966, 95% CI= 1.076, 3.593, p-value=0.028), diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.926, 95% CI= 1.964, 7.847, p-value=0.0001), fever (AOR= 13.218, 95% CI= 6.109, 28.601, p-value=0.0001) and headache (AOR= 4.816, 95% CI= 2.324, 9.979, p-value=0.0001). In addition, determinants of severe disease as compared with moderate disease were found to be age group (AOR= 4.871, 95% CI= 2.854, 8.315, p-value=0.0001 for 40-59 years and AOR= 18.906, 95% CI= 9.838, 36.334, p-value=0.0001 for [&ge;] 60 years), fever (AOR= 2.161, 95% CI= 1.286, 3.634, p-value=0.004) and headache (AOR= 1.787, 95% CI= 1.028, 3.107, p-value=0.039).

ConclusionsBeing old, male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and having symptoms of fever and headache were found to be determinants of developing a more severe COVID-19 disease category. We recommend a better preventive practice to be set in place so that these groups of patients can be protected from acquiring the disease. And for those who are already infected, a more careful follow-up and management should be given so that complication and death can be prevented.

Since SARS-CoV-2s entrance into the United States, numerous clinical laboratories and in vitro diagnostic companies have developed rRT-PCR assays, some requiring specialized materials and reagents. One such assay includes the cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Assay for use on the cobas(R) 6800/8800 (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.). Since initiation of this assay at our facility, our ability to run testing at full capacity has been limited due to restricted supply of the omni cobas(R) Processing Plate (Product Number 05534917001), a 96 deep well plate used for all sample processing and total nucleic acid extraction via MagNA Pure magnetic beads.

504,The SIR model estimates incorrectly the basic reproduction number for the covid-19 epidemic,"The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) becomes pandemic but presents different patterns in the world. To describe the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in each country or region, mathematical models were formulated aiming the estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. The simplest mathematical model, the SIR model, provided a lower estimation for R0, ranging from 1.5 to 3.0. However, more elaborate models, taking into account the natural history of covid-19, must be used to obtain a more reliable estimation of R0. One of the elaborated models presented here estimated a higher value for R0, that is, 6.54 and 5.88 for, respectively, Sao Paulo State (Brazil) and Spain. It is worth stressing that this model assumed that severe covid-19 cases were not participating in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain, which can not be assumed in the SIR model.",Hyun Mo Yang; Luis Pedro Lombardi Junior; Ariana Campos Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210831,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210831,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
505,Estimating epidemiologic dynamics from single cross-sectional viral load distributions,"Virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been central to the COVID-19 pandemic response, but interpreting changes in incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding the epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing practices. Here, we show that the distribution of viral loads, in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide accurate estimation of an epidemics trajectory, subverting the need for repeated case count measurements which are frequently obscured by changes in testing capacity. We identify a relationship between the population-level cross-sectional distribution of Ct values and the growth rate of the epidemic, demonstrating how the skewness and median of detectable Ct values change purely as a mathematical epidemiologic rule without any change in individual level viral load kinetics or testing. Although at the individual level measurement variation can complicate interpretation of Ct values for clinical use, we show that population-level properties reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. In support of these theoretical findings, we observe a strong relationship between the time-varying effective reproductive number, R(t), and the distribution of Cts among positive surveillance specimens, including median and skewness, measured in Massachusetts over time. We use the observed relationships to derive a novel method that allows accurate inference of epidemic growth rate using the distribution of Ct values observed at a single cross-section in time, which, unlike estimates based on case counts, is less susceptible to biases from delays in test results and from changing testing practices. Our findings suggest that instead of discarding individual Ct values from positive specimens, incorporation of viral loads into public health data streams offers a new approach for real-time resource allocation and assessment of outbreak mitigation strategies, even where repeat incidence data is not available. Ct values or similar viral load data should be regularly reported to public health officials by testing centers and incorporated into monitoring programs.",James A Hay; Lee Kennedy-Shaffer; Sanjat Kanjilal; Marc Lipsitch; Michael J Mina,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20204222,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.08.20204222,2020-10-13,2020-10-13,,True
506,Within-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, is evolving into different genetic variants by accumulating mutations as it spreads globally. In addition to this diversity of consensus genomes across patients, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within individual hosts, and co-existing viral variants may affect disease progression and the success of medical interventions. To systematically examine the intra-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we processed a large cohort of 3939 publicly-available deeply sequenced genomes with specialised bioinformatics software, along with 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We found that the distribution of diversity across patients and across genomic loci is very unbalanced with a minority of hosts and positions accounting for much of the diversity. For example, the D614G variant in the Spike gene, which is present in the consensus sequences of 67.4% of patients, is also highly diverse within hosts, with 29.7% of the public cohort being affected by this coexistence and exhibiting different variants. We also investigated the impact of several technical and epidemiological parameters on genetic heterogeneity and found that age, which is known to be correlated with poor disease outcomes, is a significant predictor of viral genetic diversity.

Author SummarySince it arose in late 2019, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) behind the COVID-19 pandemic has mutated and evolved during its global spread. Individual patients may host different versions, or variants, of the virus, hallmarked by different mutations. We examine the diversity of genetic variants coexisting within patients across a cohort of 3939 publicly accessible samples and 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We find that a small number of patients carry most of the diversity, and that patients with more diversity tend to be older. We also find that most of the diversity is concentrated in certain regions and positions of the virus genome. In particular, we find that a variant reported to increase infectivity is among the most diverse positions. Our study provides a large-scale survey of within-patient diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.",Jack Kuipers; Aashil  A Batavia; Kim Philipp Jablonski; Fritz Bayer; Nico Borgsmüller; Arthur Dondi; Monica-Andreea Drăgan; Pedro Ferreira; Katharina Jahn; Lisa Lamberti; Martin Pirkl; Susana Posada-Céspedes; Ivan Topolsky; Ina Nissen; Natascha Santacroce; Elodie Burcklen; Tobias Schär; Vincenzo Capece; Christiane Beckmann; Olivier Kobel; Christoph Noppen; Maurice Redondo; Sarah Nadeau; Sophie Seidel; Noemi Santamaria de Souza; Christian Beisel; Tanja Stadler; Niko Beerenwinkel,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335919,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335919,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,,False
507,Determinants of Time to Convalescence among COVID-19 Patients at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia: A prospective cohort study,"AimTo estimate time to recovery/convalescence and identify determinants among COVID-19 infected patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 360 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th July 2020. Kaplan Meier plots, median survival times, and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Association between time to recovery/ convalescence and determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard survival model, where hazard ratio, P-value, and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance.

ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 32.4 years ({+/-} 12.5 years). On admission, 86.9 % had mild COVID-19, 78.6% were asymptomatic and 11.4% of the patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness. The Median time to recovery/ convalescence among the study population was 16 days. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and severe) disease, having one or more symptoms at presentation, and presenting with respiratory and constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The Final Cox regression result shows that the presence of symptom at presentation was found to be a significant factor that affects time to recovery/ convalescence, the rate of achieving recovery/ convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040).

ConclusionsPresence of symptom was found to be associated with delayed viral clearance. This implies symptomatic patients are more likely to be infectious because of the prolonged viral shedding in addition to the presence of a more concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract that enhances the transmission. Therefore, attention should be given in the isolation and treatment practice of COVID-19 patients with regard to presence of symptom.

Key MessagesO_LIThe study assessed the time to RT-PCR proven recovery (two consecutive negative viral shedding) and identified determinants that affected the time.
C_LIO_LISymptomatic infection is associated with delayed viral clearance.
C_LIO_LIThe finding of the study could be used to guide the isolation and treatment practice.
