0,SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 escapes neutralization by South African COVID-19 donor plasma,"SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2, a novel lineage of the coronavirus causing COVID-19, contains multiple mutations within two immunodominant domains of the spike protein. Here we show that this lineage exhibits complete escape from three classes of therapeutically relevant monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore 501Y.V2 shows substantial or complete escape from neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma. These data highlight the prospect of reinfection with antigenically distinct variants and may foreshadow reduced efficacy of current spike-based vaccines.",Constantinos Kurt Wibmer; Frances Ayres; Tandile Hermanus; Mashudu Madzivhandila; Prudence Kgagudi; Bronwen E Lambson; Marion Vermeulen; Karin van den Berg; Theresa Rossouw; Michael Boswell; Veronica Ueckermann; Susan Meiring; Anne von Gottberg; Cheryl Cohen; Lynn Morris; Jinal N Bhiman; Penny L Moore,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427166,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427166,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
1,Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 pseudovirus by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera,"Recently, a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage called B.1.1.7 has emerged in the United Kingdom that was reported to spread more efficiently than other strains. This variant has an unusually large number of mutations with 10 amino acid changes in the spike protein, raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 16 participants in a previously reported trial with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had equivalent neutralizing titers to both variants. These data, together with the combined immunity involving humoral and cellular effectors induced by this vaccine, make it unlikely that the B.1.1.7 lineage will escape BNT162b2-mediated protection.",Alexander Muik; Ann-Kathrin Wallisch; Bianca Saenger; Kena A Swanson; Julia Muehl; Wei Chen; Hui Cai; Ritu Sarkar; Oezlem Tuereci; Philip R Dormitzer; Ugur Sahin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.426984,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.426984,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
2,mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants,"To date severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected nearly 100 million individuals resulting in over two million deaths. Many vaccines are being deployed to prevent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) including two novel mRNA-based vaccines. These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known. Here we report on the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.",Zijun Wang; Fabian Schmidt; Yiska Weisblum; Frauke Muecksch; Christopher O Barnes; Shlomo Finkin; Dennis Schaefer-Babajew; Melissa Cipolla; Christian Gaebler; Jenna A Lieberman; Zhi Yang; Morgan E Abernathy; Kathryn E Huey-Tubman; Arlene Hurley; Martina Turroja; Kamille A West; Kristie Gordon; Katrina G Millard; Victor Ramos; Justin Da Silva; Jianliang Xu; Robert A Colbert; Roshni Patel; Juan P Dizon; Irina Shimeliovich; Anna Gazumyan; Marina Caskey; Pamela J Bjorkman; Rafael Casellas; Theodora Hatziioannou; Paul D Bieniasz; Michel C Nussenzweig,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426911,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426911,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
3,Rapid protection from COVID-19 in nonhuman primates vaccinated intramuscularly but not intranasally with a single dose of a recombinant vaccine,"The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to exert a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10 days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, IN vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to control animals. While IM and IN vaccination both induced neutralizing antibody titers, only IM vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of IM-vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data demonstrates that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study.",Wakako Furuyama; Kyle Shifflett; Amanda N Pinksi; Amanda J Griffin; Friederike Feldmann; Atsushi Okumura; Tylisha Gourdine; Allen Jankeel; Jamie Lovaglio; Patrick W Hanley; Tina Thomas; Chad S Clancy; Ilhem Messaoudi; Andrea Marzi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.426885,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.426885,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
4,Native-like SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expressed by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 vaccine,"Vaccine development against the SARS-CoV-2 virus focuses on the principal target of the neutralizing immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein. Adenovirus-vectored vaccines offer an effective platform for the delivery of viral antigen, but it is important for the generation of neutralizing antibodies that they produce appropriately processed and assembled viral antigen that mimics that observed on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we describe the structure, conformation and glycosylation of the S protein derived from the adenovirus-vectored ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 vaccine. We demonstrate native-like post-translational processing and assembly, and reveal the expression of S proteins on the surface of cells adopting the trimeric prefusion conformation. The data presented here confirms the use of ChAdOx1 adenovirus vectors as a leading platform technology for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",Yasunori Watanabe; Luiza Mendonça; Elizabeth R.

5,Comprehensive mapping of SARS-CoV-2 interactions in vivo reveals functional virus-host interactions,"SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a major threat to global public health, resulting in global societal and economic disruptions. Here, we investigate the intramolecular and intermolecular RNA interactions of wildtype (WT) and a mutant ({Delta}382) SARS-CoV-2 virus in cells using high throughput structure probing on Illumina and Nanopore platforms. We identified twelve potentially functional structural elements within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, observed that identical sequences can fold into divergent structures on different subgenomic RNAs, and that WT and {Delta}382 virus genomes can fold differently. Proximity ligation sequencing experiments identified hundreds of intramolecular and intermolecular pair-wise interactions within the virus genome and between virus and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 binds strongly to mitochondrial and small nucleolar RNAs and is extensively 2'-O-methylated. 2'-O-methylation sites in the virus genome are enriched in the untranslated regions and are associated with increased pair-wise interactions. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a global decrease of 2'-O-methylation sites on host mRNAs, suggesting that binding to snoRNAs could be a pro-viral mechanism to sequester methylation machinery from host RNAs towards the virus genome. Collectively, these studies deepen our understanding of the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, cellular factors important during infection and provide a platform for targeted therapy.",Yue Wan; Siwy Ling Yang; Louis DeFalco; Danielle E Anderson; Yu Zhang; Ashley J Aw; Su Ying Lim; Xin Ni Lim; Kiat Yee Tan; Tong Zhang; Tanu Chawla; Yan Su; Alexander Lezhava; Paola de Sessions; Andres Merits; Lin-Fa Wang; Roland G Huber,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.427000,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.427000,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
6,Interferon-regulated genetic programs and JAK/STAT pathway activate the intronic promoter of the short ACE2 isoform in renal proximal tubules,"Summary: Recently, a short, interferon-inducible isoform of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), dACE2 was identified. ACE2 is a SARS-Cov-2 receptor and changes in its renal expression have been linked to several human nephropathies. These changes were never analyzed in context of dACE2, as its expression was not investigated in the kidney. We used Human Primary Proximal Tubule (HPPT) cells to show genome-wide gene expression patterns after cytokine stimulation, with emphasis on the ACE2/dACE2 locus. Putative regulatory elements controlling dACE2 expression were identified using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. qRT-PCR differentiating between ACE2 and dACE2 revealed 300- and 600-fold upregulation of dACE2 by IFN and IFN{beta}, respectively, while full length ACE2 expression was almost unchanged. JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib ablated STAT1 and dACE2 expression after interferon treatment. Finally, with RNA-seq, we identified a set of genes, largely immune-related, induced by cytokine treatment. These gene expression profiles provide new insights into cytokine response of proximal tubule cells.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426908,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426908,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
7,An all-solid-state heterojunction oxide transistor for the rapid detection of biomolecules and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein,"Solid-state transistor sensors that can detect biomolecules in real time are highly attractive for emerging bioanalytical applications. However, combining cost-effective manufacturing with high sensitivity, specificity and fast sensing response, remains challenging. Here we develop low-temperature solution-processed In2O3/ZnO heterojunction transistors featuring a geometrically engineered tri-channel architecture for rapid real-time detection of different biomolecules. The sensor combines a high electron mobility channel, attributed to the quasi-two-dimensional electron gas (q2DEG) at the buried In2O3/ZnO heterointerface, in close proximity to a sensing surface featuring tethered analyte receptors. The unusual tri-channel design enables strong coupling between the buried q2DEG and the minute electronic perturbations occurring during receptor-analyte interactions allowing for robust, real-time detection of biomolecules down to attomolar (aM) concentrations. By functionalizing the tri-channel surface with SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) antibody receptors, we demonstrate real-time detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein down to attomolar concentrations in under two minutes.",Yen-Hung Lin; Yang Han; Abhinav Sharma; Wejdan S.

8,The impact of Spike mutations on SARS-CoV-2 neutralization,"Multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown protective efficacy, which is most likely mediated by neutralizing antibodies recognizing the viral entry protein, Spike. Antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infection neutralize the virus by focused targeting of Spike and there is limited serum cross-neutralization of the closely-related SARS-CoV. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants are rapidly emerging, exemplified by the B.1.1.7, 501Y.V2 and P.1 lineages, it is critical to understand if antibody responses induced by infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or the current vaccines will remain effective against virus variants. In this study we evaluate neutralization of a series of mutated Spike pseudotypes including a B.1.1.7 Spike pseudotype. The analyses of a panel of Spike-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that the neutralizing activity of some antibodies was dramatically reduced by Spike mutations. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies in the serum of patients infected in early 2020 remained active against most mutated Spike pseudotypes. The majority of serum samples were equally able to neutralize the B.1.1.7 Spike pseudotype, however potency was reduced in a small number of samples (3 of 36) by 5-10-fold. This work highlights that changes in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike can alter neutralization sensitivity and underlines the need for effective real-time monitoring of emerging mutations and their impact on vaccine efficacy.",Chloe Rees-Spear; Luke Muir; Sarah A Griffith; Judith Heaney; Yoann Aldon; Jonne Snitselaar; Peter Thomas; Carl Graham; Jeffrey Seow; Nayung Lee; Annachiara Rosa; Chloe Roustan; Catherine F Houlihan; Rogier W Sanders; Ravindra K Gupta; Peter Cherepanov; Hans Stauss; Eleni Nastouli; Katie J Doores; Marit J van Gils; Laura E McCoy,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426849,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426849,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
9,Experimental re-infected cats do not transmit SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and responsible for the current global pandemic. We and others have previously demonstrated that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can efficiently transmit the virus to naive cats. Here, we address whether cats previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2. In two independent studies, SARS-CoV-2-infected cats were re-challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 21 days post primary challenge (DPC) and necropsies performed at 4, 7 and 14 days post-secondary challenge (DP2C). Sentinels were co-mingled with the re-challenged cats at 1 DP2C. Clinical signs were recorded, and nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs, blood, and serum were collected and tissues examined for histologic lesions. Viral RNA was transiently shed via the nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal cavities of the re-challenged cats. Viral RNA was detected in various tissues of re-challenged cats euthanized at 4 DP2C, mainly in the upper respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues, but less frequently and at lower levels in the lower respiratory tract when compared to primary SARS-CoV-2 challenged cats at 4 DPC. Histologic lesions that characterized primary SARS-CoV-2 infected cats at 4 DPC were absent in the re-challenged cats. Naive sentinels co-housed with the re-challenged cats did not shed virus or seroconvert. Together, our results indicate that cats previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be experimentally re-infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, the levels of virus shed was insufficient for transmission to co-housed naive sentinels. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats induces immune responses that provide partial, non-sterilizing immune protection against reinfection.",Natasha N Gaudreault; Mariano Carossino; Igor Morozov; Jessie D Trujillo; David A Meekins; Daniel W Madden; Konner Cool; Bianca Libanori Artiaga; Chester McDowell; Dashzeveg Bold; Velmurugan Balaraman; Taeyong Kwon; Wenjun Ma; Jamie Henningson; Dennis W Wilson; William C Wilson; Udeni BR Balasuriya; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; Juergen A Richt,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427182,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427182,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
10,A trans-complementation system for SARS-CoV-2,"The biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) requirement to culture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bottleneck for research and countermeasure development. Here we report a trans-complementation system that produces single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 that recapitulates authentic viral replication. We demonstrate that the single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput neutralization and antiviral testing. The trans-complementation system consists of two components: a genomic viral RNA containing a deletion of ORF3 and envelope gene, and a producer cell line expressing the two deleted genes. Trans-complementation of the two components generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round, but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose. The results suggest that the trans-complementation platform can be safely used at BSL-2 laboratories for research and countermeasure development.",Xianwen Zhang; Yang Liu; Jianying Liu; Adam L Bailey; Kenneth S Plante; Jessica A Plante; Jing Zou; Hongjie Xia; Nathen E Bopp; Patricia V Aguilar; Ping Ren; Vineet D Menachery; Michael S Diamond; Scott C Weaver; Xuping Xie; Pei-Yong Shi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.426970,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.426970,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
11,Azithromycin Plus Zinc Sulfate Rapidly and Synergistically Suppresses IκBα-Mediated In Vitro Human Airway Cell ACE2 Expression for SARS-CoV-2 Entry,"Large-scale efforts have been persistently undertaken for medical prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 disasters worldwide. A variety of novel viral spike protein-targeted vaccine preparations have recently been clinically distributed based on accelerated approval. We revisited the early but inconclusive clinical interest in the combination of azithromycin and zinc sulfate repurposing with safety advantages. In vitro proof of concept was provided for rapid and synergistic suppression of ACE2 expression following treatments in human airway cells, Calu-3 and H322M.

12,BRD2 inhibition blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro by reducing transcription of the host cell receptor ACE2,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells is initiated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its cell-surface receptor ACE2. We conducted an unbiased CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways controlling Spike protein binding to human cells. We found that the protein BRD2 is an essential node in the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription in human lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently evaluated in clinical trials potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells. BRD2 also controls transcription of several other genes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the interferon response, which in turn regulates ACE2 levels. It is possible that the previously reported interaction between the viral E protein and BRD2 evolved to manipulate the transcriptional host response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results pinpoint BRD2 as a potent and essential regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential of BRD2 as a novel therapeutic target for COVID-19.",Ruilin Tian; Avi J Samelson; Veronica V Rezelj; Merissa Chen; Gokul N Ramadoss; Xiaoyan Guo; Alice Mac Kain; Quang Dinh Tran; Shion A Lim; Irene Lui; James Nunez; Sarah J Rockwood; Na Liu; Jared Carlson-Stevermer; Jennifer Oki; Travis Maures; Kevin Holden; Jonathan S Weissman; James A Wells; Bruce Conklin; Marco Vignuzzi; Martin Kampmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427194,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427194,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
13,Sterically-Confined Rearrangements of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Control Cell Invasion,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious, and transmission involves a series of processes that may be targeted by vaccines and therapeutics. During transmission, host cell invasion is controlled by a large-scale conformational change of the Spike protein. This conformational rearrangement leads to membrane fusion, which creates transmembrane pores through which the viral genome is passed to the host. During Spike-protein-mediated fusion, the fusion peptides must be released from the core of the protein and associate with the host membrane. Interestingly, the Spike protein possesses many post-translational modifications, in the form of branched glycans that flank the surface of the assembly. Despite the large number of glycosylation sites, until now, the specific role of glycans during cell invasion has been unclear. Here, we propose that glycosylation is needed to provide sufficient time for the fusion peptides to reach the host membrane, otherwise the viral particle would fail to enter the host. To understand this process, an all-atom model with simplified energetics was used to perform thousands of simulations in which the protein transitions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These simulations indicate that the steric composition of the glycans induces a pause during the Spike protein conformational change. We additionally show that this glycan-induced delay provides a critical opportunity for the fusion peptides to capture the host cell. This previously-unrecognized role of glycans reveals how the glycosylation state can regulate infectivity of this pervasive pathogen.",Esteban Dodero Rojas; Jose Nelson Onuchic; Paul Whitford,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427189,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427189,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
14,SARS-CoV-2 infection of circulating immune cells is not responsible for virus dissemination in severe COVID-19 patients,"In late 2019 a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged, and has since caused a global pandemic. Understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease is necessary to inform development of therapeutics, and management of infected patients. Using scRNAseq of blood drawn from SARS-CoV-2 patients, we asked whether SARS-CoV-2 may exploit immune cells as a 'Trojan Horse' to disseminate and access multiple organ systems. Our data suggests that circulating cells are not actively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and do not appear to be a source of viral dissemination.",Nicole L Rosin; Arzina Jaffer; Sarthak Sinha; Rory P Mulloy; Carolyn Robinson; Elodie Labit; Luiz G Almeida; Antoine Dufour; Jennifer A Corcoran; Bryan Yipp; Jeff Biernaskie,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427282,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427282,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
15,Acute Endotheliitis (Type 3 Hypersensitivity Vasculitis) in Ten COVID-19 Autopsy Brains,"Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in COVID-19 may occur through direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion through peripheral or cranial nerves or through vascular endothelial cell infection. The renin-angiotensin system may play a major part in CNS morbidity. Effects of hypoxia have also been implicated in CNS lesions in COVID-19. This communication reports on ten consecutive autopsies of individuals with death due to COVID-19 with decedent survival ranging from 30 minutes to 84 days after admission. All ten brains examined had neutrophilic microvascular endotheliitis present in variable amounts and variably distributed. Importantly, this acute stage of type 3 hypersensitivity vasculitis can be followed by fibrinoid necrosis and inner vascular wall sclerosis, but these later stages were not found. These results suggest that a vasculitis with autoimmune features occurred in all ten patients. It is possible that viral antigen in or on microvascular walls or other antigen-antibody complexes occurred in all ten patients proximate to death as a form of autoimmune vasculitis.",Roy H Rhodes; Gordon L Love; Fernanda Da Silve Lameira; Maryam Sadough Shahmirzadi; Sharon E Fox; Richard S Vander Heide,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.21249632,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.21249632,2021-01-18,2021-01-18,,True
16,Correlates of and changes in aerobic physical activity and strength training before and after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Findings from the HEBECO study.,"ObjectivesUnderstanding changes in moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity (MVPA) and strength training (MSA) from before to after (pre-/post-) the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK (first lockdown) and their correlates can inform interventions.

MethodsCross-sectional analysis of retrospective and concurrent data on MVPA/MSA pre- and post-Covid-19 (until 14th June 2020) among 2,657 UK adults. The associations between socio-demographic and health characteristics, MVPA/MSA pre-Covid-19, living and exercise conditions and meeting WHO recommended levels for MVPA/MSA/both (vs meeting neither), and changes in MVPA/MSA from pre-to post-Covid-19 following stratification for pre-Covid-19 MVPA/MSA levels were evaluated.

ResultsA third of adults maintained (30.4%), decreased (36.2%) or increased (33.4%) their MVPA levels post-Covid-19. For MSA, the percentages were 61.6%, 18.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. MVPA increased or decreased by an average of 150min/week, and MSA by 2 days/week. Meeting both MSA+MVPA recommendations during lockdown (vs. meeting neither) was positively associated with meeting MVPA+MSA pre-lockdown (aOR=16.11,95%CI=11.24-23.07), and post-16-years of age education (aOR=1.57,1.14-2.17), and negatively associated with being obese (aOR=0.49,0.33-0.73), older age (65+ vs [&le;]34; aOR=.53.32-.87), and annual household income <50.000GBP (vs [&ge;]50.000GBP; aOR=0.65,0.46-0.91). The odds for decreasing MVPA were significantly lower for white ethnicity, post-16-years of age education, access to garden/balcony, and higher for those who were in total isolation. The odds for decreasing MSA were significantly higher for those who were overweight or obese.

ConclusionAerobic and strength training were differently impacted during the first UK lockdown, with poorer outcomes associated with older age, lower education, and higher body mass index.

17,Fluorescent Glycan Fingerprinting of SARS2 Spike Proteins,"Glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification and has myriad biological functions. However, glycan analysis and research has always been a challenge. Here, we would like to present new techniques of glycan fingerprinting based on enzymatic fluorescent labeling and gel electrophoresis. The method is illustrated on SARS-2 spike (S) glycoproteins. SARS-2, a novel coronavirus and the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, has devastated the world since the end of 2019. To obtain the N-glycan fingerprint of a S protein, glycans released from the protein are first labeled through enzymatic incorporation of fluorophore-conjugated sialic acid or fucose, and then separated on acrylamide gel through electrophoresis, and finally visualized with a fluorescent imager. To identify the labeled glycans of a fingerprint, glycan standards and glycan ladders that are enzymatically generated are run alongside the samples as references. By comparing the mobility of a labeled glycan to that of a glycan standard, the identity of glycans maybe determined. Due to lack of enzyme for broad O-glycans releasing, O-glycans on the RBD protein are labeled with fluorescent sialic acid and digested with trypsin to obtain labeled glycan peptides that are then separated on gel. Glycan fingerprinting could serve as a quick way for global assessment of the glycosylation of a glycoprotein.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.426965,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.426965,2021-01-18,2021-01-18,,False
18,SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY: a multi-platform open-source bioinformatic pipeline for the automatic construction and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from NGS sequencing data,"Background: Since its first appearance in December 2019, the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARSCoV2), spread worldwide causing an increasing number of cases and deaths (35,537,491 and 1,042,798, respectively at the time of writing, https://covid19.who.int). Similarly, the number of complete viral genome sequences produced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), increased exponentially. NGS enables a rapid accumulation of a large number of sequences. However, bioinformatics analyses are critical and require combined approaches for data analysis, which can be challenging for non bioinformaticians. Results: A user friendly and sequencing platform-independent bioinformatics pipeline, named SARSCoV2 RECoVERY (REconstruction of CoronaVirus gEnomes & Rapid analYsis) has been developed to build SARSCoV2 complete genomes from raw sequencing reads and to investigate variants. The genomes built by SARSCoV2 RECoVERY were compared with those obtained using other software available and revealed comparable or better performances of SARSCoV2 RECoVERY. Depending on the number of reads, the complete genome reconstruction and variants analysis can be achieved in less than one hour. The pipeline was implemented in the multi usage open source Galaxy platform allowing an easy access to the software and providing computational and storage resources to the community. Conclusions: SARSCoV2 RECoVERY is a piece of software destined to the scientific community working on SARSCoV2 phylogeny and molecular characterisation, providing a performant tool for the complete reconstruction and variants analysis of the viral genome. Additionally, the simple software interface and the ability to use it through a Galaxy instance without the need to implement computing and storage infrastructures, make SARSCoV2 RECoVERY a resource also for virologists with little or no bioinformatics skills. Availability and implementation: The pipeline SARSCoV2 RECoVERY (REconstruction of COronaVirus gEnomes & Rapid analYsis) is implemented in the Galaxy instance ARIES (https://aries.iss.it).",Luca De Sabato; Gabriele Vaccari; Arnold Knijn; Giovanni Ianiro; Ilaria Di Bartolo; Stefano Morabito,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.425365,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.425365,2021-01-18,2021-01-18,,False
19,SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces Krüppel-Like Factor 2 in human lung autopsy,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred in ~12% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a recent New York City cohort. Pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, characterized by increased expression of inflammatory genes and increased monolayer permeability, is a major component of ARDS. Vascular leak results in parenchymal accumulation of leukocytes, protein, and extravascular water, leading to pulmonary edema, ischemia, and activation of coagulation associated with COVID-19. Endothelial inflammation further contributes to uncontrolled cytokine storm in ARDS. We have recently demonstrated that Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a transcription factor which promotes endothelial quiescence and monolayer integrity, is significantly reduced in experimental models of ARDS. Lung inflammation and high-tidal volume ventilation result in reduced KLF2, leading to pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and acute lung injury. Mechanistically, we found that KLF2 is a potent transcriptional activator of Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (RAPGEF3) which orchestrates and maintains vascular integrity. Moreover, KLF2 regulates multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS)-implicated ARDS genes. Whether lung KLF2 is regulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here we report that endothelial KLF2 is significantly reduced in human lung autopsies from COVID-19 patients, which supports that ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 is a vascular phenotype possibly attributed to KLF2 down-regulation. We provide additional data demonstrating that KLF2 is down-regulated in SARS-CoV infection in mice.",Tzu-Han Lee; David Wu; Robert Guzy; Nathan Schoettler; Ayodeji Adegunsoye; Jeffrey Mueller; Aliya Hussein; Anne Sperling; Gokhan M Mutlu; Yun Fang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426691,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426691,2021-01-18,2021-01-18,,False
20,Tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for Developing Human Cortical Astrocytes,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) readily infects a variety of cell types impacting the function of vital organ systems, with particularly severe impact on respiratory function. It proves fatal for one percent of those infected. Neurological symptoms, which range in severity, accompany a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases, indicating a potential vulnerability of neural cell types. To assess whether human cortical cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, we utilized primary human cortical tissue and stem cell-derived cortical organoids. We find significant and predominant infection in cortical astrocytes in both primary and organoid cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical populations. Infected astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity characteristics, growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, including astrocytes, have minimal ACE2 expression, we find high levels of alternative coronavirus receptors in infected astrocytes, including DPP4 and CD147. Inhibition of DPP4 reduced infection and decreased expression of the cell stress marker, ARCN1. We find tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for human astrocytes mediated by DPP4, resulting in reactive gliosis-type injury.",Madeline G Andrews; Tanzila Mukhtar; Ugomma C Eze; Camille R Simoneau; Yonatan Perez; Mohammed A Mostajo-Radji; Shaohui Wang; Dmitry Velmeshev; Jahan Salma; G.

21,"From COVID-19 to the Common Cold: Novel Host-Targeted, Pan-Respiratory Antiviral Small Molecule Therapeutics","Antiviral compounds displaying remarkable features have been identified by an unconventional drug screen and advanced through animal validation. Efficacy is observed against the six viral families causing most human respiratory viral disease, irrespective of strain, including both influenza (FLUV) and SARS-CoV-2, with cell culture EC50 at or below 100 nM. Survival benefit is demonstrated in pigs against another member of family Coronaviridae, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and shown equally effective in mild and severe disease. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) titer is reduced by drug treatment in cotton rats. A substantial barrier to viral resistance is demonstrated for FLUV. Drug resin affinity chromatography (DRAC) reveals a novel drug target: a multi-protein complex (MPC) formed transiently, in an energy-dependent fashion, and composed of host proteins implicated in both viral lifecycles and manipulation of innate immunity. The protein composition of this host MPC is modified upon viral infection, with increase or decrease of some proteins and appearance or complete loss of others. Valosin-containing protein, also known as Transitional endoplasmatic reticulum ATPase (VCP/p97), is present in the target MPC of uninfected cells and significantly increased in both FLUV and CoV infection. SQSTM1/p62, a key regulator of the autophagy pathway of innate immunity whose dysfunction is implicated in cytokine storm, is i) found in the target MPC from uninfected cells, ii) diminished in DRAC eluates by infection, and iii) restored by drug treatment of infected cells. 14-3-3 is one of likely several proteins that comprise the drug-binding site. Advanced compounds with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and lung exposure are approaching criteria for a Target Product Profile. We propose these novel drug targets to comprise a previously unappreciated molecular basis for homeostasis that is modified by viruses to allow exploitation for viral propagation and is restored by treatment with the therapeutic compounds presented. This discovery has transformative implications for treatment of respiratory viral-related disease, applicable to everything from seasonal FLUV to COVID-19 and future novel respiratory viruses, due to the pan-family nature of drug activity and barrier to resistance development.",Suganya Selvarajah; Anuradha F Lingappa; Maya Michon; Shao Feng Yu; Amanda Macieik; Suguna Mallesh; Umesh Appiah; Jackelyn Crabtree; Kiel Copeland; Jim Lin; Olayemi Akintunde; Christine Nichols; Emma Petrouski; A.

22,Large scale genomic and evolutionary study reveals SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates from Bangladesh strongly correlate with European origin and not with China.,"RationaleThe global public health is in serious crisis due to emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Studies are ongoing to reveal the genomic variants of the virus circulating in various parts of the world. However, data generated from low- and middle-income countries are scarce due to resource limitation. This study was focused to perform whole genome sequencing of 151 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive Bangladeshi patients. The goal of this study was to identify the genomic variants among the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates in Bangladesh, to determine the molecular epidemiology and to develop a relationship between host clinical trait with the virus genomic variants.

MethodSuspected patients were tested for COVID-19 using one step commercial qPCR kit for SARS-CoV-2 Virus. Viral RNA was extracted from positive patients, converted to cDNA which was amplified using Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel. Massive parallel sequencing was carried out using Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit Plus. Assembly of raw data is done by aligning the reads to a pre-defined reference genome (NC_045512.2) while retaining the unique variations of the input raw data by creating a consensus genome. A random forest-based association analysis was carried out to correlate the viral genomic variants with the clinical traits present in the host.

ResultAmong the 151 viral isolates, we observed the 413 unique variants. Among these 8 variants occurred in more than 80 % of cases which include 241C to T, 1163A to T, 3037C to T,14408C to T, 23403A to G, 28881G to A, 28882 G to A, and finally the 28883G to C. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a predominance of variants belonging to GR clade, which have a strong geographical presence in Europe, indicating possible introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into Bangladesh through a European channel. However, other possibilities like a route of entry from China cannot be ruled out as viral isolate belonging to L clade with a close relationship to Wuhan reference genome was also detected. We observed a total of 37 genomic variants to be strongly associated with clinical symptoms such as fever, sore throat, overall symptomatic status, etc. (Fishers Exact Test p-value<0.05). The most mention-worthy among those were the 3916CtoT (associated with causing sore throat, p-value 0.0005), the 14408C to T (associated with protection from developing cough, p-value= 0.027), and the 28881G to A, 28882G to A, and 28883G to C variant (associated with causing chest pain, p-value 0.025).

ConclusionTo our knowledge, this study is the first large scale phylogenomic studies of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in Bangladesh.

23,A national analysis of trends in COVID-19 infection and clinical management in Veterans Health Administration medical facilities,"OBJECTIVE We explored longitudinal trends in sociodemographic characteristics, reported symptoms, laboratory findings, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, comorbidities, and 30-day in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 43,267 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration between 03/01/20 and 08/31/20 and followed until 09/30/20. We focused our analysis on patients that were subsequently hospitalized, and categorized them into groups based on the month of hospitalization. We summarized our findings through descriptive statistics. We used a nonparametric rank-sum test for trend to examine any differences in the distribution of our study variables across the six months. RESULTS During our study period, 8,240 patients were hospitalized, and 1,081 (13.1%) died within 30 days of admission. Hospitalizations increased over time, but the proportion of patients that died consistently declined from March (N=221/890, 24.8%) to August (N=111/1,396, 8.0%). Patients hospitalized in March compared to August were younger on average, mostly black, and symptomatic. They also had a higher frequency of baseline comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to present with abnormal laboratory findings including low lymphocyte counts and elevated creatinine. Lastly, receipt of mechanical ventilation and Hydroxychloroquine declined from March to August, while treatment with Dexamethasone and Remdesivir increased.

24,SARS-CoV-2 viral load distribution in different patient populations and age groups reveals that viral loads increase with age.,"ObjectivesTo describe the SARS-CoV-2 viral load distribution in different patient groups and age categories.

MethodsAll SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs (first PCR from unique patients only) that were collected between January 1 and December 1, 2020, in the Public Health Services regions Kennemerland and Hollands Noorden, province of Northern Holland, the Netherlands were included in this study. Swabs were derived from patients with respiratory symptoms who were presented at the general practitioner (GP) or hospital, hospital health care workers (HCWs) of four regional hospitals, nursing home residents and HCWs of multiple nursing homes, and in majority (>75%) from Public Health testing facilities of the two Public Health Services. SARS-CoV-2 PCR crossing point (Cp) values were used to estimate viral loads (higher Cp-values indicate lower viral loads).

ResultsIn total, 278.470 unique patients were tested of whom 9.1% (n=25.365) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. As there were differences in viral load distribution between tested populations, further analyses focused on PCRs performed by public health services (n=211.933) where sampling and inclusion were uniform. These data present reveal a clear relation between age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with especially children aged<12 years showing lower viral loads than shown in adults ({beta}: -0.03, 95CI% - 0.03 to -0.02, p<0.001), independent of sex and/or symptom duration. Interestingly, the median Cp values between the oldest (>79 years) and youngest (<12 years) population differed by over 4 PCR cycles, suggesting approximately a 16 fold difference in viral load. In addition, the proportion of children aged < 12 years with a Cp-value >30 was significantly higher compared to the other patients (31.1% vs. 16.9%, p-value<0.001).

ConclusionWe observed that in patients tested by public health services, SARS-CoV2 viral load increases significantly with age. Previous studies suggest that young children (<12 years) play a limited role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Currently, the relation between viral load and infectivity is not yet well understood, and further studies should elucidate whether the lower viral load in children is indeed related to their suggested limited role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, as antigen tests are less sensitive than PCR, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests could have lower sensitivity in children than in adults.",Sjoerd Euser; Sem Aronson; Irene Manders; Steven van Lelyveld; Bjorn Herpers; Ruud Jansen; Sophie Schuurmans Stekhoven; Marlies van Houten; Ivar Lede; James Cohen Stuart; Fred Slijkerman Megelink; Erik Kapteijns; Jeroen den Boer; Elisabeth Sanders; Alex Wagemakers; Dennis Souverein,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249691,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249691,2021-01-17,2021-01-17,,True
25,Insights from a Pan India Sero-Epidemiological survey (Phenome-India Cohort) for SARS-CoV2,"BackgroundIndia has been amongst the most affected nations during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, with sparse data on country-wide spread of asymptomatic infections and antibody persistence. This longitudinal cohort study was aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV2 sero-positivity rate as a marker of infection and evaluate temporal persistence of antibodies with neutralization capability and to infer possible risk factors for infection.

MethodsCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR) with its more than 40 laboratories and centers in urban and semi-urban settings spread across the country piloted the pan country surveillance. 10427 adult individuals working in CSIR laboratories and their family members based on voluntary participation were assessed for antibody presence and stability was analyzed over 6 months utilizing qualitative Elecsys SARS CoV2 specific antibody kit and GENScript cPass SARS-CoV2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit. Along with demographic information, possible risk factors were evaluated through self to be filled online forms with data acquired on blood group type, occupation type, addiction and habits including smoking and alcohol, diet preferences, medical history and transport type utilized. Symptom history and information on possible contact and compliance with COVID 19 universal precautions was also obtained.

Findings1058 individuals (10{middle dot}14%) had antibodies against SARS-CoV2. A follow-up on 346 sero-positive individuals after three months revealed stable to higher antibody levels against SARS-CoV2 but declining plasma activity for neutralizing SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain and ACE2 interaction. A repeat sampling of 35 individuals, at six months, revealed declining antibody levels while the neutralizing activity remained stable compared to three months. Majority of sero-positive individuals (75%) did not recall even one of nine symptoms since March 2020. Fever was the most common symptom with one-fourth reporting loss of taste or smell. Significantly associated risks for sero-positivity (Odds Ratio, 95% CI, p value) were observed with usage of public transport (1{middle dot}79, 1{middle dot}43 - 2{middle dot}24, 2{middle dot}81561E-06), occupational responsibilities such as security, housekeeping personnel etc. (2{middle dot}23, 1{middle dot}92 - 2{middle dot}59, 6{middle dot}43969E-26), non-smokers (1{middle dot}52, 1{middle dot}16 - 1{middle dot}99, 0{middle dot}02) and non-vegetarianism (1{middle dot}67, 1{middle dot}41 - 1{middle dot}99, 3{middle dot}03821E-08). An iterative regression analysis was confirmatory and led to only modest changes to estimates. Predilections for sero-positivity was noted with specific ABO blood groups -O was associated with a lower risk.

InterpretationIn a first-of-its-kind study from India, we report the sero-positivity in a country-wide cohort and identify variable susceptible associations for contacting infection. Serology and Neutralizing Antibody response provides much-sought-for general insights on the immune response to the virus among Indians and will be an important resource for designing vaccination strategies.

26,A Serology Strategy for Epidemiological Studies Based on the Comparison of the Performance of Seven Different Test Systems - The Representative COVID-19 Cohort Munich,"BackgroundSerosurveys are essential to understand SARS-CoV-2 exposure and enable population-level surveillance, but currently available tests need further in-depth evaluation. We aimed to identify testing-strategies by comparing seven seroassays in a population-based cohort.

MethodsWe analysed 6,658 samples consisting of true-positives (n=193), true-negatives (n=1,091), and specimens of unknown status (n=5,374). For primary testing, we used Euroimmun-Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA-IgA/IgG and Roche-Elecsys-Anti-SARS-CoV-2; and virus-neutralisation, GeneScript(R)cPass, VIRAMED-SARS-CoV-2-ViraChip(R), and Mikrogen-recomLine-SARS-CoV-2-IgG, including common-cold CoVs, for confirmatory testing. Statistical modelling generated optimised assay cut-off-thresholds.

FindingsSensitivity of Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgA was 64.8%, specificity 93.3%; for Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgG, sensitivity was 77.2/79.8% (manufacturers/optimised cut-offs), specificity 98.0/97.8%; Roche-anti-N sensitivity was 85.5/88.6%, specificity 99.8/99.7%. In true-positives, mean and median titres remained stable for at least 90-120 days after RT-PCR-positivity. Of true-positives with positive RT-PCR (<30 days), 6.7% did not mount detectable seroresponses. Virus-neutralisation was 73.8% sensitive, 100.0% specific (1:10 dilution). Neutralisation surrogate tests (GeneScript(R)cPass, Mikrogen-recomLine-RBD) were >94.9% sensitive, >98.1% specific. Seasonality had limited effects; cross-reactivity with common-cold CoVs 229E and NL63 in SARS-CoV-2 true-positives was significant.

ConclusionOptimised cut-offs improved test performances of several tests. Non-reactive serology in true-positives was uncommon. For epidemiological purposes, confirmatory testing with virus-neutralisation may be replaced with GeneScript(R)cPass or recomLine-RBD. Head-to-head comparisons given here aim to contribute to the refinement of testing-strategies for individual and public health use.",Laura Olbrich; Noemi Castelletti; Yannik Schaelte; Merce Gari; Peter Puetz; Abhishek Bakuli; Michael Pritsch; Inge Kroidl; Elmar Saathoff; Jessica Michelle Guggenbuehl Noller; Volker Fingerle; Ronan Le Gleut; Leonard Gilberg; Isabel Brand; Philine Falk; Alisa Markgraf; Flora Deak; Friedrich Riess; Max Diefenbach; Tabea M Eser; Franz Weinauer; Silke Martin; Ernst-Markus Quenzel; Marc Becker; Juergen Durner; Philipp Girl; Katharina Mueller; Katja Radon; Christiane Fuchs; Roman Woelfel; Jan Hasenauer; Michael Hoelscher; Andreas Wieser,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249735,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249735,2021-01-16,2021-01-16,,True
27,Metabolic markers distinguish COVID-19 from other intensive care patients and show potential to stratify for disease risk,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection affecting multiple organ systems of great significance for metabolic processes. Thus. there is increasing interest in metabolic and lipoprotein signatures of the disease and early analyses have demonstrated metabolic pattern typical for atherosclerotic and hepatic damage in COVID-19 patients. However, it remains unclear whether these are specific for COVID-19 or a general marker of critical illness. To answer this question, we have analyzed 276 serum samples from 92 individuals using NMR metabolomics, including longitudinally collected samples from 5 COVID-19 and 11 cardiogenic shock intensive care patients, 18 SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals, and 58 healthy controls.

COVID-19 patients showed a distinct metabolic serum profile, including changes typical for severe dyslipidemia and a deeply altered metabolic status compared to healthy controls. Specifically, VLDL parameters, IDL particles, large-sized LDL particles, and the ApoB100/ApoA1 ratio were significantly increased, whereas HDL fractions were decreased. Moreover, a similarly perturbed profile was apparent, even when compared to other ICU patients suffering from cardiogenic shock, highlighting the impact of COVID-19 especially on lipid metabolism and energy status. COVID-19 patients were separated with an AUROC of 1.0 when compared to both healthy controls and cardiogenic shock patients. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals without acute COVID-19 did not show a significantly perturbed metabolic profile compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, but SARS-CoV-2 antibody-titers correlated significantly with metabolic parameters, including levels of glycine, ApoA2, and small-sized LDL and HDL subfractions.

To gauge the effectiveness of these measures at the University of Pennsylvania, we conducted a longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity and seroconversion in patients presenting to infusion centers for cancer-directed therapy between 5/21/2020 and 10/8/2020. Participants completed questionnaires and had up to five serial blood collections. Of 124 enrolled patients, only two (1.6%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on initial blood draw, and no initially seronegative patients developed newly detectable antibodies on subsequent blood draw(s), corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 0% (95%CI 0.0-4.1%) over 14.8 person-years of follow up, with a median of 13 healthcare visits per patient. These results suggest that cancer patients receiving in-person care at a facility with aggressive mitigation efforts have an extremely low likelihood of COVID-19 infection.",Lova Sun; Sanjna Surya; Noah G.; Anh N.

29,Reduction in transfer of micro-organisms between patients and staff using short-sleeved gowns and hand/arm hygiene in Intensive Care during the Covid pandemic: a simulation-based randomised trial.,"BackgroundCurrent PPE practices in UK intensive care units involve ""sessional"" gown use. This protects staff, but puts patients at risk of nosocomial infection via PPE gowns. Anecdotal reports of such infections in ITUs during Covid are frequent. We therefore explored the use of short-sleeved gowns with hand and arm hygiene as an alternative to sessional gowns.

MethodsITU Staff were invited for simulation suite training in Covid intubation and proning. They were trained in a specific hand and arm washing technique before performing simulated tasks using both standard and modified (short sleeved) PPE. Fluorescent powder was used to simulate micro-organisms, and detected using standardised photos under U/V light. Teams of staff were randomised to use standard or modified PPE first. Individuals were questioned about their feeling of personal safety, comfort and the patients safety at 4 intervals.

Results68 staff and 17 proning volunteers were studied in 17 sessions. Modified PPE completely prevented staff contamination during Covid intubation, which occurred in 30/67 staff wearing standard PPE (p = 0.0029, McNemar). Conversely, proning volunteers were contaminated by staff in 15/17 sessions with standard PPE and in 1/17 with modified PPE (P = 0.0227 McNemar). Impressions of staff comfort were superior with modified PPE (p< 0.001, t-test); personal safety scored higher with standard PPE, but the difference decreased during the session (p<0.001 start, 0.068 end). Impressions of patient safety were initially similar (p=0.87) but finished strongly in favour of modified PPE (p<0.001).

ConclusionsModified PPE using short sleeves and hand/arm cleansing appears superior to standard PPE with sessional gowns in preventing transfer of contamination between staff and patients.

30,Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics,"The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk changes across racial and ethnic groups. A proportionate mixing model reduced the overall HIT, but more realistic levels of assortative mixing increased the threshold. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in an assortative mixing model fit to Long Island census data, 80% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT is reached compared to 33% of non-Hispanic whites. Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in a dis-proportionate distribution of the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Kevin C Ma; Tigist Menkir; Stephen Kissler; Yonatan Grad; Marc Lipsitch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249881,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249881,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
31,Development of at-home sample collection logistics for large scale SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies,"In the midst of a pandemic, serologic studies are a valuable tool to understand the course of the outbreak and guide public health and general pandemic management. However, given significant safety constraints including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, sample collection becomes more difficult given traditional phlebotomy protocols. For such studies, a representative sample of the underlying population is paramount to elicit meaningful insights that capture the spread of the infection, particularly when different sub-populations face varying disease burden. We aimed to address these challenges by conducting a fully remote study to investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Massachusetts. Leveraging electronic study engagement and at-home self-collection of finger-prick samples, we enrolled 2,066 participants representative of the ethnic and racial composition of Massachusetts. SARS-CoV-2 total IgG seropositivity was 3.15%, and follow-up measurements at days 7, 15, 45, and 90 indicate a generally durable antibody response. A higher risk of infection was observed for healthcare workers and their cohabitants and those with comorbidities, as well as lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in the age groups of 18-29 and 50-59-years-old. High engagement and positive feedback from the participants and quality of self-collected specimens point to the usefulness of this design for future population-level serological studies that more effectively and safely reach a broad representative cohort, thus yielding more comprehensive insights into the burden of infection and disease in populations.

32,Importance of patient bed pathways and length of stay differences in predicting COVID-19 bed occupancy in England,"ObjectivesPredicting bed occupancy for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requires understanding of length of stay (LoS) in particular bed types. LoS can vary depending on the patients ""bed pathway"" - the sequence of transfers between bed types during a hospital stay. In this study, we characterise these pathways, and their impact on predicted hospital bed occupancy.

DesignWe obtained data from University College Hospital (UCH) and the ISARIC4C COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who required care in general ward or critical care (CC) beds to determine possible bed pathways and LoS. We developed a discrete-time model to examine the implications of using either bed pathways or only average LoS by bed type to forecast bed occupancy. We compared model-predicted bed occupancy to publicly available bed occupancy data on COVID-19 in England between March and August 2020.

ResultsIn both the UCH and CO-CIN datasets, 82% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 only received care in general ward beds. We identified four other bed pathways, present in both datasets: ""Ward, CC, Ward"", ""Ward, CC"", ""CC"" and ""CC, Ward"". Mean LoS varied by bed type, pathway, and dataset, between 1.78 and 13.53 days.

For UCH, we found that using bed pathways improved the accuracy of bed occupancy predictions, while only using an average LoS for each bed type underestimated true bed occupancy. However, using the CO-CIN LoS dataset we were not able to replicate past data on bed occupancy in England, suggesting regional LoS heterogeneities.

ConclusionsWe identified five bed pathways, with substantial variation in LoS by bed type, pathway, and geography. This might be caused by local differences in patient characteristics, clinical care strategies, or resource availability, and suggests that national LoS averages may not be appropriate for local forecasts of bed occupancy for COVID-19.",Quentin J Leclerc; Naomi M Fuller; Ruth H Keogh; Karla Diaz-Ordaz; Richard Sekula; Malcolm G Semple; - ISARIC4C Investigators; - CMMID COVID-19 Working Group; Katherine E Atkins; Simon R Procter; Gwenan M Knight,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249791,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249791,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
33,"Do antibody positive healthcare workers have lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates than antibody negative healthcare workers? Large multi-centre prospective cohort study (the SIREN study), England: June to November 2020","BackgroundThere is an urgent need to better understand whether individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 are protected from future SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsA large multi-centre prospective cohort was recruited from publicly funded hospital staff in the UK. Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed fortnightly questionnaires on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive or prior PCR/antibody test positive) or negative cohort (antibody negative, not previously known to be PCR/antibody positive). Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, possible (subdivided by symptom-status)) depending on hierarchy of evidence. Individuals in the primary infection were excluded from this analysis if infection was confirmed by antibody only. Reinfection rates in the positive cohort were compared against new PCR positives in the negative cohort using a mixed effective multivariable logistic regression analysis.

FindingsBetween 18 June and 09 November 2020, 44 reinfections (2 probable, 42 possible) were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 6,614 participants, collectively contributing 1,339,078 days of follow-up. This compares with 318 new PCR positive infections and 94 antibody seroconversions in the negative cohort of 14,173 participants, contributing 1,868,646 days of follow-up. The incidence density per 100,000 person days between June and November 2020 was 3.3 reinfections in the positive cohort, compared with 22.4 new PCR confirmed infections in the negative cohort. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.17 for all reinfections (95% CI 0.13-0.24) compared to PCR confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was over 160 days.

InterpretationA prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 83% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed five months following primary infection. This is the minimum likely effect as seroconversions were not included.

36,"Modelling the Spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 in Presence of the Lockdown and Quarantine Measures by a ""Kinetic-Type Reactions"" Approach","We propose a realistic model for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures, which takes into account the time-delay for recovery or death processes. The dynamic equations for the entire process are derived by adopting a kinetic-type reactions approach. More specifically, the lockdown and the quarantine measures are modelled by some kind of inhibitor reactions where susceptible and infected individuals can be trapped into inactive states. The dynamics for the recovered people is obtained by accounting people who are only traced back to hospitalised infected people. To get the evolution equation we take inspiration from the Michaelis-Mentens enzyme-substrate reaction model (the so-called MM reaction) where the enzyme is associated to the available hospital beds, the substrate to the infected people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively. In other words, everything happens as if the hospitals beds act as a catalyzer in the hospital recovery process. Of course, in our case the reverse MM reactions has no sense in our case and, consequently, the kinetic constant is equal to zero. Finally, the O.D.E.s for people tested positive to COVID-19 is simply modelled by the following kinetic scheme S + I {Rightarrow} 2I with I {Rightarrow} R or I {Rightarrow} D, with S, I, R, and D denoting the compartments Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased people, respectively. The resulting kinetic-type equations provide the O.D.E.s, for elementary reaction steps, describing the number of the infected people, the total number of the recovered people previously hospitalised, subject to the lockdown and the quarantine measure, and the total number of deaths. The model foresees also the second wave of Infection by Coronavirus.

37,Optimal piecewise constant vaccination and lockdown policies for COVID-19,"We formulate a controlled system of ordinary differential equations, with vaccination and lockdown interventions as controls, to simulate the mitigation of COVID-19. The performance of the controls is measured through a cost functional involving vaccination and lockdown costs as well as the burden of COVID19 quantified in DALYs. We calibrate parameters with data from Mexico City and Valle de Mexico. By using differential evolution, we minimize the cost functional subject to the controlled system and find optimal policies that are constant in time intervals of a given size. The main advantage of these policies relies on its practical implementation since the health authority has to make only a finite number of different decisions. Our methodology to find optimal policies is relatively general, allowing changes in the dynamics, the cost functional, or the frequency the policymaker changes actions.",Gabriel Adrian Salcedo-Varea; Francisco Penunuri; David Gonzalez-Sanchez; Saul Diaz-Infante,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249773,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249773,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
38,Optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation using real-time seroprevalence estimates in Rhode Island and Massachusetts,"As three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines come to market in Europe and North America in the winter of 2020-2021, distribution networks will be in a race against a major epidemiological wave of SARS-CoV-2 that began in autumn 2020. Rapid and optimized vaccine allocation is critical during this time. With 95% efficacy reported for two of the vaccines, near-term public health needs require that distribution is prioritized to the elderly, health-care workers, teachers, essential workers, and individuals with co-morbidities putting them at risk of severe clinical progression. Here, we evaluate various age-based vaccine distributions using a validated mathematical model based on current epidemic trends in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. We allow for varying waning efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity, as this has not yet been measured. We account for the fact that known COVID-positive cases may not be included in the first round of vaccination. And, we account for current age-specific immune patterns in both states. We find that allocating a substantial proportion (> 75%) of vaccine supply to individuals over the age of 70 is optimal in terms of reducing total cumulative deaths through mid-2021. As we do not explicitly model other high mortality groups, this result on vaccine allocation applies to all groups at high risk of mortality if infected. Our analysis confirms that for an easily transmissible respiratory virus, allocating a large majority of vaccinations to groups with the highest mortality risk is optimal. Our analysis assumes that health systems during winter 2020-2021 have equal staffing and capacity to previous phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; we do not consider the effects of understaffed hospitals or unvaccinated medical staff. Vaccinating only seronegative individuals avoids redundancy in vaccine use on individuals that may already be immune, and will result in 1% to 2% reductions in cumulative hospitalizations and deaths by mid-2021. Assuming high vaccination coverage (> 28%) and no major relaxations in distancing, masking, gathering size, or hygiene guidelines between now and spring 2021, our model predicts that a combination of vaccination and population immunity will lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021.",Thu Nguyen-Anh Tran; Nathan Wikle; Joseph Albert; Haider Inam; Emily R Strong; Karel Brinda; Scott M Leighow; Fuhan Yang; Sajid Hossain; Justin R Pritchard; Philip Chan; William P Hanage; Ephraim M Hanks; Maciej F Boni,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249694,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249694,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
39,"Socioeconomic status determines COVID-19 incidence and related mortality in Santiago, Chile","The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted dense urban populations particularly hard. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality patterns, and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. We find that among all age groups, there is a strong association between socioeconomic status and both mortality -measured either by direct COVID-19 attributed deaths or excess deaths- and public health capacity. Specifically, we show that behavioral factors like human mobility, as well as health system factors such as testing volumes, testing delays, and test positivity rates are associated with disease outcomes. These robust patterns suggest multiple possibly interacting pathways that can explain the observed disease burden and mortality differentials: (i) in lower socioeconomic status municipalities, human mobility was not reduced as much as in more affluent municipalities; (ii) testing volumes in these locations were insufficient early in the pandemic and public health interventions were applied too late to be effective; (iii) test positivity and testing delays were much higher in less affluent municipalities, indicating an impaired capacity of the health-care system to contain the spread of the epidemic; and (iv) infection fatality rates appear much higher in the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum.

40,Predicting Emerging Themes in Rapidly Expanding COVID-19 Literature with Dynamic Word Embedding Networks and Machine Learning,"BackgroundCOVID-19 knowledge has been changing rapidly with the fast pace of information that accompanied the pandemic. Since peer-reviewed research is a trusted source of evidence, capturing and predicting the emerging themes in COVID-19 literature are crucial for guiding research and policy. Machine learning, natural language processing and dynamical networks have the potential to enable rapid distillation and prediction of actionable insights for ending the pandemic.

ObjectiveWe hypothesized that emerging COVID-19 research trends can be captured and predicted from networks constructed upon language features. Further, we aimed to detect communities in these networks and used centrality measures to track and predict emerging network modules as dominant themes in a given time period. The goal of our study was to make our findings publicly available as an explainable AI dashboard for researchers and policymakers.

MethodsAbstracts from more than 95,000 peer-reviewed articles from the WHO curated COVID-19 database were used to construct word embedding models. Named entity recognition was used to refine the terms. Cosine similarity between the terms was then used to construct dynamical networks in order to understand the temporal trend of emerging associations over months and visualized as alluvial diagrams. Finally, temporal link prediction between diseases for the subsequent month based on their trends of occurrence in the previous six months was carried out to predict the emergence and disappearance of associations in the rapidly changing pandemic scenario.

ResultsCommunity detection upon dynamical networks clearly demonstrated the emergence of thromboembolic complications as a cluster and dominant theme between March and August, 2020. Forecasting of top-K influential entities further allowed prediction of future trends, such as the emergence of psychiatry theme as a central node by February 2021. XGBoost modeling in our proposed temporal link prediction framework achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.855 for predicting new dis(associations) one month in advance. Visualization of the underlying word-embedding models allowed interactive querying to choose novel keywords and extractive models summarized the research relevant to the keyword, allowing faster knowledge distillation.

ConclusionWe provide an explainable AI approach for querying, tracking and predicting novel insights in COVID-19 peer reviewed literature.

The second objective was to explore the acceptability of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA prospective pre-post study was conducted with first time mothers in Nova Scotia, Canada between July 15th and September 19th, 2020. Participants completed a self-report survey at enrolment (after birth) and six-weeks postpartum. Variety of standardized measures were used and qualitative feedback on the program was also collected. Paired t-tests were carried out to determine changes from baseline to follow-up on psychosocial outcomes and qualitative feedback was analysed through thematic analysis.

ResultsA total of 88 women enrolled. Self-efficacy increased between baseline (B) and follow-up (F) (B:33.33; F:37.11, p=0.000) while anxiety (STAI) declined (B:38.49; F:34.79; p=0.004).

43,Sterilization of disposable face masks with respect to COVID-19 shortages; a nationwide field study including 19 sterilisation departments,"ObjectiveFace masks also referred to as half masks are essential to protect healthcare professionals, working in close contact with patients having Covid-19 related symptoms. During the threating deficit, healthcare institutions sought an approach to re-use face masks or to acquire imported masks. The objective of this study is to assess the quality of sterilised and imported FFP2/KN95 face mask materials.

Designprospective, bench-to-bedside

SettingGeneral healthcare including 19 hospitals in the Netherlands

InterventionsFace masks were reprocessed using a medical autoclave at 121{degrees}C.

MethodsA 48 minutes steam sterilization process of single-use face masks with 15 min holding time at a 121 {degrees}C was developed, validated and implemented in 19 different hospitals. Steam and H2O2 plasma sterilized as well as new, imported masks are tested in a custom-made, non-standard EN-149, test set-up that measures Particle Filtration Efficiency (PFE) and pressure drops.

ResultsPFE validation data of 84 masks indicated differences of 2.3{+/-}2 % (mean{+/-}SD) between the custom build test set-up and a continues flow according to the EN-149. Test data showed the mean PFE values of 444 sterilised FFP2 face masks from 19 CSSD were 90{+/-}11% (mean{+/-}SD) and of 474 imported KN95/FFP2 face masks 83{+/-}16% (mean{+/-}SD). Differences in PFE between sterilisation departments were found.

ConclusionFace masks can be reprocessed with 121 0 C steam or H2O2 plasma sterilization with minimum reduction of PFE. PFE comparison between sterilised mask and new, imported mask filter material indicates that most reprocessed masks of high quality brands outperform new imported face masks of unknown brands. Although the PFE of tested face mask material from different sterilisation departments remained efficient, different types of sterilisation equipment can result in different PFE outcomes.

44,SARS-CoV-2 infection control implementation based on sources of infection showing directions for three age groups in Japan,"BackgroundSome aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission in children and adults remain unclear. This report describes different SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns by age group in Japan.

Methods and findingsThis retrospective observational case series study analyzed transmission patterns of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections found by local health authorities and commercial laboratories during January 14 through July 31, 2020 in Japan. After ascertaining the infection source for every symptomatic case as clusters at households, daycare facilities, schools, hospitals and workplaces etc., their associated transmission patterns were analyzed. Identified cases were divided into three groups: underage, < 20; adults, 20-59; and elderly people 60 years old and older. The reproductive number (R)s of respective transmission directions found for the respective age groups were compared.

Of 26,986 total cases, 23,746 unknown cases were found, leaving 3,240 ascertained sources of infection (12.0%) comprising 125 (3.9%) underage, 2350 (72.5%) adult, and 765 (23.6%) elderly people. The respective Rs of underage infection sources directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0415 (95% CI, 0.0138-0.0691), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.9171-1.3226), and 0.2811 (95% CI, 0.2074-0.3687). The respective Rs of adult infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0140 (95% CI, 0.0120-0.0162), 0.5392 (95% CI, 0.5236-0.5550), and 0.1135 (95% CI, 0.1074-0.1197). The respective Rs of elderly infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated as 0.065 (95% CI, 0.0039-0.0091), 0.3264 (95% CI, 0.3059-0.3474), and 0.3991 (95% CI, 0.3757-0.4229).

ConclusionsThe main sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection were adults and elderly people. The R of underage people directed to adults was greater than 1 because of close familial contact but they were unlikely to become carriers transmitting SARS-CoV-2 because they accounted for a minority for transmissions. Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among adults and elderly people, suggesting that infection control of SARS-CoV-2 should be managed specifically by generation.",Atsuko Hata; Junko Kurita; Eri Muso; Toshiro Katayama; Takahide Hata; Yasushi Ohkusa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249637,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249637,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
45,How to best test suspected cases of COVID-19: an analysis of the diagnostic performance of RT-PCR and alternative molecular methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,"As COVID-19 testing is rolled out increasingly widely, the use of a range of alternative testing methods will be beneficial in ensuring testing systems are resilient and adaptable to different clinical and public health scenarios. Here, we compare and discuss the diagnostic performance of a range of different molecular assays designed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with suspected COVID-19. Using findings from a systematic review of 103 studies, we categorised COVID-19 molecular assays into 12 different test classes, covering point-of-care tests, various alternative RT-PCR protocols, and alternative methods such as isothermal amplification. We carried out meta-analyses to estimate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of each test class. We also estimated the positive and negative predictive values of all diagnostic test classes across a range of prevalence rates. Using previously validated RT-PCR assays as a reference standard, 11 out of 12 classes showed a summary sensitivity estimate of at least 92% and a specificity estimate of at least 99%. Several diagnostic test classes were estimated to have positive predictive values of 100% throughout the investigated prevalence spectrum, whilst estimated negative predictive values were more variable and sensitive to disease prevalence. We also report the results of clinical utility models that can be used to determine the information gained from a positive and negative test result in each class, and whether each test is more suitable for confirmation or exclusion of disease. Our analysis suggests that several tests exist that are suitable alternatives to standard RT-PCR and we discuss scenarios in which these could be most beneficial, such as where time to test result is critical or, where resources are constrained. However, we also highlight methodological concerns with the design and conduct of many included studies, and also the existence of likely publication bias for some test classes. Our results should be interpreted with these shortcomings in mind. Furthermore, our conclusions on test performance are limited to their use in symptomatic populations: we did not identify sufficient suitable data to allow analysis of testing in asymptomatic populations.",Adrian Mironas; David Jarrom; Evan Campbell; Jennifer Washington; Sabine Ettinger; Ingrid Wilbacher; Gottfried Endel; Hrvoje Vrazic; Susan Myles; Matthew Prettyjohns,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249863,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249863,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
46,Antibiotic Prescribing Patterns at COVID-19 Dedicated Wards in Bangladesh: A Single Center Point-Prevalence Survey,"There is a clear deficiency in antimicrobial usage data and ongoing stewardship programs both in government and private health care facilities in Bangladesh. As evidences are mounting regarding irrational and often unnecessary use of antibiotics during COVID-19 pandemic, a point prevalence survey (PPS) was conducted across COVID-19 dedicated wards in Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). Antibiotic usage data were collected from 193 patients at different COVID-19 dedicated wards at DMCH between 21 May, 2020 and 10 June, 2020. Comparisons in antibiotic usage were made between different groups using Pearson chi-square and Fisher exact test. Factors associated with multiple antibiotic prescription were evaluated using binary logistic regression model.

On survey date all (100%) patients were receiving at least one antibiotic with 133 patients (68.91%) receiving multiple antibiotics. Overall, patients presenting with severe disease received more antibiotics on average. Third generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone (53.8%), meropenem (40.9%), moxifloxacin (29.5%) and doxycycline (25.4%) were the four most prescribed antibiotics among survey patients. Among comorbidities diabetes mellitus (DM) was independently associated with increased antibiotic prescribing. Abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum d-dimer were linked with higher odds of antibiotic prescribing among survey patients. Overall, prevalence of antibiotic prescribing in COVID-19 patients at DMCH was very high. This could be attributed to a lack of clear treatment protocol against COVID-19 till date as well as lack of modern laboratory facilities to support judicial antibiotic prescribing in Bangladesh. A well-functioning antibiotic stewardship program in Bangladesh is required to prevent an impending health crisis.",Md. Maruf Ahmed Molla; Mahmuda Yeasmin; Md. Khairul Islam; Md.

We report that neutrophils, T regulatory cells (Tregs), and monocytes from patients with severe Covid-19 express FV, and expression correlates with T cell lymphopenia. In vitro full length FV, but not FV activated by thrombin cleavage, suppresses T cell proliferation. Increased and prolonged FV expression by cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems may contribute to lymphopenia in severe Covid-19. Activation by thrombin destroys the immunosuppressive properties of FV.

48,"Anticipating the curve: can online symptom-based data reflect COVID-19 case activity in Ontario, Canada?","BackgroundLimitations in laboratory diagnostic capacity and reporting delays have hampered efforts to mitigate and control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic globally. Syndromic surveillance of COVID-19 is an important public health tool that can help detect outbreaks, mobilize a rapid response, and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether syndromic surveillance through self-reported COVID-19 symptoms could be a timely proxy for laboratory-confirmed case trends in the Canadian province of Ontario.

MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed self-reported symptoms data collected using an online tool - Outbreaks Near Me (ONM) - from April 20th to Oct 11th, 2020 in Ontario, Canada. We estimated the correlation coefficient between the weekly proportion of respondents reporting a COVID-like illness (CLI) to both the weekly number of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and the percent positivity in the same period for the same week and with a one-week lag.

ResultsThere were 314,686 responses from 188,783 unique respondents to the ONM symptom survey. Respondents were more likely to be female and be in the 40-59 age demographic compared to the Ontario general population. There was a strong positive correlation between the weekly number of reported cases in Ontario and the percent of respondents reporting CLI each week (r = 0.89, p <0.01) and with a one-week lag (r = 0.89, p <0.01).

InterpretationWe demonstrate a strong positive and significant correlation (r = 0.89, p <0.01) between percent of self-reported COVID-like illness and the subsequent weeks COVID-19 cases reported, highlighting that a rise in CLI may precede official statistics by at least 1 week. This demonstrates the utility of syndromic surveillance in predicting near-future disease activity. Digital surveillance systems are low-cost tools that may help measure the burden of COVID-19 in a community if there is under-detection of cases through conventional laboratory diagnostic testing.

49,A Vital Sign-based Prediction Algorithm for Differentiating COVID-19 Versus Seasonal Influenza in Hospitalized Patients,"Patients with influenza and SARS-CoV2/Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections have different clinical course and outcomes. We developed and validated a supervised machine learning pipeline to distinguish the two viral infections using the available vital signs and demographic dataset from the first hospital/emergency room encounters of 3,883 patients who had confirmed diagnoses of influenza A/B, COVID-19 or negative laboratory test results. The models were able to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of at least 97% using our multiclass classifier. The predictive models were externally validated on 15,697 encounters in 3,125 patients available on TrinetX database that contains patient-level data from different healthcare organizations. The influenza vs. COVID-19-positive model had an AUC of 98%, and 92% on the internal and external test sets, respectively. Our study illustrates the potentials of machine-learning models for accurately distinguishing the two viral infections.

50,Innate lymphoid cells and disease tolerance in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BACKGROUNDRisk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases with age, is greater in males, and is associated with decreased numbers of blood lymphoid cells. Though the reasons for these robust associations are unclear, effects of age and sex on innate and adaptive lymphoid subsets, including on homeostatic innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) implicated in disease tolerance, may underlie the effects of age and sex on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

METHODSFlow cytometry was used to quantitate subsets of blood lymphoid cells from people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), comparing those hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (n=40) and those treated as outpatients for less severe disease (n=51). 86 healthy individuals served as controls. The relationship between abundance of specific blood lymphoid cell types, age, sex, hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, and elevation of blood markers for systemic inflammation, was determined using multiple regression.

RESULTSAfter accounting for effects of age and sex, hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with 1.78-fold fewer ILCs (95%CI: 2.34-1.36; p = 4.55 x 10-5) and 2.31-fold fewer CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells (95%CI: 3.1-1.71; p = 1.04 x 10-7), when compared to uninfected controls. Among people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the odds ratio for hospitalization, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of symptoms, was 0.413 (95%CI: 0.197-0.724; p = 0.00691) for every 2-fold increase in ILCs. In addition, higher ILC abundance was associated with less time spent in the hospital and lower levels of blood markers associated with COVID-19 severity: each two-fold increase in ILC abundance was associated with a 9.38 day decrease in duration of hospital stay (95% CI: 15.76-3.01; p= 0.0054), and decrease in blood C-reactive protein (CRP) by 46.29 mg/L (95% CI: 71.34-21.24; p = 6.25 x 10-4), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) by 11.04 mm/h (95% CI: 21.94-0.13; p = 0.047), and the fibrin degradation product D-dimer by 1098.52 ng/mL (95% CI: 1932.84-264.19; p = 0.011).

CONCLUSIONSBoth ILCs and NK cells were depleted in the blood of people hospitalized for severe COVID-19, but, among lymphoid cell subsets, only ILC abundance was independently associated with the need for hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, and severity of inflammation. These results indicate that, by promoting disease tolerance, homeostatic ILCs protect against morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest that reduction in the number of ILCs with age and in males accounts for the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in these demographic groups.",Noah J.

51,Detection of SARS-Cov-2 RNA in serum is associated with increased mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has overloaded national health services worldwide. Thus, early identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes is critical. Our objective was to analyse SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum as a severity biomarker in COVID-19.

Methods and FindingsRetrospective observational study including 193 patients admitted for COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (CoVemia) was performed with samples collected at 48-72 hours of admission by two techniques from Roche and Thermo Fischer Scientific (TFS). Main outcome variables were mortality and need for ICU admission during hospitalization for COVID-19.

CoVemia was detected in 50-60% of patients depending on technique. The correlation of Ct in serum between both techniques was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.612; p < 0.001). Patients with CoVemia were older (p = 0.006), had poorer baseline oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2; p < 0.001), more severe lymphopenia (p < 0.001) and higher LDH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p = 0.021), C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.022) and procalcitonin (p = 0.002) serum levels.

We defined ""relevant CoVemia"" when detection Ct was < 34 with Roche and < 31 for TFS. These thresholds had 95% sensitivity and 35 % specificity. Relevant CoVemia predicted death during hospitalization (OR 9.2 [3.8 - 22.6] for Roche, OR 10.3 [3.6 - 29.3] for TFS; p < 0.001). Cox regression models, adjusted by age, sex and Charlson index, identified increased LDH serum levels and relevant CoVemia (HR = 9.87 [4.13-23.57] for TFS viremia and HR = 7.09 [3.3-14.82] for Roche viremia) as the best markers to predict mortality.

ConclusionsCoVemia assessment at admission is the most useful biomarker for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. CoVemia is highly reproducible with two different techniques (TFS and Roche), has a good consistency with other severity biomarkers for COVID-19 and better predictive accuracy.

AUTHOR SUMMARYCOVID-19 shows a very heterogeneous clinical picture. In addition, it has overloaded national health services worldwide. Therefore, early identification of patients with poor prognosis is critical to improve the use of limited health resources. In this work, we evaluated whether baseline SARS-CoV2 RNA detection in blood (CoVemia) is associated with worse outcomes. We studied almost 200 patients admitted to our hospital and about 50-60% of them showed positive CoVemia. Patients with positive CoVemia were older and had more severe disease; CoVemia was also more frequent in patients requiring admission to the ICU. Moreover, we defined ""relevant CoVemia"", as the amount of viral load that better predicted mortality obtaining 95% sensitivity and 35% specificity. In addition, relevant CoVemia was a better predictor than other biomarkers such as LDH, lymphocyte count, interleukin-6, and indexes used in ICU such as qSOFA and CURB65.

In summary, detection of CoVemia is the best biomarker to predict death in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, it is easy to be implemented and is reproducible with two techniques (Roche and Thermo Fisher Scientific) that are currently used for diagnosis in nasopharyngeal swabs samples.",Diego A.

52,The impact of high dose oral cotrimoxazole in patients with COVID-19 with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation: A Case Control Study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 can be fatal in a significant proportion of people who develop critical illness, resulting in hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which is thought to be mediated by a cytokine storm syndrome. Steroids have been shown to be of some benefit, but the mainstay of treatment remains supportive.

MethodsThe data was collected retrospectively from consecutive, newly diagnosed patients presenting to the critical care facility of I Q City Medical College Hospital, Durgapur, India between June and November 2020 with critical COVID-19 on non-invasive ventilation treated with high dose oral cotrimoxazole (CTX) in addition to standard therapy (ST) and compared with patients with critical COVID-19 receiving standard therapy alone.

Results201 patients were identified. Of which 151 patients received CTX in addition to ST (mean age {+/-} SD 59 {+/-} 13 years, 81% male and mean BMI {+/-} SD 28 {+/-} 2) and 50 patients received ST alone (mean age {+/-} SD 63 {+/-} 12, 64% male and mean BMI {+/-} SD 27 {+/-} 2). We observed that the patients with critical COVID-19 receiving CTX in addition to ST had significantly better outcomes including reduced in-patient mortality (13% versus 40%, p <0.001), length of hospital and critical care unit stay (mean, 11 versus 15 days (p <0.001) and 6 versus 11 days (p <0.001) respectively), and the need for mechanical ventilation (16% versus 42%, p <0.001) with improved CRP at day 7 (mean, 38mg/L versus 62mg/L, p = 0.001).

53,Optimising SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing strategies on social networks for low-resource settings,"Controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global challenge. The rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 directly reflects the social structure. Before effective vaccines and treatments are widely available, we have to rely on alternative, non-pharmaceutical interventions, including frequency testing, contact tracing, social distancing, mask wearing, and hand-washing, as public health practises to slow down the spread of the disease. However frequent testing is the key in the absence of any alternative. We propose a network approach to determine the optimal low resources setting oriented pool testing strategies that identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing, at low prevalence of the virus. We simulate stochastic infection curves on societies under quarantine. Allowing some social interaction is possible to keep the COVID-19 curve flat. However, similar results can be strategically obtained searching and isolating infected persons to preserve a healthier social structure. Here, we analyze which are the best strategies to contain the virus applying an algorithm that combine samples and testing them in groups [1]. A relevant parameter to keep infection curves flat using this algorithm is the dairy frequency of testing at zones where a high infection rate is reported. On the other hand, the algorithm efficiency is low for random search of infected people.",Karina I Mazzitello; Yi Jiang; Constancio Miguel Arizmendi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.20249064,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.20249064,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

55,Persistently increased systemic ACE2 activity and Furin levels are associated with increased inflammatory response in smokers with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19,"BackgroundTobacco smoking is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of several cardiopulmonary diseases, and smokers are susceptible to infectious agents. However, the progression of lung injury based on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity amongst smokers and those with pre-existing pulmonary diseases is not known. We determined the systemic expression and activity of COVID-19 related proteins, cytokine/chemokines, and lipid mediators (lipidomics) amongst COVID-19 patients with and without a history of smoking with a view to define biomarkers.

MethodsWe obtained serum from COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 recovered patients with and without a history of smoking. We conducted a Luminex multiplex assay (cytokine levels), LC/MS (eicosanoids or oxylipin panel) and enzymatic activity assays on the serum samples to study the systemic changes in COVID-19 patients.

ResultsOn comparing the cytokine profiles among COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients, we found a significant upregulation in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-8, IL-2, VEGF and IL-10 in COVID-19 positive patients as compared to the respective controls. Interestingly, smoking history resulted in further augmentation of the release of some hyper-inflammatory cytokines, like IFN-{gamma}, Eotaxin, MCP-1 and IL-9 amongst COVID-19 positive patients. The enzymatic activity for ACE2, the binding partner for SARS-CoV2 virus in the host cell, was found to be significantly increased in the serum of patients with a smoking history compared to the serum collected from the non-smoking controls. Similarly to our cytokine analysis, our measurement of serum Furin levels was also affected by the patients smoking history, in which we reported a substantial rise in serum Furin levels of COVID-19 patients. The analysis of lipid mediators revealed a distinct signature amongst the COVID-19 positive versus recovered subjects in PGF2, HETEs, LXA4 and LTB4 levels. However, we did not find any changes in the levels of any lipid mediators based on the smoking history of the patients. Overall, our results point towards distinct systemic signatures amongst COVID-19 positive patients. We also show that smoking adversely affects the systemic levels of inflammatory markers and COVID-19 related proteins, thus suggesting that COVID-19 infection may have severe outcomes amongst smokers which is reflected systemically.",Gagandeep Kaur; Shaiesh Yogeswaran; Thivanka Muthumalage; Irfan Rahman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249836,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249836,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

Outcome measuresRates of hospital readmission, all-cause mortality, and diagnoses of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney and liver diseases until 30 September 2020.

ResultsMean follow-up time was 140 days for COVID-19 cases and 153 days for controls. 766 (95% confidence interval: 753 to 779) readmissions and 320 (312 to 328) deaths per 1,000 person-years were observed in COVID-19 cases, 3.5 (3.4 to 3.6) and 7.7 (7.2 to 8.3) times greater, respectively, than in controls. Rates of respiratory, diabetes and cardiovascular events were also significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases, at 770 (758 to 783), 127 (122 to 132) and 126 (121 to 131) events per 1,000 person-years, respectively. RRs were greater for individuals aged <70 than [&ge;] 70 years, and in ethnic minority groups than the White population, with the biggest differences observed for respiratory disease: 10.5 [9.7 to 11.4] for <70 years versus 4.6 [4.3 to 4.8] for [&ge;] 70 years, and 11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for Non-White versus 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) for White.

ConclusionsIndividuals discharged from hospital following COVID-19 face elevated rates of multi-organ dysfunction compared with background levels, and the increase in risk is neither confined to the elderly nor uniform across ethnicities. The diagnosis, treatment and prevention of PCS require integrated rather than organ- or disease-specific approaches.

57,An Estimation of Reproduction Number of SARS-CoV-2 by Age Class for Age Classes in Japan,"BackgroundInfectiousness of COVID-19 by age class inferred from the infection source and by infected people might be different. However, studies of such infectiousness have not been reported.

ObjectThe object of this study was estimation of reproduction numbers by age class of the source of infection and the infected persons. To do so, after examining a new procedure for reproduction number estimation, we checked infected places by age class of the source of infection and the infected persons.

MethodWe ignore patients who infected no one because their reliability might be lower than that of patients who infected more than one person. We estimated the reproduction number from the histogram of the number of the infected people by the same patient, assuming that the histogram follows an exponential distribution.

Discussion and ConclusionThe obtained results demonstrated that the effective reproduction numbers for infection from children were very low. They were higher among adult and elderly people than among the same age class. Moreover, although the highest and second-highest infected places were  other and  at home with some exceptions, the data for infection at hospitals were remarkable among adults and elderly people. Among elderly people, infection at facilities for elderly was also high. Infections at nursing schools, schools, restaurants, and entertainment venues at night were negligible.",Junko Kurita; Takahide Hata; Tamie Sugawara; Yasushi Ohkusa; Atsuko Hata,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249854,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249854,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
58,In vivo structure and dynamics of the RNA genome of SARS-Cov-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 pandemic, is one of the largest positive strand RNA viruses. Here we developed a simplified SPLASH assay and comprehensively mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the viral life cycle. We observed canonical and alternative structures including 3'-UTR and 5'-UTR, frameshifting element (FSE) pseudoknot and genome cyclization in cells and in virions. We provided direct evidence of interactions between Transcription Regulating Sequences (TRS-L and TRS-Bs), which facilitate discontinuous transcription. In addition, we revealed alternative short and long distance arches around FSE, forming a ""high-order pseudoknot"" embedding FSE, which might help ribosome stalling at frameshift sites. More importantly, we found that within virions, during SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA undergoing intensive compaction, genome cyclization is weakened and genome domains remain stable. Our data provides a structural basis for the regulation of replication, discontinuous transcription and translational frameshifting, describes dynamics of RNA structures during life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and will help to develop antiviral strategies.",Yan Zhang; Kun Huang; Dejian Xie; Jian You Lau; Wenlong Shen; Ping Li; Dong Wang; Zhong Zou; Shu Shi; Hongguang Ren; Meilin Jin; Grzegorz Kudla; Zhihu Zhao,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426526,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426526,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,False
59,Structural characterization of cocktail-like targeting polysaccharides from Ecklonia kurome Okam and their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in vitro,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent responsible for the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Investigation has confirmed that polysaccharide heparan sulfate can bind to the spike protein and block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Theoretically, similar structure of nature polysaccharides may also have the impact on the virus. Indeed, some marine polysaccharide has been reported to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 infection in vitro, however the convinced targets and mechanism are still vague. By high throughput screening to target 3CLpro enzyme, a key enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the viral replication and transcription using nature polysaccharides library, we discover the mixture polysaccharide 375 from seaweed Ecklonia kurome Okam completely block 3Clpro enzymatic activity (IC50, 0.48 {micro}M). Further, the homogeneous polysaccharide 37502 from the 375 may bind to 3CLpro molecule well (kD value : 4.23 x 10-6). Very interestingly, 37502 also can potently disturb spike protein binding to ACE2 receptor (EC50, 2.01 {micro}M). Importantly, polysaccharide 375 shows good anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in cell culture with EC50 values of 27 nM (99.9% inhibiting rate at the concentration of 20 {micro}g/mL), low toxicity (LD50: 136 mg/Kg on mice). By DEAE ion-exchange chromatography, 37501, 37502 and 37503 polysaccharides are purified from native 375. Bioactivity test show that 37501 and 37503 may impede SARS-Cov-2 infection and virus replication, however their individual impact on the virus is significantly less that of 375. Surprisingly, polysaccharide 37502 has no inhibition effect on SARS-Cov-2. The structure study based on monosaccharide composition, methylation, NMR spectrum analysis suggest that 375 contains guluronic acid, mannuronic acid, mannose, rhamnose, glucouronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose and fucose with ratio of 1.86 : 9.56 : 6.81 : 1.69 : 1.00 : 1.75 : 1.19 : 11.06 : 4.31 : 23.06. However, polysaccharide 37502 is an aginate which composed of mannuronic acid (89.3 %) and guluronic acid (10.7 %), with the molecular weight (Mw) of 27.9 kDa. These results imply that mixture polysaccharides 375 works better than the individual polysaccharide on SARS-Cov-2 may be the cocktail-like polysaccharide synergistic function through targeting multiple key molecules implicated in the virus infection and replication. The results also suggest that 375 may be a potential drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2.",Kan Ding; Bo Zhang; Xinwen Chen; Yechun Xu; Chunfan Huang; Can Jin; Zhenyun Du; Xia Chen; Yaqi Ding; Hao Sun; Meixia Li; Rongjuan Pei; Shihai Zhang; Minbo Su; Yi Zhang; Jia Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426521,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426521,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,False
60,Enhanced Cholesterol-dependent Hemifusion by Internal Fusion Peptide 1 of SARS Coronavirus-2 Compared to its N-terminal Counterpart,"Membrane fusion is an important step for the entry of the lipid-sheathed viruses into the host cells. The fusion process is being carried out by fusion proteins present in the viral envelope. The class I viruses contains a 20-25 amino acid sequence at its N-terminal of the fusion domain, which is instrumental in fusion, and is termed as  fusion peptide. However, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS) coronaviruses contain more than one fusion peptide sequences. We have shown that the internal fusion peptide 1 (IFP1) of SARS-CoV is far more efficient than its N-terminal counterpart (FP) to induce hemifusion between small unilamellar vesicles. Moreover, the ability of IFP1 to induce hemifusion formation increases dramatically with growing cholesterol content in the membrane. Interestingly, IFP1 is capable of inducing hemifusion, but fails to open pore.",Gourab Prasad Pattnaik; Surajit Bhattacharjya; Hirak Chakraborty,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426613,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426613,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,False
61,CAR-NK Cells Effectively Target the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2-infected Cells,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious presenting a significant public health issue. Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants, though the current therapeutic options remain limited and expensive. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet to be documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response. In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in preventing and treating severe cases of COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its D614G mutant. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody that targets the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, therefore would be more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G mutant. Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in vitro and show superior killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently published CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results pave the way for generating  off-the-shelf S309-CAR-NK cells for treatment in high-risk individuals as well as provide an alternative strategy for patients unresponsive to current vaccines.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426742,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426742,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,False
62,"From ""don, doff, and discard"" to ""don, doff, and decontaminate"" - determination of filtering facepiece respirator and surgical mask integrity and inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a small non-enveloped virus following multiple-cycles of vaporised hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, and dry heat decontamination","BackgroundAs the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic accelerates, the supply of personal protective equipment remains under strain. To combat shortages, re-use of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended. Prior decontamination is paramount to the re-use of these typically single-use only items and, without compromising their integrity, must guarantee inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other contaminating pathogens.

AimWe provide information on the effect of time-dependent passive decontamination at room temperature and evaluate inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a non-enveloped model virus as well as mask and respirator integrity following active multiple-cycle vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and dry heat (DH) decontamination.

MethodsMasks and respirators, inoculated with infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus or murine norovirus, were submitted to passive decontamination or single or multiple active decontamination cycles; viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured via TCID50 assay. In parallel, filtration efficiency tests and breathability tests were performed according to EN standard 14683 and NIOSH regulations.

Results and DiscussionInfectious porcine respiratory coronavirus and murine norovirus remained detectable on masks and respirators up to five and seven days of passive decontamination. Single and multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH were shown to not adversely affect bacterial filtration efficiency of masks. Single- and multiple UVGI did not adversely affect respirator filtration efficiency, while VHP and DH induced a decrease in filtration efficiency after one or three decontamination cycles. Multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH slightly decreased airflow resistance of masks but did not adversely affect respirator breathability. VHP and UVGI efficiently inactivated both viruses after five, DH after three, decontamination cycles, permitting demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude.

63,Development and evaluation of rapid data-enabled access to routine clinical information to enhance early recruitment to the national clinical platform trial of COVID-19 community treatments,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for rapidly designing, initiating, and delivering therapeutic clinical trials. PRINCIPLE is the UK national platform investigating repurposed therapies for COVID-19 treatment of older people in the community at high risk of complications. Standard methods of patient recruitment were failing to meet the required pace and scale of enrolment.

This paper describes the development and appraisal of a near real-time, data-driven, ethical approach for enhancing recruitment in community care by contacting people with a recent COVID-19 positive test result from the central NHS Test and Trace service within 24-48 hours of their test result.

MethodsA multi-disciplinary team was formed to solve the technical, ethical, public perception, logistical and information governance issues required to provide a near-real time (within 24-48 hours of receiving a positive test) feed of potential trial participants from test result data to the research team. PRINCIPLE was also given unique access to the Summary Care Record (SCR) to ensure safe prescribing, and to enable the trial team to quickly and safely bring consented patients into the trial. A survey of the public was used to understand public perceptions of the use of test data for this proposed methodology.

ResultsPrior to establishing the data service, PRINCIPLE registered on average 87 participants per week. This increased by up to 87 additional people registered per week from the test data, contributing to an increase from 1,013 recruits to PRINCIPLE at the start of October 2020 to 2,802 recruits by 20th December 2020.

While procedural caveats were identified by the public consultation, out of 2,639 people contacted by PRINCIPLE following a positive test result, no one raised a concern about being approached.

ConclusionsThis paper describes a novel approach to using near-real time NHS operational data to recruit community-based patients within a few days of presentation with acute illness.

This approach increased recruitment, and reduced time between positive test and randomisation, allowing more rapid evaluation of treatments and increased safety for participants. End-to-end public and patient involvement in the design of the approach provided evidence to inform information governance decisions.

Trial registrationPRINCIPLE is funded by UK Research and Innovation and the Department of Health and Social Care through the National Institute for Health Research.

64,"SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a cohort of 43,000 antibody-positive individuals followed for up to 35 weeks","BackgroundReinfection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been documented, raising public health concerns. Risk and incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were assessed in a large cohort of antibody-positive persons in Qatar.

MethodsAll SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons with a PCR-positive swab [&ge;]14 days after the first-positive antibody test were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection.

ResultsAmong 43,044 anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0-34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab [&ge;]14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the risk of reinfection was estimated at 0.10% (95% CI: 0.08-0.11%). The incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at >90%. Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing.

ConclusionsReinfection is rare.

65,From SARS and MERS to COVID-19: a review of the quality and responsiveness of clinical management guidelines in outbreak settings,"ObjectiveTo assess the responsiveness and quality of clinical management guidelines (CMGs) in SARS, MERS and COVID-19 and determine whether this has improved over time.

DesignRapid literature review, quality assessment and focus group consultation.

Data Sources- Google and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception to 6th June 2020.This was supplemented with hand searches of national and international public health agency and infectious disease society websites as well as directly approaching clinical networks in regions where few CMGs had been identified via the primary search.

Eligibility CriteriaCMGs for the treatment of COVID-19/SARS/MERS providing recommendations on supportive care and/or specific treatment.

MethodsData extraction was performed using a standardised form. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE-II) tool was used to evaluate the quality of the CMGs. Six COVID-19 treatments were selected to assess the responsiveness of a subset of guidelines and their updates to 20th November 2020. We ran two sessions of focus groups with patient advocates to elicit their views on guideline development.

ResultsWe included 37 COVID-19, six SARS, and four MERS CMGs. Evidence appraisals in CMGs generally focused on novel drugs rather than basic supportive care; where evidence for the latter was provided it was generally of a low quality. Most CMGs had major methodological flaws (only two MERS-CoV and four COVID-19 CMGs were recommended for use by both reviewers without modification) and there was no evidence of improvement in quality over time. CMGs scored lowest in the following AGREE-II domains: scope and purpose, editorial independence, stakeholder engagement, and rigour of development. Of the COVID-19 CMGs, only eight included specific guidance for the management of elderly patients and only ten for high-risk groups; a further eight did not specify the target patient group at all. Early in the pandemic, multiple guidelines recommended unproven treatments and whilst in general findings of major clinical trials were eventually adopted, this was not universally the case. Eight guidelines recommended that use of unproven agents should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Patient representatives expressed concern about the lack of engagement with them in CMG development and that these documents are not accessible to non-experts.

ConclusionThe quality of most CMGs produced in coronaviridae outbreaks is poor and we have found no evidence of improvement over time, highlighting that current development frameworks must be improved. There is an need to strengthen the evidence base surrounding basic supportive care and develop methods to engage patients in CMG development from the beginning in outbreak settings.

66,"Increased infections, but not viral burden, with a new SARS-CoV-2 variant","BackgroundA new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01, was identified in the UK in December-2020. Direct estimates of its potential to enhance transmission are limited.

MethodsNose and throat swabs from 28-September-2020 to 2-January-2021 in the UKs nationally representative surveillance study were tested by RT-PCR for three genes (N, S and ORF1ab). Those positive only on ORF1ab+N, S-gene target failures (SGTF), are compatible with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. We investigated cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for viral load), percentage of positives, population positivity and growth rates in SGTF vs non-SGTF positives.

Results15,166(0.98%) of 1,553,687 swabs were PCR-positive, 8,545(56%) with three genes detected and 3,531(23%) SGTF. SGTF comprised an increasing, and triple-gene positives a decreasing, percentage of infections from late-November in most UK regions/countries, e.g. from 15% to 38% to 81% over 1.5 months in London. SGTF Ct values correspondingly declined substantially to similar levels to triple-gene positives. Population-level SGTF positivity remained low (<0.25%) in all regions/countries until late-November, when marked increases with and without self-reported symptoms occurred in southern England (to 1.5-3%), despite stable rates of non-SGTF cases. SGTF positivity rates increased on average 6% more rapidly than rates of non-SGTF positives (95% CI 4-9%) supporting addition rather than replacement with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. Excess growth rates for SGTF vs non-SGTF positives were similar in those up to high school age (5% (1-8%)) and older individuals (6% (4-9%)).

67,Correlation of Computerized Tomography (CT) Severity Score for COVID-19 pneumonia with Clinical Outcomes,"IntroductionVarious CT severity scores have already been described in literature since the start of this pandemic. One pertinent issue with all of the previously described severity scores is their relative challenging calculation and variance in inter-observer agreement. The severity score proposed in our study is relatively simpler, easier to calculate and apart from a trained radiologist, can easily be calculated even by physicians with good inter-observer agreement. Therefore, a rapid CT severity score calculation can give a clue to physician about possible clinical outcome without being dependent on radiologist who may not be readily available especially in third world countries.

ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to develop a simple CT severity score (CT-SS) with good inter-observer agreement and access its correlation with clinical outcome.

MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted by the Department of Radiology and Internal Medicine, at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, from April 2020 to August 2020. Non-probability consecutive sampling was used to include all patients who were positive for COVID-19 on PCR, and underwent CT chest examination at AKUH. Severity of disease was calculated in each lobe on the basis of following proposed CT severity scoring system (CT-SS). For each lobe the percentage of involvement by disease was scored - 0% involvement was scored 0, <50% involvement was scored 1 and >50% involvement was scored 2. Maximum score for one lobe was 2 and hence total maximum overall score for all lobes was 10. Continuous data was represented using mean and standard deviation, and compared using independent sample t-tests. Categorical data was represented using frequencies and percentages, and compared using Chi-squared tests. Inter-observer reliability between radiologist and COVID intensivist for the 10 point CT-SS rated on 0-10 was assessed using the Kappa statistic. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.

ResultsA total of 73 patients were included, the majority male (58.9%) with mean age 55.8 {+/-} 13.93 years. The CT-SS rated on 0-10 showed substantial inter-observer reliability between radiologist and intensivist with a Kappa statistic of 0.78. Patients with CT-SS 8-10 had a significantly higher ICU admission & intubation rate (53.8% vs. 23.5%) and mortality rate (35.9% vs. 11.8%; p = 0.017), as compared to those with CT-SS 0-7.

ConclusionWe conclude that the described CT severity score (CT-SS) is a quick, effective and easily reproducible tool for prediction of adverse clinical outcome in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia.

68,Distinct Patterns of Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variants including N501Y in Clinical Samples in Columbus Ohio,"Following the worldwide emergence of the p.Asp614Gly shift in the Spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2, there have been few recurring pathogenic shifts occurring during 2020, as assessed by genomic sequencing. This situation has evolved in the last several months with the emergence of several distinct variants (first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively) that illustrate multiple changes in the S gene, particularly p.Asn501Tyr (N501Y), that likely have clinical impact. We report here the emergence in Columbus, Ohio in December 2020 of two novel SARS-CoV-2 clade 20G variants. One variant, that has become the predominant virus found in nasopharyngeal swabs in the December 2020-January 2021 period, harbors S p.Gln677His (Q677H) membrane glycoprotein (M) p.Ala85Ser (A85S) and nucleocapsid (N) p.Asp377Tyr (D377Y) mutations, with additional S mutations in subsets. The other variant present in two samples, contains S N501Y, which is a marker of the UK-B.1.1.7 (clade 20I/501Y.V1) strain, but lacks all other mutations from that virus. It is from a different clade and shares multiple mutations with the clade 20G viruses circulating in Ohio prior to December 2020.

While valuable, chest imaging currently only detects COVID-19 pneumonia, but if it can predict actual RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 status is unknown. Radiogenomics may provide an effective and accurate RT-PCR-based surrogate.

70,A Viral Fragmentation Signature for SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical Samples Correlating with Contagiousness,"The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples as measured by the primary diagnostic tool of RT-PCR is an imperfect readout for infection potential as most targeted assays designed for sensitivity, indiscriminately detect short and long RNA fragments, although infectivity is embodied only in the whole virus and its intact genome. Here, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize 155 clinical samples and show sensitive and quantitative detection of viral RNA which confirmed subgenomic RNA in 57.6% of samples and provided a novel method to determine relative integrity of viral RNA in samples. The relative abundance of long fragments quantified as a viral fragmentation score was positively associated with viral load and inversely related to time from disease onset. An empirically determined score cut-off for presence of substantially fragmented RNA was able to identify 100% of samples collected after 8 days of illness with poor infection potential in line with current clinical understanding of infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2. The quantification of longer fragments in addition to existing short targets in an NGS or RT-PCR-based assay could provide a valuable readout of infection potential simultaneous to the detection of any fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in test samples.",Yukti Choudhury; Chae Yin Cher; Zi Yi Wan; Chao Xie; Jing Shan Lim; Ramandeep Kaur Virk; Min Han Tan; Alvin Kuo Jing Teo; Li Yang Hsu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249265,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249265,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
71,"Intermediate-dose anticoagulation, aspirin, and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19: a propensity score-matched analysis","BackgroundThrombotic complications occur at high rates in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, yet the impact of intensive antithrombotic therapy on mortality is uncertain.

Research QuestionHow does in-hospital mortality compare with intermediate-versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, and separately with in-hospital aspirin versus no antiplatelet therapy, in treatment of COVID-19?

Study Design and MethodsUsing data from 2785 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients, we established two separate, nested cohorts of patients (1) who received intermediate- or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (""anticoagulation cohort"", N = 1624), or (2) who were not on home antiplatelet therapy and received either in-hospital aspirin or no antiplatelet therapy (""aspirin cohort"", N = 1956). Propensity score matching utilizing various markers of illness severity and other patient-specific covariates yielded treatment groups with well-balanced covariates in each cohort. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

ResultsAmong propensity score-matched patients in the anticoagulation cohort (N = 382), in a multivariable regression model, intermediate-compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.518 [0.308-0.872]). Among propensity-score matched patients in the aspirin cohort (N = 638), in a multivariable regression model, in-hospital aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.522 [0.336-0.812]).

InterpretationIn this propensity score-matched, observational study of COVID-19, intermediate-dose anticoagulation and aspirin were each associated with a lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

We observed higher levels of CCC reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative HCW compared to community donors, consistent with potential higher occupational exposure of HCW to CCC. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of seronegative HCW was higher than community controls and correlation between CCC and SARS-CoV-2 responses is consistent with cross-reactivity and not associated with recent in vivo activation. Surprisingly, CCC reactivity was decreased in SARS-CoV-2 infected HCW, suggesting that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might interfere with CCC responses, either directly or indirectly.

73,Genomic surveillance at scale is required to detect newly emerging strains at an early timepoint,"Genomic surveillance in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has the potential to identify emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains that may be more transmissible, virulent, evade detection by standard diagnostic tests, or vaccine escapes. The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 strain from southern England to other parts of the country and globe is a clear example of the impact of such strains. Early discovery of the B.1.1.7 strain was enabled through the proactive COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) program and the UKs commitment to genomic surveillance, sequencing about 10% of positive samples.1 In order to enact more aggressive public health measures to minimize the spread of such strains, genomic surveillance needs to be of sufficient scale to detect early emergence and expansion in the broader virus population. By modeling common performance characteristics of available diagnostic and sequencing tests, we developed a model that assesses the sampling required to detect emerging strains when they are less than 1% of all strains in a population. This model demonstrates that 5% sampling of all positive tests allows the detection of emerging strains when they are a prevalence of 0.1% to 1.0%. While each country will determine their risk tolerance for the emergence of novel strains, as vaccines are distributed and we work to end the pandemic and prevent future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, genomic surveillance will be an integral part of success.",Darcy Vavrek; Lucia Speroni; Kirsten J Curnow; Michael Oberholzer; Vanessa Moeder; Phillip G Febbo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249613,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249613,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

We conducted a quasi-experimental study from January 1, 2018 to Sept 30, 2020 to investigate the effect of Californias COVID-19 shelter-in-place order on the community transmission of viral, bacterial, and parasitic gastrointestinal pathogens detected with the FilmArray GI Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT). The incidence of viral causes of gastroenteritis, enteroaggregative/enteropathogenic/enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Cyclospora cayetanensis decreased sharply after shelter-in place took effsect, whilst Salmonella, Campylobacter, shiga toxin-producing E. coli (O157 and non-O157) and other bacterial and parasitic causes of gastroenteritis were largely unaffected.

77,An optimised protocol for detection of SARS-COV-2 in stool,"AimSARS-CoV-2 has been detected in stool samples of COVID-19 patients, with potential implications for faecal-oral transmission. Compared to swab samples, the complexity of the stool matrix poses a challenge in the detection of the virus that has not yet been solved. The aim of this study was to establish a sensitive and reliable method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples.

MethodsStool samples from individuals free of SARS-CoV-2 were homogenised in saline buffer and spiked with a known titre of inactivated virus ranging from 50 to 750 viral particles per 100 mg stool. Debris was removed via centrifugation and supernatants were concentrated by ultrafiltration. RNA was then extracted from the concentrated material using a commercial kit and SARS-CoV-2 was detected via real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using the CDC primers and probes.

ResultsThe RNA extraction procedure we used allowed the detection of SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR in most of the stool samples tested. We could detect as few as 50 viral particles per 100 mg of stool. However, high variability was observed across samples at low viral titres. The primer set targeting the N1 region provided more reliable and precise results and for this primer set our method had a limit of detection of 1 viral particle per mg of stool.

ConclusionsHere we describe a sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples. This method can be used to establish the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and ensure the safety of clinical practices such as faecal microbiota transplant (FMT).",Tianqi Li; Enriqueta Garcia-Gutierrez; Jacob Scadden; Jade Davies; Chloe Hutchins; Alp Aydin; Stefano Romano; Lizbeth Sayavedra; Justin O'Grady; Arjan Narbad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.20248606,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.20248606,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
78,Early immune pathology and persistent dysregulation characterise severe COVID-19,"In a study of 207 SARS-CoV2-infected individuals with a range of severities followed over 12 weeks from symptom onset, we demonstrate that an early robust immune response, without systemic inflammation, is characteristic of asymptomatic or mild disease. Those presenting to hospital had delayed adaptive responses and systemic inflammation already evident at around symptom onset. Such early evidence of inflammation suggests immunopathology may be inevitable in some individuals, or that preventative intervention might be needed before symptom onset. Viral load does not correlate with the development of this pathological response, but does with its subsequent severity. Immune recovery is complex, with profound persistent cellular abnormalities correlating with a change in the nature of the inflammatory response, where signatures characteristic of increased oxidative phosphorylation and reactive-oxygen species-associated inflammation replace those driven by TNF and IL-6. These late immunometabolic inflammatory changes and unresolved immune cell defects, if persistent, may contribute to ""long COVID"".",Laura Bergamaschi; Federica Mescia; Lorinda Turner; Aimee Hanson; Prasanti Kotagiri; Benjamin J.

Finally, we assume that the activity index {beta} is proportional to the square of the mobility and fit the parameters.

80,Mitigation of COVID-19 using social distancing of the elderly in Brazil: The vertical quarantine effects in hospitalizations and deaths,"Governments and epidemiologists have been proposing several mitigation strategies based on non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. In this work, we quantitatively compare the effects of elderly population (60 years old or more) selective isolation with a no isolation scenario using an adapted Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Removed (SEIR) compartmental model. For these simulated scenarios, we estimate the number of hospitalizations and deaths for different Brazilian cities, including those due to the lack of hospital beds. Our simulations show that, for Sao Paulo City, the isolation of the elderly would reduce demand for hospital beds by 9% and deaths by 16% compared to the no intervention scenario. Other Brazilian cities follow the same pattern, with median reductions of deaths ranging from 12-18%. We conclude that the social distancing of the elderly would be marginally effective and would not avoid health system collapse in several Brazilian cities.",Vito Ribeiro Venturieri; Matheus Silva Gonçalves; Vinicius Rios Fuck,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249495,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249495,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
81,"Characteristics and outcomes of 118,155 COVID-19 individuals with a history of cancer in the United States and Spain","PurposeWe aimed to describe the demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities and outcomes of patients with a history of cancer with COVID-19 from March to June 2020. Secondly, we compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients hospitalized with influenza.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study using eight routinely-collected healthcare databases from Spain and the US, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model. Three cohorts of patients with a history of cancer were included: i) diagnosed with COVID-19, ii) hospitalized with COVID-19, and iii) hospitalized with influenza in 2017-2018. Patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We reported demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes.

ResultsWe included 118,155 patients with a cancer history in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 41,939 in the COVID-19 hospitalized cohorts. The most frequent cancer subtypes were prostate and breast cancer (range: 5-19% and 1-14% in the diagnosed cohort, respectively). Hematological malignancies were also frequent, with non-Hodgkins lymphoma being among the 5 most common cancer subtypes in the diagnosed cohort. Overall, patients were more frequently aged above 65 years and had multiple comorbidities. Occurrence of death ranged from 8% to 14% and from 18% to 26% in the diagnosed and hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts, respectively. Patients hospitalized with influenza (n=242,960) had a similar distribution of cancer subtypes, sex, age and comorbidities but lower occurrence of adverse events.

83,Impact of COVID-19 on Migrants' Access to Primary Care:A National Qualitative Study,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to considerable changes in the delivery of primary care in the UK, including rapid digitalisation, yet the extent to which these have impacted on marginalised migrant groups - already facing existing barriers to NHS care - is unknown. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of health professionals and migrants will support initiatives to deliver more effective health services, including delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, to marginalised groups.

AimTo understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants and their access to primary healthcare, and implications for COVID-19 vaccine roll out.

Design and SettingPrimary care professionals, administrative staff, and migrants (foreign born; >18 years; <10 years in UK), were recruited in three phases using purposive, convenience and snowball sampling from urban, suburban and rural settings.

MethodsIn-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis.

Results64 clinicians were recruited in Phase 1 (25 GPs, 15 nurses, 7 HCAs, 1 Pharmacists); Phase 2 comprised administrative staff (11 PMs and 5 receptionists); and in Phase 3 we recruited 17 migrants (88% asylum seekers; 65% female; mean time in UK 4 years). We found that digitalisation and virtual consultations (telephone, video, and online form-based) have amplified existing inequalities in access to healthcare for many migrants due to lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers. Use of virtual consultations has resulted in concerns around building trust and the risk of missing safeguarding cues. Participants highlighted challenges around registering and accessing healthcare due to the physical closure of surgeries. Participants reported indirect discrimination, language and communication barriers, and lack of access to targeted and tailored COVID-19 information or interventions. In addition, migrants reported a range of specific beliefs around COVID-19 and on potential COVID-19 vaccines, from acceptance to mistrust, often influenced by misinformation. PCPs raised concerns that migrants may have increased risk factors for poor general health and to severe illness from COVID-19, in part due to their social and economic situation. Innovative opportunities were suggested to engage migrant groups through translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube which merit further exploration.

ConclusionPandemic-related changes in primary care delivery may be here to stay, and some migrant groups are at risk of digital exclusion and may need targeted additional support to access services. As primary care networks operationalise the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, these findings provide critical information on specific strategies required to support migrant population to access primary care and overcome misinformation around COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine.

How this fits inThe impact of pandemic-related shifts in primary care delivery on marginalised migrant groups, who may already face major disparities in accessing primary care, is poorly elucidated. We found that the rapid digitalisation of primary care services and physical closure of surgeries during the pandemic have amplified disparities in access to healthcare for specific migrant groups, with many lacking access to and capacity to use technology, compounded by language barriers. Migrants may be at increased risk of misinformation about COVID-19, which merits further consideration as COVID-19 vaccine roll out begins. Improved outreach to local migrant community organisations and places of worship, alongside co-designing with migrants more inclusive delivery approaches and creative integration of migrant ambassadors into information-sharing campaigns are needed. Primary care can maximise the opportunities of digitalisation for migrants through flexible engagement by multiple modalities (e.g. text, email, letter and YouTube videos) to provide targeted, translated advice and information, virtual group consultations for patients with a specific condition, and working with local leaders and NGOs to access and disseminate information through informal communication channels.",Felicity Knights; Jessica Carter; Anna Deal; Alison F Crawshaw; Sally E Hayward; Lucinda Jones; Sally Hargreaves,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249692,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249692,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
84,Physicians' Reactions to COVID-19: The Results of an International Internet Survey,"ObjectivesPhysicians across the world have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was designed and conducted to assess the emotional, cognitive, and behavioural reactions of physicians to the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Materials and methodsAn online survey questionnaire using the google forms platform was constructed by the authors. The items in the questionnaire were based on clinical experience, relevant literature review and discussion with peers. A list of issues that were deemed as essential components of the experience of the pandemic relevant to physicians was arrived at. Thereafter these issues were operationalized into question form and hosted on the google forms platform. The link to this questionnaire was circulated by the authors among their peer groups in the month of April 2020.

ResultsWe received 295 responses and 3 were unusable. Most of the responses were from India, the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. About 60% of the respondents identified themselves as frontline and had a decade of clinical experience. Most respondents reported being anxious due to the pandemic and also observed the same in their peers and families. A majority also observed changes in behaviour in self and others and advanced a variety of reasons and concerns. A sense of duty was the most commonly employed coping mechanism.

ConclusionPhysicians are not immune from information and misinformation, or cues in the environment. Behavioural choices are not always predicted by knowledge but by a combination of knowledge, emotional state, personality and environment. Healthcare settings need to be ready for emergencies and should focus on reducing uncertainty in physicians. These factors may also be gainfully used in the mental health promotion of physicians in COVID-19 care roles.",Parul Aneja; Inderjit Singh; Bhupinder Singh; Pardeep Singh Kundi; Inderbir Singh; Sanjana Kathiravan; Shubh Mohan Singh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249460,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249460,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

ResultsThe present study included 496 health care employees, 55% were at age group from 18-45 years old. History of chronic diseases was recorded in 40.4%, and definite history of drug/food allergy in 10.1%. Only 13.5% totally agree to receive the vaccine, 32.4% somewhat agree and 40.9% disagreed to take the vaccine. Causes of disagreement were none safety, fear of genetic mutation and recent techniques and believe that the vaccine is not effective (57%, 20.2%, 17.7% and 16.6% respectively). The most trusted vaccine was the mRNA based vaccine. The age of health care employees and the presence of comorbidities or chronic diseases were the main factors related to COVID-19 acceptance (P<0.001 and 0.02 respectively).

ConclusionVaccine hesitancy is not uncommon in healthcare employees in Egypt and this may be an alarming barrier of vaccine acceptance in the rest of population. There is an urgent need to start campaigns to increase the awareness of the vaccine importance.",Aliae AR Mohamed-Hussein; islam g sayed; nahed Makhlouf; Hoda Makhlouf; Howaida Abd El Aal; Karima Kholief; Mahmoud M Saad; Doaa Abdeltawab Abdellal,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249324,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249324,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
86,Changes in the Health of Adolescent Athletes: A Comparison of Health Measures Collected Before and During the CoVID-19 Pandemic,"ContextIn the spring of 2020, schools closed to in-person teaching and sports were cancelled to control the transmission of CoVID-19. The changes that took place to the physical and mental health among young athletes during this time remain unknown, however.

ObjectiveIdentify changes in the health (mental health, physical activity and quality of life) of athletes that occurred during the CoVID-19 pandemic.

DesignCross sectional study.

SettingSample recruited via social media.

Patients or Other Participants3243 Wisconsin adolescent athletes (age=16.2{+/-}1.2 yrs., female=58% female) completed an online survey in May 2020 (DuringCoVID-19). Health measures for this cohort were compared with previously reported data for Wisconsin adolescent athletes (n=5231, age=15.7{+/-}1.2, 47% female) collected in 2016-2018 (PreCoVID-19).

Main Outcome Measure(s)Demographic information included: sex, grade and sports played. Health assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) to identify depression symptoms, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for health related quality of life (HRQoL). Univariable comparisons of these variables between groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each group were estimated by survey weighted ANOVA models.

RESULTSCompared to PreCoVID-19, a larger proportion of the During-CoVID-19 participants reported rates of moderate to severe levels of depression (9.7% vs 32.9%, p<0.001). During-CoVID-19 participants reported 50% lower (worse) PFABS scores (mean:12.2 [95%CI: 11.9, 12.5] vs 24.7 [24.5, 24.9] p<0.001) and lower (worse) PedsQL total scores compared to the PreCoVID-19 participants (78.4 [78.0, 78.8] vs. 90.9 [90.5, 91.3] p<0.001).

CONCLUSIONSDuring the CoVID-19 pandemic, adolescent athletes reported increased symptoms of depression, decreased physical activity and decreased quality of life compared to adolescent athletes in previous years.

Key pointsO_LIAdolescent athletes during CoVID-19 were three times more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of depression compared to data collected prior to CoVID-19.

87,Regional Variation in COVID-19 Scarce Resource Allocation Protocols,"BackgroundScarce resource allocation policies vary across the United States. Little is known about regional variation in hospital-level resource allocation protocols and variation in their application.

ObjectiveTo evaluate how scarce resource allocation policies throughout the Chicagoland area vary and whether there are differences in policy application within and amongst hospitals.

DesignTwo cross-sectional surveys.

SettingChicagoland hospitals.

ParticipantsRepresentatives from Chicagoland hospitals and triage officers at these hospitals.

MeasurementsSurvey responses and categorical variables are described by frequency of occurrence. Intra- and interhospital variation in ranking of hypothetical patients was assessed using Kappa coefficients.

ResultsEight Chicago area hospitals responded to the survey assessing scarce resource allocation protocols. For hospitals willing to describe their specific ventilator allocation protocol (n=7), the initial scoring system varied with most utilizing the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (86%) and medical comorbidities (57%). A majority gave priority to pre-defined groups in their initial scoring system (86%), all discussed withdrawal of mechanical ventilation for adult patients (100%), and a minority had exclusion criteria (43%). Forty-nine triage officers from nine hospitals responded to the second survey. Triage officer rankings of hypothetical patients had slight agreement amongst all hospitals (Kappa 0.158) and fair agreement within two hospitals with the most respondents (Kappa 0.21 and 0.25). Almost half of triage officer respondents reported using tiebreakers to rank patients (N=23/49, 47%).

ConclusionAlthough most Chicago area hospitals surveyed created guidelines for resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic, these guidelines and application of these protocols by triage officers varied significantly.

Although the majority of infections are mild, severe and critical COVID-19 patients face deterioration of respiratory function, and may also present extrapulmonary manifestations, mostly affecting the kidney, digestive tract, heart and nervous system. Here, we prospectively evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material by RT-PCR in urine samples obtained from critical care COVID-19 patients. In 51 patients included, we found higher serum creatinine levels, a longer hospital stay and a more frequent dialysis need in urine-positive patients.

89,Real-Time Electronic Health Record Mortality Prediction During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Cohort Study,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions of people, overwhelming critical care resources in some regions. Many plans for rationing critical care resources during crises are based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The COVID-19 pandemic created an emergent need to develop and validate a novel electronic health record (EHR)-computable tool to predict mortality.

Research QuestionsTo rapidly develop, validate, and implement a novel real-time mortality score for the COVID-19 pandemic that improves upon SOFA.

Study Design and MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study of a regional health system with 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. All patients >14 years old hospitalized during the study period without a do not resuscitate order were included. Patients were stratified by the diagnosis of COVID-19. From this cohort, we developed and validated a model using stacked generalization to predict mortality using data widely available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index.

ResultsWe prospectively analyzed 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) included intensive care unit (ICU)-level care, 1,480 (5.4%) included invasive mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted overall mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted overall mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, we predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85.

InterpretationWe developed and validated an accurate, in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model, that improved upon SOFA.

Take Home PointsO_ST_ABSStudy QuestionC_ST_ABSCan we improve upon the SOFA score for real-time mortality prediction during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging electronic health record (EHR) data?

ResultsWe rapidly developed and implemented a novel yet SOFA-anchored mortality model across 12 hospitals and conducted a prospective cohort study of 27,296 adult hospitalizations, 1,358 (5.0%) of which were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted all-cause mortality with AUROCs of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted mortality with AUROC 0.94.

91,COVID-19 dynamics in an Ohio prison,"ImportanceIncarcerated individuals are a vulnerable population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in prisons is crucial for curbing transmission both within correctional facilities and in the surrounding community.

ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to identify transmission scenarios that could underly rapid, widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection among inmates in Marion Correctional Institution (MCI).

DesignPublicly available data reported by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections (ODRC) was analyzed using mathematical and statistical models.

SettingWe consider SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics among MCI inmates prior to and including April 16, 2020.

ParticipantsThis study uses de-identified, publicly available SARS-CoV-2 test result data for MCI inmates.

ExposuresInmates at MCI were considered exposed to potential infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Main outcome and measuresResults from mass testing conducted on April 16, 2020 were analyzed together with time of first reported SARS-CoV-2 infection among MCI inmates.

ResultsRapid, widespread infection of MCI inmates was reported, with nearly 80% of inmates infected within three weeks of first reported inmate case. These data are consistent with i) a basic reproduction number greater than 14, together with a single initially infected inmate, ii) an initial super-spreading event resulting in several hundred initially infected inmates, together with a basic reproduction number of approximately three, and iii) earlier undetected circulation of virus among inmates prior to April.

Conclusions and relevanceMass testing data are consistent with extreme transmissibility, super-spreading events, or undetected circulation of virus among inmates. All scenarios consistent with these data attest to the vulnerabilities of prisoners to COVID-19.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSTo identify transmission characteristics consistent with timing and extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection among inmates in Marion Correctional Institution.

FindingsMathematical and statistical modeling finds three scenarios that are consistent with the observed widespread infection in Marion Correctional Institution: i) very high transmissibility corresponding to a basic reproduction number in the double digits, ii) an initial super-spreading event involving exposure of several hundred inmates, iii) undetected circulation of virus prior to the first documented case among inmates.

92,Estimating and forecasting the burden and spread of SARS-CoV2 first wave in Colombia.,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWFollowing the rapid dissemination of COVID-19 cases in Colombia in 2020, large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented as national emergencies in most of the municipalities of the country starting by a lockdown on March 20th of 2020. Using combinations of meta-population models SEAIIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infected-Recovered-Diseased) which describes the disease dynamics in the different localities, with movement data that accounts for the number of commuters between units and statistical inference algorithms could be an effective approach to both nowcast and forecast the number of cases and deaths in the country. Here we used an iterated filtering (IF) framework to fit the parameters of our model to the reported data across municipalities from march to late October in locations with more than 50 reported deaths and cases historically. Since the model is high dimensional (6 state variable by municipality) inference on those parameters is highly non-trivial, so we used an Ensemble-Adjustment-Kalman-Filter (EAKF) to estimate time variable system states and parameters. Our results show that the model is capable of capturing the evolution of the outbreak in the country and providing estimates of the epidemiological parameters in time. These estimates could become the base for planning future interventions as well as evaluate the impact of NPIs on the effective reproductive number ([R]eff) and the key epidemiological parameters, such as the contact rate or the reporting rate. Our approach demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts can provide robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in Colombia. This model has the potential to be used as a forecasting and prediction tool to evaluate disease dynamics and to develop a real time surveillance system for management and control.",Jaime Enrique Cascante Vega; Juan Manuel Cordovez; Mauricio Santos-Vega Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249818,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249818,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
93,Comparison and analysis of various complementary diagnosis methods for the current situation and problems of COVID-19 diagnosis,"We evaluated and compared the diagnostic performance of fluorescence immunoassay (FIA) and two types of serological diagnostic tests: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody to diagnose COVID-19 infections. This study is aimed to analyze and compare the current status and problems of COVID-19 diagnosis and various alternative diagnostic methods that are viable. The enrolled subjects in our study population were tested with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ELISA and immunochromatographic diagnostic kit were used to diagnose 362 positive and 3010 negative SARS-CoV-2 specimens, and antigen fluorescence immunoassay kit was used on 62 positive and 70 negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed samples for diagnosis. As a result, categorizing by the patient symptom onset days, PCL COVID19 Total Ab EIA (ELISA) showed the sensitivity of 93.4% from 15 to 21 days, 94.2% from over 22 days, and the specificity of 99.97%. PCL COVID19 IgG/IgM Rapid Gold (ICA) had a sensitivity of 86.9%, 97.4%, and the specificity of 98.14% respectively. PCL COVID19 Ag Rapid FIA sensitivity was 93.8% from 0 to 7 days, 71.4% from 8 to 12 days and specificity was 98.57%.

94,"SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, transmission, health-related outcomes and control strategies in homeless shelters: systematic review and meta-analysis","BackgroundPeople experiencing homelessness (PEH) may be at particular risk for COVID19. We synthesised the evidence on SARS-Cov-2 infection, transmission, outcomes of disease, effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and the effectiveness of targeted strategies for infection prevention and control (IPC).

MethodsSystematic review of articles, reports and grey-literature indexed in electronic databases (EMBASE, WHO-Covid19, Web of Science), pre-print repositories, institutional websites, and handsearching. Empirical papers of any study design addressing Covid-19 in PEH or homeless shelters staff in English were included. (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020187033)

FindingsOf 194 publications, 13 studies were included (two modelling, ten observational and one qualitative study). All were conducted in high-income countries. Random-effect meta-analysis of prevalence estimates yields a baseline SARS-Cov-2 prevalence of 2{middle dot}14% (95% Confidence-Interval, 95%CI=1{middle dot}02-3{middle dot}27) in PEH and 1{middle dot}72 % (95%CI=0{middle dot}31-3{middle dot}12) in staff. In outbreaks, the pooled prevalence increases to 29{middle dot}49% (95%CI=16{middle dot}44-29{middle dot}55) in PEH and 15{middle dot}18% (95%CI=8{middle dot}95-21{middle dot}42) in staff. Main IPC strategies were universal and rapid testing, expansion of non-congregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters (bed spacing, limited staff rotation).

InterpretationUp to 30% PEH and 17% staff are infected during outbreaks of SARS-Cov-2 in homeless shelters. Most studies were conducted in the USA. No studies were found on health-related outcomes or health effects of NPI. An overview and evaluation of IPC strategies for PEH, including a better understanding of disease transmission, and reliable data on PEH within Covid-19 notification systems is needed. Qualitative studies may serve to voice PEH experiences and guide future evaluations and IPC strategies.

FundingNo source of funding.

Panel 1: Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPeople experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at increased risk of infectious, chronic, and mental health adverse conditions. Due to the risk of transmission in shared accommodations, PEH may be particularly vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken to mitigate the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak may have further aggravated health and social conditions. However, there is no evidence synthesis on the SARS-Cov-2 epidemiology among PEH, the correspondent clinical and other health-related outcomes as well as health effects of NPIs on these groups.

Added value of this study

We reviewed and synthesized existent evidence on the risk of infection and transmission, risk of severe course of disease, effect of NPIs on health outcomes and the effectiveness of implemented measures to avert risks and negative outcomes among PEH. Results of the identified studies suggest that both PEH and shelter staff are at high risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection, especially in case of a local outbreak. Due to the low prevalence of symptoms at the time of a positive SARS-Cov-2 test among PEH, symptom screening alone may not be efficient to control outbreaks. Instead, universal and rapid testing conjugated with expansion of non-congregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters, are discussed as sensible strategies.

Implications of all the available evidence

A comprehensive overview of NPIs and shelter strategies targeting PEH and evaluation of their effectiveness and unintended health consequences is needed.

95,COVID-19: Rapid Antigen detection for SARS-CoV-2 by lateral flow assay: a national systematic evaluation for mass-testing,"BackgroundNew lateral flow device (LFD) viral antigen immunoassays have been developed by commercial and research organisations around the world as diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To support decisions by the UK Government on potential scale-up of mass population testing, we have at their request evaluated the diagnostic performance of a significant number of point-of-care rapid SARS-CoV-2 LFDs.

Methods132 LFDs were initially reviewed by a Department of Health and Social Care team, part of the UK government, from which 64 were selected for further evaluation. Standardised laboratory evaluations, and for those that met the published criteria, field testing in the Falcon-C19 research study and UK pilots were performed (UK COVID-19 testing centres, hospital, schools, armed forces).

Results4/64 LFDs so far have desirable performance characteristics from independent laboratory studies and early preliminary field evaluations (Orient Gene, Deepblue and Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test), of which one underwent extended clinical assessment in field studies (Innova). 8951 Innova LFD tests were performed with a kit failure rate of 5.6% (502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1-6.1), false positive rate of 0.32% (22/6954, 95% CI: 0.20-0.48) and a viral antigen detection/sensitivity (using RNA RT-PCR as a proxy for the presence of antigen) of 78.8% when performed by laboratory scientists (156/198, 95% CI 72.4-84.3). Sensitivity was significantly lower when testing was undertaken by non-experts with limited initial training

InterpretationSeveral LFDs have promising performance characteristics for mass population testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals. The Innova LFD shows good viral antigen detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential issues. These results support the expanded evaluation of LFDs, and assessment of greater access to testing on COVID-19 transmission.

96,Understanding COVID-19 dynamics and the effects of interventions in the Philippines: A mathematical modelling study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 appears to have caused less severe outbreaks in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) compared with high-income countries, possibly because of differing demographics, socio-economics, climate, surveillance, and policy responses. The Philippines is a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak but has recently curtailed transmission while gradually easing interventions.

MethodsWe applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a ""Minimum Health Standards"" policy, MHS) to represent the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and projected the impacts of easing interventions.

ResultsPopulation age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. Several of the fitted epidemiological parameters were consistent with those reported in high-income settings. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 15-32%. The December 2020 case detection rate was estimated at [~]14%, population recovered at [~]12%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, and mobility, and the epidemic can be understood within a similar framework as for high-income settings. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS measures should allow the Philippines to maintain epidemic control, but disease resurgence remains a threat due to low population immunity and detection rates.",Jamie M Caldwell; Elvira de Lara-Tuprio; Timothy Robin Y Teng; Maria Regina Justina E Estuar; Raymond Francis Sarmiento; Milinda Abayawardana; Robert Neil F Leong; Richard T Gray; James G Wood; Emma McBryde; Romain Ragonnet; James M Trauer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249848,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249848,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
97,The cellular immune response to COVID-19 deciphered by single cell multi-omics across three UK centres,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in excess morbidity and mortality as well as economic decline. To characterise the systemic host immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing coupled with analysis of cell surface proteins, providing molecular profiling of over 800,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 130 patients with COVID-19. Our cohort, from three UK centres, spans the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease severities ranging from asymptomatic to critical. Three control groups were included: healthy volunteers, patients suffering from a non-COVID-19 severe respiratory illness and healthy individuals administered with intravenous lipopolysaccharide to model an acute inflammatory response. Full single cell transcriptomes coupled with quantification of 188 cell surface proteins, and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoires have provided several insights into COVID-19: 1. a new non-classical monocyte state that sequesters platelets and replenishes the alveolar macrophage pool; 2. platelet activation accompanied by early priming towards megakaryopoiesis in immature haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and expansion of megakaryocyte-primed progenitors; 3. increased clonally expanded CD8+ effector:effector memory T cells, and proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with more severe disease; and 4. relative increase of IgA plasmablasts in asymptomatic stages that switches to expansion of IgG plasmablasts and plasma cells, accompanied with higher incidence of BCR sharing, as disease severity increases. All data and analysis results are available for interrogation and data mining through an intuitive web portal. Together, these data detail the cellular processes present in peripheral blood during an acute immune response to COVID-19, and serve as a template for multi-omic single cell data integration across multiple centers to rapidly build powerful resources to help combat diseases such as COVID-19.",Emily Stephenson; Gary Reynolds; Rachel A Botting; Fernando J Calero-Nieto; Michael Morgan; Zewen Kelvin Tuong; Karsten Bach; Waradon Sungnak; Kaylee B Worlock; Masahiro Yoshida; Natsuhiko Kumasaka; Katarzyna Kania; Justin Engelbert; Bayanne Olabi; Jarmila Stremenova Spegarova; Nicola K Wilson; Nicole Mende; Laura Jardine; Louis CS Gardner; Issac Goh; Dave Horsfall; Jim McGrath; Simone Webb; Michael W Mather; Rik GH Lindeboom; Emma Dann; Ni Huang; Krzysztof Polanski; Elena Prigmore; Florian Gothe; Jonathan Scott; Rebecca P Payne; Kenneth F Baker; Aidan T Hanrath; Ina CD Schim van der Loeff; Andrew S Barr; Amada Sanchez-Gonzalez; Laura Bergamaschi; Federica Mescia; Josephine L Barnes; Eliz Kilich; Angus de Wilton; Anita Saigal; Aarash Saleh; Sam M Janes; Claire M Smith; Nusayhah Gopee; Caroline Wilson; Paul Coupland; Jonathan M Coxhead; Vladimir Y Kiselev; Stijn van Dongen; Jaume Bacardit; Hamish W King; Anthony J Rostron; A John Simpson; Sophie Hambleton; Elisa Laurenti; Paul A Lyons; Kerstin B Meyer; Marko Z Nikolic; Christopher JA Duncan; Ken Smith; Sarah A Teichmann; Menna R Clatworthy; John C Marioni; Berthold Gottgens; Muzlifah Haniffa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249725,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249725,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

High level IgG, IgM and IgA reactivity to structural proteins S, M and N, as well as accessory proteins, of SARS-CoV-2 were observed that was specific to COVID-19 patients. Overlapping 100, 50 and 30 amino acid fragments of SARS-CoV-2 proteins identified antigenic regions. Numerous proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were also more reactive with IgG, IgM and IgA in COVID-19 patient sera than in unexposed control sera, providing further evidence of immunologic cross-reactivity between these viruses. The multi-coronavirus protein microarray is a useful tool for mapping antibody reactivity in COVID-19 patients.",David Camerini; Arlo Z Randall; Krista Trappl-Kimmons; Amit Oberai; Christopher Hung; Joshua Edgar; Adam Shandling; Vu Huynh; Andy A Teng; Gary Hermanson; Jozelyn V Pablo; Megan M Stumpf; Sandra N Lester; Jennifer Harcourt; Azaibi Tamin; Mohammed Rasheed; Natalie J Thornburg; Panayampalli S Satheshkumar; Xiaowu Liang; Richard B Kennedy; Angela Yee; Michael Townsend; Joseph J Campo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249690,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249690,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
99,Real-time optical analysis of a colorimetric LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva with a handheld instrument improves accuracy compared to endpoint assessment,"Controlling the course of the COVID-19 pandemic will require widespread deployment of consistent and accurate diagnostic testing of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, tests should detect a minimum viral load, be minimally invasive, and provide a rapid and simple readout. Current FDA-approved RT-qPCR-based standard diagnostic approaches require invasive nasopharyngeal swabs and involve laboratory-based analyses that can delay results. Recently, a loop mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) test that utilizes colorimetric readout received FDA approval. This approach utilizes a pH indicator dye to detect drop in pH from nucleotide hydrolysis during nucleic acid amplification. This method has only been approved for use with RNA extracted from clinical specimens collected via nasopharyngeal swabs. In this study, we developed a quantitative LAMP-based strategy to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. Our detection system distinguished positive from negative sample types using a handheld instrument that monitors optical changes throughout the LAMP reaction. We used this system in a streamlined LAMP testing protocol that could be completed in less than two hours to directly detect inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in minimally processed saliva that bypassed RNA extraction, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 genomes/reaction. The quantitative method correctly detected virus in 100% of contrived clinical samples spiked with inactivated SARS- CoV-2 at either 1X (50 genomes/reaction) or 2X (100 genomes/reaction) of the LOD. Importantly the quantitative method was based on dynamic optical changes during the reaction so was able to correctly classify samples that were misclassified by endpoint observation of color.",Lena Diaz; Brandon E.

100,"A Novel Multiplex PCR Based Detection Assay Using Saliva or Nasopharyngeal Samples for SARS-Cov-2, Influenza A and B: Clinical Validation and Utility for Mass Surveillance.","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant diversion of human and material resources to COVID-19 diagnostics, to the extent that testing of viral pathogens normally contributing to seasonal respiratory tract infections have been markedly neglected. The global health burden due to influenza viruses and co-infection in COVID-19 patients remains undocumented but clearly pose serious public health consequences. To address these clinical and technical challenges, we have optimized and validated a highly sensitive RT-PCR based multiplex assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and B viruses in a single test.

MethodsThis study evaluated clinical specimens (n=1411) that included 1019 saliva and 392 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples collected in either healthcare or community setting. Samples were tested using two assays: FDA-EUA approved SARS-CoV-2 assay that targets N and ORF1ab gene, and the PKamp RT-PCR based assay that targets SARS-CoV-2, Influenza viruses A and B. The limit of detection (LoD) studies was conducted as per the FDA guidelines using SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A and B reference control materials.

ResultsOf the 1019 saliva samples, 17.0% (174/1019) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either assay. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with our multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [91.9% (160/174) vs. 87.9% (153/174)], respectively. Of the 392 NPS samples, 10.4% (41/392) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either assay. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with our multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [97.5% (40/41) vs. 92.1% (39/41)], respectively. The Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 were comparable between the two assays, whereas the Ct values of the housekeeping gene was significantly lower with multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay. The LoD was established as 60 copies/ml for SARS-CoV-2 and 180 copies/ml for Influenza A and B viruses for both saliva and NPS samples.

ConclusionThis study presents clinical validation of a multiplex PCR assay for testing SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and B viruses, using NPS and saliva samples, and demonstrates the feasibility of implementing the assay without disrupting the existing laboratory workflow. This novel assay uses the same instruments, sample types, supplies, and laboratory personnel as needed for the testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Nikhil Shri Sahajpal; Ashis K Mondal; Sudha Ananth; Allan Njau; Pankaj Ahluwalia; Eesha Oza; Ted Ross; Vamsi Kota; Arvind Kothandaraman; Sadanand Fulzele; Madhuri Hegde; Alka Chaubey; Amyn M Rojiani; Ravindra Kolhe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249629,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249629,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
101,Mass Testing with Contact Tracing Compared to Test and Trace for Effective Suppression of COVID-19 in the UK: A rapid review,"BackgroundMaking testing available to everyone and tracing contacts might be the gold standard towards the control of COVID-19, particularly when significant transmissions are without symptoms. This study evaluated the effectiveness of mass testing and contact tracing in the suppression of COVID-19 compared to conventional Test and Trace in the UK.

DesignA rapid review of available evidence

Primary research questionIs there evidence that mass testing and tracing could suppress community spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections better than Test and Trace?

Secondary research questionWhat is the proportion of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported during mass testing interventions?

MethodsLiterature was searched in September through December 2020 in Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Mendeley and PubMed.

ResultsLiterature search yielded 286 articles from Google Scholar, 20 from Science Direct, 14 from Mendeley, 27 from Pubmed and 15 through manual search. Altogether 35 articles were included, making a sample size of close to a million participants.

ConclusionThere was a very low level but promising evidence of 76.9% (95% CI: 46.2 - 95.0, P=0.09) majority vote in favour of the intervention under the primary objective. The overall proportion of asymptomatic cases among those tested positive and tested sample populations under the secondary objective was 40.7% (95% CI: 38.8- 42.5) and 0.01% (95% CI: 0.01 - 0.012) respectively.

102,Nasopharyngeal and serological anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA responses in COVID-19 patients.,"BackgroundThe systemic antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients has been extensively studied. However, much less is known about the mucosal responses in the upper airways at the site of initial SARS-CoV-2 replication. Local antibody responses in the nasopharyngeal epithelium, that are likely to determine the course of infection, have not been analysed so far nor their correlation with antibody responses in serum.

MethodsThe IgG and IgA antibody responses were analysed in the plasma as well as in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from the first four COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR in France. Two were pauci-symptomatic while two developed severe disease. Taking advantage of a comprehensive series of plasma and nasopharyngeal samples, we characterized their antibody profiles from the second week post symptoms onset, by using an in-house ELISA to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (N) IgG and IgA.

ResultsAnti-N IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in the NPS of severe patients. Overall, the levels of IgA and IgG antibodies in plasma and NPS appeared specific to each patient.

ConclusionsAnti-N IgG and IgA antibodies are detected in NPS, and their levels are related to antibody levels in plasma. The two patients with severe disease exhibited different antibody profiles that may reflect different disease outcome. For the pauci-symptomatic patients, one showed a low anti-N IgG and IgA response in the plasma only, while the other one did not exhibit overt serological response.",Bernadette Crescenzo-Chaigne; Sylvie Behillil; Vincent Enouf; Nicolas Escriou; Stephane Petres; Marie Noelle Ungeheuer; Jade Ghosn; Sarah Tubiana; Lila Bouadma; Sylvie van der Werf; Caroline Demeret; - French COVID cohort study group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.20249038,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.20249038,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
103,School and community reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mathematical modeling study,"BackgroundThe closure of communities, including schools, has been adopted to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in most countries. Operating schools safely during the pandemic requires a balance between health risks and the need for in-person learning. We use compartmental models to explore school reopening scenarios.

MethodsUsing demographic and epidemiological data between July 31 and November 23, 2020 from the city of Toronto, we developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Isolated model. Our model with age, household, and community transmission allow us to study the impact of schools open in September 2020. The model mimics the transmission in households, the community, and schools, accounting for differences in infectiousness between adults and children and youth and adults working status. We assessed the extent to which school opening may have contributed to COVID-19 resurgence in the fall and simulated scenarios for the safe reopening of schools up to May 31, 2021. We further considered the impact of the introduction of the new variant of concern.

FindingsThough a slight increase in infections among adults (2.8%) and children (5.4%) is anticipated by the end of the year, safe school opening is possible with stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) decreasing the risk of transmission in the community and the household. We found that while school reopening was not the key driver in virus resurgence, but rather it was community spread that determined the outbreak trajectory, brief school closures did reduce infections when transmission risk within the home was low. When considered possible cross-infection amongst households, communities, and schools, we found that home transmission was crucial for mitigating the epidemic and safely operating schools. Simulating the introduction of a new strain with higher infectiousness, we observed substantial increases in infections, even when both schools and communities are closed.

InterpretationSchools can open safely under strict maintenance of strict public health measures in the community. The gradual opening of schools and communities can only be achieved by maintaining NPIs and mitigating household transmission risk to avoid the broader escape of infections acquired in schools into the community via households. If the new COVID-19 strain is more infectious for children, public spaces, including schools, should be closed, and additional NPIs, including the use of masks, should be extended to toddlers.

FundingThis research was supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and York University Research Chair program.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe design of a gradual school reopening strategy remains at the heart of decision-making on reopening after shut-downs to control the epidemic. Although available studies have assessed the risk of school reopening by modelling the transmission across schools and communities, it remains unclear whether the risk is due to increased transmission in adults or children and youth.We used GoogleScholar and PubMed searches to identify previous published works. We used te following terms: ""school closure"", ""covid 19 school closure"", ""reopening schools"", ""reopening screening school"", ""school household second wave model"". The search of the studies ended in January 2021. Papers in other languages than English and letters were excluded from the search. Two modelling studies examined the effects of screening and delayed school reopening, two other agent-based modelling studies explored the epidemic spread across different age groups.

Added-value of this studyWe find that the resurgence of COVID-19 in Toronto in fall 2020 mainly resulted from the increase of contact rate among adults in the community, and that the degree of in-person attendance had the most significant impact on transmission in schools. To our knowledge, our work is the first to investigate the resurgence in infections following school reopening and the impact of risk mitigation measures in schools operation during the pandemic. Our novel and comprehensive model considers the age and household structure, but also considers three different settings, school, household and community. We further examined the effects of self-screening procedures, class size, and schooling days on transmission, which enabled us to compare scenarios of school reopening separately for both adults and children and youth, and model the cross-infection between them to avoid potential underestimation. We found that after schools opened, reducing household transmission was crucial for mitigating the epidemic since it can reduce cross-infection amongst households, communities and schools. Lastly, given the recent report of SARS-CoV-2 variant (VOC202012/01), we investigated the impact of the new variant that may be more infectious in children and youth.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur analysis can inform policymakers of planning the safe reopening of schools during COVID-19. We suggest that integrating strict NPIs and school control measures are crucial for safe reopening. When schools are open, reducing transmission risk at home and community is paramount in curbing the spread of COVID-19. Lastly, if children are more susceptible to the new COVID-19 VOC, both schools and community must be closed, the time children spend in essential services locations minimized, and NPIs for those aged less than three years enforced.",Pei Yuan; Elena Aruffo; Nicholas ogden; Yi Tan; Evgenia Gatov; Effie Gournis; Sarah Collier; Qi Li; Iain Moyles; Nasri Bouchra; Huaiping Zhu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249753,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249753,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
104,An optimized stepwise algorithm combining rapid antigen and RT-qPCR for screening of COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundDiagnosing SARS CoV-2 infection with certainty is essential for appropriate case management. We investigated the combination of rapid antigen detection (RAD) and RT-qPCR assays in a stepwise procedure to optimize the detection of COVID-19.

MethodsFrom August 2020 to November 2020, 43,399 patients were screened in our laboratory for COVID-19 diagnostic by RT-qPCR using nasopharyngeal swab. Overall, 4,691 of the 43,399 were found to be positive, and 200 were retrieved for RAD testing allowing comparison of diagnostic accuracy between RAD and RT-qPCR. Cycle threshold (Ct) and time from symptoms onset (TSO) were included as covariates.

ResultsThe overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR-, and LR+ of RAD compared with RT- qPCR were 72% (95%CI 62%-81%), 99% (95% CI95%-100%), 99% (95%CI 93%-100%), and 78% (95%CI 70%-85%), 0.28 (95%CI 0.21-0.39), and 72 (95%CI 10-208) respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with Ct [&le;] 25 regardless of TSO: TSO [&le;] 4 days 92% (95%CI 75%-99%), TSO > 4 days 100% (95%CI 54%-100%), and asymptomatic 100% (95%CI 78-100%). Overall, combining RAD and RT-qPCR would allow reducing from only 4% the number of RT-qPCR needed.

ConclusionThis study highlights the risk of misdiagnosing COVID-19 in 28% of patients if RAD is used alone. Thus, negative results from RAD needs to be confirmed by RT-qPCR prior to making treatment decisions. A stepwise analysis that combines RAD and RT-qPCR would be an efficient screening procedure for COVID-19 detection and may facilitate the control of the outbreak.",Philippe HALFON; Guillaume PENARANDA; Hacene KHIRI; Vincent GARCIA; Hortense DROUET; Patrick PHILIBERT; Christina PSOMAS; Marion DELORD; Julie ALLEMAND-SOURRIEU; Frederique RETORNAZ; Caroline CHARPIN; Thomas Gonzales; Herve PEGLIASCO; Jerome ALLARDET-SERVENT,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249254,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249254,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
105,Early Analysis of a potential link between viral load and the N501Y mutation in the SARS-COV-2 spike protein,"A new variant of SARS-CoV-2 has emerged which is increasing in frequency, primarily in the South East of England (lineage B.1.1.7 (1); VUI-202012/01). One potential hypothesis is that infection with the new variant results in higher viral loads, which in turn may make the virus more transmissible. We found higher (sequence derived) viral loads in samples from individuals infected with the new variant with median inferred viral loads were three-fold higher in individuals with the new variant. Most of the new variants were sampled in Kent and Greater London. We observed higher viral loads in Kent compared to Greater London for both the new variant and other circulating lineages. Outside Greater London, the variant has higher viral loads, whereas within Greater London, the new variant does not have significantly higher viral loads compared to other circulating lineages. Higher variant viral loads outside Greater London could be due to demographic effects, such as a faster variant growth rate compared to other lineages or concentration in particular age-groups. However, our analysis does not exclude a causal link between infection with the new variant and higher viral loads. This is a preliminary analysis and further work is needed to investigate any potential causal link between infection with this new variant and higher viral loads, and whether this results in higher transmissibility, severity of infection, or affects relative rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection

106,Bacterial superinfection pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure,"BackgroundSevere community-acquired pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 is a leading cause of death. Current guidelines recommend patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia receive empirical antibiotic therapy for suspected bacterial superinfection, but little evidence supports these recommendations.

MethodsWe obtained bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. We analyzed BAL samples with multiplex PCR and quantitative culture to determine the prevalence of superinfecting pathogens at the time of intubation and identify episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) over the course of mechanical ventilation. We compared antibiotic use with guideline-recommended care.

ResultsThe 179 ventilated patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia discharged from our hospital by June 30, 2020 were analyzed. 162 (90.5%) patients had at least one BAL procedure; 133 (74.3%) within 48 hours after intubation and 112 (62.6%) had at least one subsequent BAL during their hospitalization. A superinfecting pathogen was identified within 48 hours of intubation in 28/133 (21%) patients, most commonly methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species (21/28, 75%). BAL-based treatment reduced antibiotic use compared with guideline-recommended care. 72 patients (44.4%) developed at least one VAP episode. Only 15/72 (20.8%) of initial VAPs were attributable to multidrug-resistant pathogens. The incidence rate of VAP was 45.2/1000 ventilator days.

ConclusionsWith use of sensitive diagnostic tools, bacterial superinfection at the time of intubation is infrequent in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Treatment based on current guidelines would result in substantial antibiotic overuse. The incidence rate of VAP in ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are higher than historically reported.",Chiagozie O. Pickens; Catherine A. Gao; Michael J. Cuttica; Sean B.

107,Increased peripheral blood neutrophil activation phenotypes and NETosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundIncreased inflammation is a hallmark of COVID-19, with pulmonary and systemic inflammation identified in multiple cohorts of patients. Definitive cellular and molecular pathways driving severe forms of this disease remain uncertain. Neutrophils, the most numerous leukocytes in blood circulation, can contribute to immunopathology in infections, inflammatory diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Changes in multiple neutrophil functions and circulating cytokine levels over time during COVID-19 may help define disease severity and guide care and decision making.

MethodsBlood was obtained serially from critically ill COVID-19 patients for 11 days. Neutrophil oxidative burst, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), phagocytosis and cytokine levels were assessed ex vivo. Lung tissue was obtained immediately post-mortem for immunostaining.

ResultsElevations in neutrophil-associated cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, and general inflammatory cytokines IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10 and TNF, were identified in COVID-19 plasma both at the first measurement and at multiple timepoints across hospitalization (p < 0.0001). Neutrophils had exaggerated oxidative burst (p < 0.0001), NETosis (p < 0.0001) and phagocytosis (p < 0.0001) relative to controls. Increased NETosis correlated with both leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Neutrophils and NETs were identified within airways and alveoli in the lung parenchyma of 40% of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs. While elevations in IL-8 and ANC correlated to COVID-19 disease severity, plasma IL-8 levels alone correlated with death.

ConclusionsCirculating neutrophils in COVID-19 exhibit an activated phenotype with increased oxidative burst, NETosis and phagocytosis. Readily accessible and dynamic, plasma IL-8 and circulating neutrophil function may be potential COVID-19 disease biomarkers.",Jorge A. Masso-Silva PhD; Alexander Moshensky BS; Michael T. Y.

108,Elevated Angiopoietin-2 inhibits thrombomodulin-mediated anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Several studies suggest that hypercoagulation and endothelial dysfunction play central roles in severe forms of COVID-19. Here, we hypothesized that the high levels of the inflammatory cytokine Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) reported in hospitalized COVID-19 patients might promote hypercoagulation through ANGPT2 binding to thrombomodulin with resulting inhibition of thrombin/thrombomodulin-mediated physiological anticoagulation. We therefore investigated plasma samples taken at two timepoints from 20 critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care regarding ANGPT2 levels and coagulation markers in comparison with 20 healthy blood donors. We found that ANGPT2 levels were increased in the COVID-19 patients in correlation with disease severity, hypercoagulation, and mortality. To test causality, we administered ANGPT2 to wildtype mice and found that it shortened bleeding time in a tail injury model. In further support of a role for ANGPT2 in physiological coagulation, bleeding time was increased in endothelial-specific Angpt2 knockout mice. Using in vitro assays, we found that ANGPT2 inhibited thrombomodulin-mediated anticoagulation and protein C activation in human donor plasma. Our data reveal a novel mechanism for ANGPT2 in hypercoagulation and suggest that Angiopoietin-2 inhibition may be tested in the treatment of hypercoagulation in severe COVID-19, as well as in certain other conditions, including sepsis.",Michael Hultstrom; Karin Fromell; Anders Larsson; Susan E Quaggin; Christer Betsholtz; Robert Frithiof; Miklos Lipcsey; Marie Jeansson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249429,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249429,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
109,The impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on those with lifelong conditions: a case study of congenital heart disease,"ObjectivesGlobally, health care systems have been stretched to the limit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant changes have had to be made to the way in which non-COVID-19 related care has been delivered. Our objective was to understand, from the perspective of patients with a chronic, life-long condition (congenital heart disease, CHD) and their parents/carers, the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of care, how changes were communicated and whether health care providers should do anything differently in a subsequent wave of COVID-19 infections.

Design and settingA series of asynchronous discussion forums set up and moderated by three patient charities via their Facebook pages.

ParticipantsPatients with CHD and parents/carers of patients with CHD.

Main outcome measuresQualitative responses to questions posted on the discussion forums.

ResultsThe forums ran over a 6-week period and involved 111 participants. Following thematic analysis of the transcripts, we identified three themes and ten subthemes related to individual condition-related factors, patient-related factors and health professional/centre factors that may have influenced how patients and parents/carers experienced changes to service delivery as a result of COVID-19.

ConclusionsOur findings, whilst collected in relation to patients with CHD, are not necessarily specific to this population and we believe reflect the experiences of many thousands of people with life-long conditions in the UK. Drawing on what participants told us in the discussion forums, we have developed recommendations related to communication, service delivery and support during the pandemic that would, we think, improve patients experience of care and, potentially, their outcomes. Although the data were collected specifically in relation to COVID-19, a number of these recommendations are relevant to the wider delivery of care to patients with chronic underlying health conditions and reflect principles of good communication and service delivery.",Jo Wray; Christina Pagel; Adrian H Chester; Fiona Kennedy; Sonya Crowe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249447,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249447,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
110,Mortality of Diabetes-related Acute Metabolic Emergencies in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"PurposeLittle is known on the mortality rate in COVID-19 related acute metabolic emergencies, namely diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), combined DKA/HHS, and euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA).

MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted using EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar from January 1, 2020 to January 9, 2021 to identify all case report series, cross-sectional studies, and meta-analyses of case reports describing mortality rate in DKA, HHS, and EDKA, in COVID-19 patients. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for case reports was used for quality assessment.

ResultsFrom 313 identified publications, 4 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. A systematic review and meta-analysis with subgroup analyses examined mortality rate in a total of 152 COVID-19 patients who had developed DKA, HHS, combined DKA/HHS, or EDKA. Combined mortality rate and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using random effects model. The study was registered to PROSPERO database (ID: 230737).

ResultsCombined mortality rate was found to be 27.1% [95% CI: 11.2-46.9%].

111,"Epidemiology of the early COVID-19 epidemic in Orange County, California: comparison of predictors of test positivity, mortality, and seropositivity","COVID-19 is one of the largest public health emergencies in modern history. Here we present a detailed analysis from a large population center in Southern California (Orange County, population of 3.2 million) to understand heterogeneity in risks of infection, test positivity, and death. We used a combination of datasets, including a population-representative seroprevalence survey, to assess the true burden of disease as well as COVID-19 testing intensity, test positivity, and mortality. In the first month of the local epidemic, case incidence clustered in high income areas. This pattern quickly shifted, with cases next clustering in much higher rates in the north-central area which has a lower socio-economic status. Since April, a concentration of reported cases, test positivity, testing intensity, and seropositivity in a north-central area persisted. At the individual level, several factors (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, zip codes with low educational attainment) strongly affected risk of seropositivity and death.",Daniel M.

112,Evaluating the effects of re-opening plans on dynamics of COVID-19 in SP,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in early March 2020. In Brazil, Sao Paulo is the most affected state, comprising about 20% of the countrys cases. With no vaccine available to date, distancing measures have been taken to reduce virus transmission. To reduce the pandemics effect on the economy, the government of Sao Paulo has proposed a plan consisting of five phases of the gradual re-opening of activities. In this context, we have developed a mathematical model to simulate the gradual re-opening plan on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, in the city of Sao Paulo. The model shows that a precipitous reopening can cause a higher peak of the disease, which may compromise the local health system. Waiting for the reduction in the incidence of infected individuals for at least 15 days to phase transition is the most efficient strategy compared to the fixed-period scenario at each phase of the re-opening plan.",Felipe Alves Rubio; Thomas Nogueira Vilches,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249809,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249809,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
113,Impact of COVID-19 on Care-Home Mortality and Life Expectancy in Scotland,"IntroductionCOVID-19 deaths are commoner among care-home residents, but the mortality burden has not been quantified.

MethodsCare-home residency was identified via a national primary care registration database linked to national mortality data. Life expectancy was estimated using Makeham-Gompertz models, to (i) describe yearly life expectancy from Nov 2015 to Oct 2020 (ii) compare life expectancy (during 2016-2018) between care-home residents and the wider Scottish population and (iii) apply care-home life expectancy estimates to COVID-19 death counts to estimate years of life lost (YLL).

ResultsAmong care-home residents, life expectancy in 2015/16 to 2019/20 ranged from 2.7 to 2.3 years for women and 2.3 to 1.8 years for men. Life expectancy was lowest in 2019/20. Age-sex specific life expectancy in 2016-2018 in care-home residents was lower than in the Scottish population (10 and 2.5 years in those aged 70 and 90 respectively). Rather than using national life tables, applying care-home specific life expectancies to COVID-19 deaths yields, mean YLLs for care-home residents were 2.6 and 2.2 for women and men respectively, with total care-home resident YLLs of 3,560 years in women and 2,046 years in men. In people aged over-70, approximately half of deaths and a quarter of YLL attributed to COVID-19 were accounted for by the 5% of over-70s who were care-home residents.

ConclusionPrioritising care-home residents for vaccination is justified not only in terms of total deaths, but also in terms of years of life lost.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed to 1st December 2020, with the terms (""nursing home"" OR ""care-home"" OR ""long-term care"" OR ""residential care"") AND (""mortality"" OR ""life expectancy"" OR ""length of stay""). We also searched for studies specific to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those living in care-homes. We restricted our search to publications in English. Usual care-home life expectancy, in a UK context, has not previously been defined. One systematic review of length of stay was identified, which found significant heterogeneity in factors and associations. The impact of COVID-19 on excess mortality among care-home residents was noted, but the impact on life expectancy was not reported. Studies evaluating life expectancy among older people in the COVID-19 pandemic have not taken account of residency in their estimates.

Added value of this studyUsing Scottish national representative linked data we describe the usual life expectancy of older adults (aged [&ge;]70 years) living in care-homes, compared to older people living elsewhere. Deaths among care-home residents account for a considerable proportion of all mortality in older adults, around 19% for men and 30% for women. Life expectancy in care-home residents during the pandemic fell by almost 6 months, from 2.7 to 2.3 years in men and 2.1 to 1.8 years in women. In total, over 5,600 Years of Life were Lost (YLL) by care-home residents in Scotland who died with COVID-19. Around half of COVID-19 deaths and a quarter of YLL in those aged 70 years and over occurred among care-home residents. During the COVID-19 pandemic a smaller proportion of deaths among care-home residents occurred in hospitals.

Implications of all the available evidencePrioritising the 5% of older adults who are care-home residents for vaccination against COVID-19 is justified both in terms of total deaths and total years of life lost. Individual and societal planning for care needs in older age relies on understanding usual care-home life expectancy and patterns of mortality. Understanding life expectancy may help clinicians, residents and their families make decisions about their health care, facilitating more informed discussions around their priorities and wishes. Population-wide estimates of YLL and burden of disease should take account of residency status, given the significant differences between life expectancy of those living in care-homes from their peers in other settings.",Jennifer Kirsty Burton; Martin Reid; Ciara Gribben; David Caldwell; David N Clark; Peter Hanlon; Terence J Quinn; Colin Fischbacher; Peter Knight; Bruce Guthrie; David McAllister,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249871,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249871,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

Compared with existing models, the model successfully reproduces similar multiple observed outputs such as infected and recovered patients in Italy by July 2020. In doing so, the system dynamics model captures the roles of undocumented cases on the Italian COVID-19 flow. The model also considers two types of measures including behavioral measures and lockdown measures as they are embedded in the model. It is hoped that the model can enhance our understanding of the roles of undocumented cases, so-called asymptomatic cases, and the efficacy of two different policies on the COVID-19 flow. This study concludes that the first policy is important once the number of infected cases is relatively low. However, once the number of infected cases is very high so the society cannot identify infected and disinfected people, the second policy must be applied soon. It is thus this study suggests that relaxed lockdowns lead the second wave of the COVID-19 around the world.",Muhamad Khairulbahri,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249273,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249273,2021-01-14,2021-01-14,,True
117,"Magnitude, change over time, demographic characteristics and geographic distribution of excess deaths among nursing home residents during the first wave of COVID-19 in France: a nationwide cohort study","ImportanceNursing home (NH) residents are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lethality. However, excess deaths in this population have rarely been documented.

ObjectivesThe primary objective was to assess the number of excess deaths among NH residents during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. The secondary objectives were to determine the number of excess deaths as a proportion of the total excess deaths in the general population and determine whether a harvesting effect was present.

DesignWe studied a cohort of 494,753 adults (as of March 1st, 2020) aged 60 and over in 6,515 NHs in mainland France. This cohort was exposed to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 1st to May 31st, 2020) and was compared with the corresponding, reference cohorts from 2014 to 2019 (using data from the French National Health Data System).

Main outcome and measuresThe main outcome was all-cause death. Weekly excess deaths and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated.

ResultThere were 13,505 excess deaths among NH residents. Mortality increased by 43% (SMR: 1.43). The mortality excess was higher among males than among females (SMR: 1.51 and 1.38, respectively) and decreased with age (SMRs in females: 1.61 in the 60-74 age group, 1.58 for 75-84, 1.41 for 85-94, and 1.31 for 95 or over; Males: SMRs: 1.59 for 60-74, 1.69 for 75-84, 1.47 for 85-94, and 1.41 for 95 or over). We did not observe a harvesting effect (up until August 30th, 2020). By extrapolating to all NH residents nationally (N=570,003), the latter accounted for 51% of the total excess deaths in the general population (N=15,114 out of 29,563).

ConclusionNH residents accounted for about half of the total excess deaths in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The excess death rate was higher among males than females and among younger residents than among older residents. We did not observe a harvesting effect. A real-time mortality surveillance system and the identification of individual and environmental risk factors might help to design the future model of care for older dependent adults.

118,Occupational and environmental exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in and around infected mink farms,"Unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 infections in farmed minks raised immediate concerns regarding human health which initiated intensive environmental investigations. Air sampling was performed in infected mink farms, at farm premises and at residential sites. A range of other environmental samples were collected from minks housing units including bedding material. Inside the farms, high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found in airborne dust, on surfaces, and on various other environmental matrices. This warns for occupational exposure which was substantiated by considerable SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in personal air samples. Dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 to outdoor air was found to be limited and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in air samples collected beyond farm premises, implying a negligible environmental exposure risk for nearby communities.

Little is known about neutralizing Abs binding to epitopes outside the RBD and their contribution to protection.

We define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate effector functions, and protect Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the 501Y.V2 and B.1.1.7 lineages, harbor frequent mutations localized in the NTD supersite suggesting ongoing selective pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs to protective immunity.",Matthew McCallum; Anna De Marco; Florian Lempp; M.

120,"A highly thermotolerant, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain derivative elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies","The Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We fused our previously described, highly thermotolerant glycan engineered monomeric RBD to a heterologous non-immunogenic trimerization domain derived from cartilage matrix protein. The protein was expressed at a good yield of [~]80-100 mg/liter in Expi293 cells, as well as in both CHO and HEK293 stable cell lines. The designed trimeric RBD was observed to form homogeneous disulfide-linked trimers. When lyophilized, the trimer possessed remarkable functional stability to transient thermal stress of upto 100 {degrees}C and was stable to long term storage of over 4 weeks at 37 {degrees}C. Two immunizations with an AddaVax adjuvanted formulation elicited antibodies with high endpoint neutralizing titers against replicative virus with geometric mean titers of [~]1114 and 1940 in guinea pigs and mice respectively. In pseudoviral assays, corresponding titers were [~]3600 and [~]16050, while the corresponding value for human convalescent sera was 137. Similar results were obtained with an Alhydrogel, CpG combination adjuvant. The same immunogen was expressed in Pichia pastoris, but this formed high molecular weight aggregates and elicited much lower ACE2 competing antibodies than mammalian cell expressed protein. The excellent thermotolerance, high yield, and robust immunogenicity of such trimeric RBD immunogens suggest that they are a promising modality to combat COVID-19.

ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The viral surface exposed Spike glycoprotein is the target of neutralizing antibodies of which a major fraction targets the receptor binding domain (RBD). Thus RBD derived immunogens are attractive vaccine candidates. Monomeric, mammalian cell expressed RBD protein elicits low to moderate titers of neutralizing antibodies. We designed a highly expressed, trimeric RBD derivative with a non-immunogenic trimerization domain. In guinea pigs and mice respectively, this derivative induces 20-300 fold higher neutralizing antibody titers relative to convalescent human sera, while remaining conformationally intact after incubation for over four weeks at 37 {degrees}C and for ninety minutes at 100 {degrees}C when lyophilized. Such trimeric RBD formulations should not require a cold chain. Additionally, the high titers of neutralizing antibodies should buffer against viral sequence variation.

121,Susceptibility of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to SARS-CoV-2,"The origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing the global coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains a mystery. Current evidence suggests a likely spillover into humans from an animal reservoir. Understanding the host range and identifying animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to elucidate the origin of the virus and the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Here we demonstrated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an animal species in which the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - the SARS-CoV-2 receptor - shares a high degree of similarity to humans, are highly susceptible to infection. Intranasal inoculation of deer fawns with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in established subclinical viral infection and shedding of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Notably, infected animals transmitted the virus to non-inoculated contact deer. Viral RNA was detected in multiple tissues 21 days post-inoculation (pi). All inoculated and indirect contact animals seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies as early as day 7 pi. The work provides important insights into the animal host range of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies white-tailed deer as a susceptible wild animal species to the virus.

IMPORTANCEGiven the presumed zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, the human-animal-environment interface of COVID-19 pandemic is an area of great scientific and public- and animal-health interest. Identification of animal species that are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate the potential origin of the virus, identify potential reservoirs or intermediate hosts, and define the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Additionally, it may also provide information and help to prevent potential reverse zoonosis that could lead to the establishment of a new wildlife hosts. Our data show that upon intranasal inoculation, white-tailed deer became subclinically infected and shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and feces. Importantly, indirect contact animals were infected and shed infectious virus, indicating efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission from inoculated animals. These findings support the inclusion of wild cervid species in investigations conducted to assess potential reservoirs or sources of SARS-CoV-2 of infection.",Mitchell V Palmer; Mathias Martins; Shollie Falkenberg; Alexandra C Buckley; Leonardo C Caserta; Patrick K.

122,"The lethal triad: SARS-CoV-2 Spike, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Mutations in host and pathogen may affect the course of pandemic.","Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified rapidly after the beginning of pandemic. One of them, involving the spike protein and called D614G, represents a substantial percentage of currently isolated strains. While research on this variant was ongoing worldwide, on December 20th 2020 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported a Threat Assessment Brief describing the emergence of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, named B.1.1.7, harboring multiple mutations mostly affecting the Spike protein. This viral variant has been recently associated with a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in South East England, with alarming implications for future virus transmission rates. Specifically, of the nine amino acid replacements that characterize the Spike in the emerging variant, four are found in the region between the Fusion Peptide and the RBD domain (namely the already known D614G, together with A570D, P681H, T716I), and one, N501Y, is found in the Spike Receptor Binding Domain - Receptor Binding Motif (RBD-RBM). In this study, by using in silico biology, we provide evidence that these amino acid replacements have dramatic effects on the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 Spike and the host ACE2 receptor or TMPRSS2, the protease that induces the fusogenic activity of Spike. Mostly, we show that these effects are strongly dependent on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphism, suggesting that dynamics of pandemics are strongly influenced not only by virus variation but also by host genetic background.",Matteo Calcagnile; Patricia Forgez; Pietro Alifano; Marco Alifano,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426365,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426365,2021-01-14,2021-01-14,,False

In this study, we monitored mutational events in the SARS-CoV-2 genome through whole genome sequencing. The samples (n=48) were collected from the hot spot regions of the metropolitan city Karachi, Pakistan during the four months (May 2020 to August 2020) of first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data analysis highlighted 122 mutations, including 120 single nucleotide variations (SNV), and 2 deletions. Among the 122 mutations, there were 71 singletons, and 51 recurrent mutations. A total of 16 mutations, including 5 nonsynonymous mutations, were detected in spike protein. Notably, the spike protein missense mutation D614G was observed in 31 genomes. The phylogenetic analysis revealed majority of the genomes (36) classified as B lineage, where 2 genomes were from B.6 lineage, 5 genomes from B.1 ancestral lineage and remaining from B.1 sub-lineages. It was noteworthy that three clusters of B.1 sub-lineages were observed, including B.1.36 lineage (10 genomes), B.1.160 lineage (11 genomes), and B.1.255 lineage (5 genomes), which represent independent events of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the city. The sub-lineage B.1.36 had higher representation from the Asian countries and the UK, B.1.160 correspond to the European countries with highest representation from the UK, Denmark, and lesser representation from India, Saudi Arabia, France and Switzerland, and the third sub-lineage (B.1.255) correspond to the USA.

Plasmid DNA vaccines are one of the most remarkable vaccines that can be developed in a short term. pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co, which is a plasmid DNA vaccine, was designed to express severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The produced antibodies lead to Immunoreactions against S protein, anti-receptor-binding-domain, and neutralizing action of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co, as confirmed in a previous study. To promote the efficacy of the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine, a pyro-drive jet injector (PJI) was employed. PJI is an injection device that can adjust the injection pressure depending on various target tissues. Intradermally-adjusted PJI demonstrated that pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine injection caused a strong production of anti-S protein antibodies, triggered immunoreactions and neutralizing actions against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, a high dose of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection via PJI did not cause any serious disorders in the rat model. Finally, virus infection challenge in mice, confirmed that intradermally immunized (via PJI) mice were potently protected from COVID-19 infection.

The N protein LKR region K203, R204 of wild type (SARS-CoVs) and (SARS-CoV-2) observed HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:21, but mutant SARS-CoV-2 observed HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-A*68:01. Expression of HLA-A genotypes associated with the mutant strain occurred more frequently in all populations studied.

126,Mutation rates and selection on synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented response from the sequencing community. Leveraging the sequence data from more than 140,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we study mutation rates and selective pressures affecting the virus. Understanding the processes and effects of mutation and selection has profound implications for the study of viral evolution, for vaccine design, and for the tracking of viral spread. We highlight and address some common genome sequence analysis pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate inference of mutation rates and selection, such as ignoring skews in the genetic code, not accounting for recurrent mutations, and assuming evolutionary equilibrium. We find that two particular mutation rates, G[-&gt;]U and C[-&gt;]U, are similarly elevated and considerably higher than all other mutation rates, causing the majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and are possibly the result of APOBEC and ROS activity. These mutations also tend to occur many times at the same genome positions along the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (i.e., they are very homoplasic). We observe an effect of genomic context on mutation rates, but the effect of the context is overall limited. While previous studies have suggested selection acting to decrease U content at synonymous sites, we bring forward evidence suggesting the opposite.",Nicola De Maio; Conor R Walker; Yatish Turakhia; Robert Lanfear; Russell Corbett-Detig; Nick Goldman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426705,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426705,2021-01-14,2021-01-14,,False
127,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein arrested in the closed state induces potent neutralizing responses,"The majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in use or in advanced clinical development are based on the viral spike protein (S) as their immunogen. S is present on virions as pre-fusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described that act against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies will depend upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving, circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, while avoiding the risk of antibody dependent enhancement as observed with other Coronavirus vaccines. Here we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer that is arrested in the closed state to prevent exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with the receptor. We compared this with a range of other modified S protein constructs, including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induce a long-lived, strongly neutralizing antibody response as well as T-cell responses. Notably, the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralising responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different, but equally potent, virus-inhibiting immune responses than open spikes, and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Together with their improved stability and storage properties we suggest that closed spikes may be a valuable component of refined, next-generation vaccines.",George W Carnell; Katarzyna A Ciazynska; David A Wells; Xiaoli Xiong; Ernest T Aguinam; Stephen H McLaughlin; Donna Mallery; Leo C James; Jonathan Luke Heeney; John A.

128,The National COVID Cohort Collaborative: Clinical Characterization and Early Severity Prediction,"BackgroundThe majority of U.S. reports of COVID-19 clinical characteristics, disease course, and treatments are from single health systems or focused on one domain. Here we report the creation of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a centralized, harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record repository that is the largest, most representative U.S. cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls to date. This multi-center dataset supports robust evidence-based development of predictive and diagnostic tools and informs critical care and policy.

Methods and FindingsIn a retrospective cohort study of 1,926,526 patients from 34 medical centers nationwide, we stratified patients using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographics; we then evaluated differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression. We established vital signs and laboratory values among COVID-19 patients with different severities, providing the foundation for predictive analytics. The cohort included 174,568 adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PCR >99% or antigen <1%) as well as 1,133,848 adult patients that served as lab-negative controls. Among 32,472 hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March/April 2020 to 8.6% in September/October 2020 (p = 0.002 monthly trend). In a multivariable logistic regression model, age, male sex, liver disease, dementia, African-American and Asian race, and obesity were independently associated with higher clinical severity. To demonstrate the utility of the N3C cohort for analytics, we used machine learning (ML) to predict clinical severity and risk factors over time. Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, we predicted a severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) using random forest and XGBoost models (AUROC 0.86 and 0.87 respectively) that were stable over time. The most powerful predictors in these models are patient age and widely available vital sign and laboratory values. The established expected trajectories for many vital signs and laboratory values among patients with different clinical severities validates observations from smaller studies, and provides comprehensive insight into COVID-19 characterization in U.S. patients.

ConclusionsThis is the first description of an ongoing longitudinal observational study of patients seen in diverse clinical settings and geographical regions and is the largest COVID-19 cohort in the United States. Such data are the foundation for ML models that can be the basis for generalizable clinical decision support tools. The N3C Data Enclave is unique in providing transparent, reproducible, easily shared, versioned, and fully auditable data and analytic provenance for national-scale patient-level EHR data. The N3C is built for intensive ML analyses by academic, industry, and citizen scientists internationally. Many observational correlations can inform trial designs and care guidelines for this new disease.",Tellen D. Bennett; Richard A. Moffitt; Janos G. Hajagos; Benjamin Amor; Adit Anand; Mark M.

Serum from patients of varying ages and clinical severity were collected and used to probe a novel multi-coronavirus protein microarray containing SARS-CoV-2 proteins and overlapping protein fragments of varying length as well as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 proteins. IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses to specific epitopes within the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane proteins (M) were higher in older adult patients. Moreover, the older age group displayed more consistent correlations of antibody reactivity with systemic cytokine and chemokine responses when compared to the younger adult group. A subset of patients, however, had little or no response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and disproportionately severe clinical outcomes.

130,The Relationship between Democracy embracement and COVID-19 reported casualties worldwide,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 toll of cases and deaths followed an uneven pattern across the world. The literature has partly explained the observed discrepancy between the different countries by country-specific and systemic patterns worldwide. In this study, we propose an additional explanation that the magnitude of COVID-19 toll reported to the WHO could be influenced by the level of free speech and Democracy in the reporting countries.

MethodsWe constructed a longitudinal dataset including the daily COVID-19 count of cases and deaths worldwide and each countrys respective score on the Freedom in the World index. We applied two Generalized Estimating Equation models to investigate if a countrys reported toll count of COVID-19 cases and deaths is related to that countrys freedom level. We controlled for factors identified in the current literature to affect the pandemics spread.

ResultsA countrys score on the Freedom In the World Index was associated with its reported COVID-19 cases count (57028.43, 95% CI 985.3619 - 113071.5, P= 0.0461) and deaths count (3473.273, 95% CI1217.12-5729.42, P=.002). Also, despite having almost equal shares of the worlds population, countries at the bottom category of the Freedom index reported 21% and 11% of the COVID-19 toll cases and death counts reported by countries of highest scores on the index, respectively.

ConclusionsThe known magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemics morbidity and mortality appears to be as transparent as the reporting countries uphold free speech and Democracy.

131,Model-based cellular kinetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: different immune response modes and treatment strategies,"Increasing number in global COVID-19 cases demands for mathematical model to analyze the interaction between the virus dynamics and the response of innate and adaptive immunity. Here, based on the assumption of a weak and delayed response of the innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we constructed a mathematical model to describe the dynamic processes of immune system. Integrating theoretical results with clinical COVID-19 patients data, we classified the COVID-19 development processes into three typical modes of immune responses, correlated with the clinical classification of mild & moderate, severe and critical patients. We found that the immune efficacy (the ability of host to clear virus and kill infected cells) and the lymphocyte supply (the abundance and pool of naive T and B cell) play important roles in the dynamic process and determine the clinical outcome, especially for the severe and critical patients. Furthermore, we put forward possible treatment strategies for the three typical modes of immune response. We hope our results can help to understand the dynamical mechanism of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to be useful for the treatment strategies and vaccine design.",Zhengqing Zhou; Ziheng Zhao; Shuyu Shi; Jianghua Wu; Dianjie Li; Jianwei Li; Jingpeng Zhang; Ke Gui; Yu Zhang; Heng Mei; Yu Hu; Qi Ouyang; Fangting Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249562,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249562,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
132,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen from serum can aid in timing of COVID-19 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in respiratory samples for weeks or even months after onset of COVID-19 disease. Therefore, one of the diagnostic challenges of PCR positive cases is differentiating between acute COVID-19 disease and convalescent phase. Recently, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen in serum samples of COVID-19 patients was published [Le Hingrat et al. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen in blood during acute COVID-19 provides a sensitive new marker and new testing alternatives, Clinical Microbiology and Infection, 2020].

Our study aimed to characterize the analytical specificity and sensitivity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Salocor SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Quantitative Assay Kit(C) (Salofa Ltd, Salo, Finland)) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in serum, and to characterize the kinetics of antigenemia. The evaluation material included a negative serum panel of 155 samples, and 126 serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19.

The specificity of the Salocor SARS-CoV-2 serum N antigen test was 98.0%. In comparison with simultaneous positive PCR from upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens, the test sensitivity was 91.7%. In a serum panel in which the earliest serum sample was collected two days before the collection of positive URT specimen, and the latest 48 days after (median 1 day post URT sample collection), the serum N antigen test sensitivity was 94% within 14 days post onset of symptoms. The antigenemia resolved approximately two weeks after the onset of disease and diagnostic PCR.

The combination of simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody testing appeared to provide useful information for the timing of COVID-19. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 N-antigenemia may be used as a diagnostic marker in acute COVID-19.",Maarit J Ahava; Satu Kurkela; Suvi Kuivanen; Maija Lappalainen; Hanna Jarva; Anne J Jaaskelainen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20248771,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20248771,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
133,A national retrospective cohort study of mechanical ventilator availability and its association with mortality risk in intensive care patients with COVID-19,"ObjectivesTo determine if there is an association between survival rates in intensive care units (ICU) and occupancy of the unit on the day of admission.

DesignNational retrospective observational cohort study spanning the first wave of the Englands COVID-19 pandemic.

Setting114 hospital trusts (groups of hospitals functioning as single operational units).

Participants4,032 adults admitted to an ICU in England between 2nd April and 1st June, 2020, with presumed or confirmed COVID-19, for whom data was submitted to the national surveillance programme and met study inclusion criteria.

InterventionsN/A

Main Outcomes and MeasuresA Bayesian hierarchical approach was used to model the association between hospital trust level (mechanical ventilation compatible) bed occupancy, and in-hospital all-cause mortality. Results were adjusted for unit characteristics (pre-pandemic size), individual patient-level demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, time-to-ICU admission), and recorded chronic comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, respiratory disease, liver disease, heart disease, hypertension, immunosuppression, neurological disease, renal disease).

Results79,793 patient-days were observed, with a mortality rate of 19.4 per 1,000 patient days. Adjusting for patient-level factors, mortality was higher for admissions during periods of high occupancy (>85% occupancy versus the baseline of 45 to 85%) [OR 1.19 (95% posterior credible interval (PCI): 1.00 to 1.44)]. In contrast, mortality was decreased for admissions during periods of low occupancy (<45% relative to the baseline) [OR 0.75 (95% PCI: 0.62 to 0.89)].

Conclusion and RelevanceIncreasing occupancy of beds compatible with mechanical ventilation, a proxy for operational strain, is associated with a higher mortality risk for individuals admitted to ICU. Public health interventions (such as expeditious vaccination programmes and non-pharmaceutical interventions) to control both incidence and prevalence of COVID-19, and therefore keep ICU occupancy low in the context of the pandemic, are necessary to mitigate the impact of this type of resource saturation.

O_TEXTBOXSummary Box

What is already known on this topicPre-pandemic, higher occupancy of intensive care units was shown to be associated with increased mortality risk. However, there is limited data on the extent to which occupancy levels impacted patient outcomes during the first wave of COVID-19, especially in light of the mobilisation of significant additional resources. A recent study from Belgium reported a 42% higher mortality during periods of ICU surge capacity deployment, although in the analysis surge capacity was evaluated only as a binary variable. Although, this contradicts earlier results from smaller studies in Australia and Wales, where no association between ICU occupancy and mortality was identified.

What this study addsThe results of this study suggest that survival rates for patients with COVID-19 in intensive care settings appears to deteriorate as the occupancy of (surge capacity) beds compatible with mechanical ventilation (a proxy for operational pressure), increases. Moreover, this risk doesnt occur above a specific threshold, but rather appears linear; whereby going from 0% occupancy to 100% occupancy increases risk of mortality by 92% (after adjusting for relevant individual-level factors). Furthermore, risk of mortality based on occupancy on the date of recorded outcome is even higher; OR 4.74 (95% posterior credible interval: 3.54 - 6.34). As such, this national-level cohort study of England provides compelling evidence for a relationship between occupancy and critical care mortality, and highlights the needs for decisive action to control the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19.

134,Deep RNA Sequencing of Intensive Care Unit Patients with COVID-19,"PurposeCOVID-19 has impacted millions of patients across the world. Molecular testing occurring now identifies the presence of the virus at the sampling site: nasopharynx, nares, or oral cavity. RNA sequencing has the potential to establish both the presence of the virus and define the hosts response in COVID-19.

MethodsSingle center, prospective study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit where deep RNA sequencing (>100 million reads) of peripheral blood with computational biology analysis was done. All patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Clinical data was prospectively collected.

ResultsWe enrolled fifteen patients at a single hospital. Patients were critically ill with a mortality of 47% and 67% were on a ventilator. All the patients had the SARS-CoV-2 RNA identified in the blood in addition to RNA from other viruses, bacteria, and archaea. The expression of many immune modulating genes, including PD-L1 and PD-L2, were significantly different in patients who died from COVID-19. Some proteins were influenced by alternative transcription and splicing events, as seen in HLA-C, HLA-E, NRP1 and NRP2. Entropy calculated from alternative RNA splicing and transcription start/end predicted mortality in these patients.

ConclusionsCurrent upper respiratory tract testing for COVID-19 only determines if the virus is present. Deep RNA sequencing with appropriate computational biology may provide important prognostic information and point to therapeutic foci to be precisely targeted in future studies.

Take Home MessageDeep RNA sequencing provides a novel diagnostic tool for critically ill patients. Among ICU patients with COVID-19, RNA sequencings can identify gene expression, pathogens (including SARS-CoV-2), and can predict mortality.

In this study we use a network Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to show under which circumstances it is in a countrys self-interest to ensure other countries can also obtain a COVID-19 vaccine rather than focusing only on vaccination of their own residents. In particular, we focus our analysis on the USs decision and estimate the internal burden of COVID-19 disease under different scenarios about vaccine cooperation. We show that in scenarios in which the US has reached the threshold for domestic herd immunity, the US may find it optimal to donate doses to other countries with lower vaccination coverage, as this would allow for a sharp reduction in the inflow of infected individuals from abroad.",Tiziano Rotesi; Paolo Pin; Maria Cucciniello; Amyn A.

136,The feasibility of targeted test-trace-isolate for the control of B.1.1.7,"The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 reportedly exhibits substantially higher transmission than the ancestral strain and may generate a major surge of cases before vaccines become widely available. As B.1.1.7 can be sensitively detected using the Thermo Fisher TaqPath S-gene RT-PCR test, contact tracing and isolation programs appear well-suited to slowing the spread of the new variant, which is still rare in most of the dozens of countries in which it has been identified. However, key determinants of outcomes such as data-sharing, trace success, and isolation compliance vary widely between regions, which may discourage public health agencies from explicitly redirecting existing contact tracers to contain B.1.1.7. Here we apply a branching-process model to estimate the effectiveness of implementing a B.1.1.7-focused testing, contact tracing, and isolation strategy with realistic levels of performance. Our model indicates that bidirectional contact tracing can substantially slow the spread of B.1.1.7 even in regions where a large fraction of the population refuses to cooperate with contact tracers or to abide by quarantine and isolation requests.",William J Bradshaw; Jonathan H Huggins; Alun L Lloyd; Kevin M Esvelt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249612,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249612,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
137,"Determining the optimal COVID-19 policy response using agent-based modelling linked to health and cost modelling: Case study for Victoria, Australia","BackgroundWe compared the health and economic consequences for the State of Victoria, Australia, of four COVID-19 strategies: aggressive and moderate elimination, tight suppression (aiming for 1 to 5 cases per million per day) and loose suppression (5 to 25 cases per million per day). The strategies shifted up and down through five levels of policy stringency based on the number of cases per day, for one year.

MethodsAn agent-based model (ABM) generated 100 runs of daily SARS-CoV-2 case numbers, that then fed into a proportional multistate lifetable to estimate health adjusted life years (HALYs) and costs. We used a net monetary benefit approach to estimate the optimal strategy.

FindingsAggressive elimination resulted in the highest percentage of days with the lowest level of restrictions (median 31.7%, 90% simulation interval 6.6% to 64.4%). However, days in hard lockdown were similar across all four strategies (medians 27.5% to 36.1%).

HALY losses (compared to a no-COVID-19 scenario) were similar for moderate elimination (286, 219 to 389) and moderate elimination (314, 228 to 413), and nearly eight and 40-times higher for tight and loose suppression. The median GDP loss was least for moderate elimination ($US41.7 billion, $29.0 to $63.6 billion), but there was substantial overlap in simulation intervals between the four strategies.

From a health system perspective aggressive elimination was optimal in 64% of simulations above a willingness to pay of $15,000 per HALY, followed by moderate elimination in 35% of simulations. Moderate elimination was optimal from a partial societal perspective in half the simulations followed by aggressive elimination in a quarter.

Shortening the pandemic duration to 6 months saw loose suppression become preferable under a partial societal perspective.

InterpretationFor this single high-income jurisdiction, elimination strategies were preferable over a 1-year pandemic duration.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere have been varying approaches across countries and jurisdictions as to how to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from elimination of community transmission (e.g. Australasia, Taiwan and other East Asian and Pacific Island countries) to loose suppression or mitigation that attempts to keep the case numbers within health services capacity (e.g. Sweden, USA, India, UK and some continental European countries). The best or optimal approach is unknown, and involves an invidious balancing of health, social and economic consequences of the pandemic. But it has become apparent that in high income countries using loose suppression that one still has to use lock-downs from time to time to keep case numbers within health service capacity, raising the question as to what is the best for the economy - attempting elimination, tight suppression or loose suppression?

One approach to integrating the health and economic consequences is cost effectiveness analysis, but to date such approaches have mainly been focused on SARS-CoV-2 treatments rather than societal intervention, and have not incorporated a counterfactual approach to compare the same jurisdiction across the many (stochastically varying) realizations for different policy options.

Added value of this studyThis study uses one high-income jurisdiction, the state of Victoria in Australia as it exited its second wave, to estimate the health and economic consequences of four policy options: aggressive and moderate elimination strategies, and tight and loose suppression strategies. The modeling is done in two steps: first, an agent-based model to simulate 100 possible trajectories of daily SARS-CoV-2 infections over one year for each of the four policy options; and second, an integrated epidemiological and economic model that estimates health and economic costs. Whilst there is considerable uncertainty in outcomes for all of the four policy options, the two elimination options are usually optimal from both a health system and a partial societal (health expenditure plus GDP cost) perspective. However, if the remaining duration of the pandemic is lessened from 1 year to half a year (as may be the case with vaccine roll-outs), loose suppression becomes more favorable - suggesting countries with already high infection rates  ride it out till vaccination coverage is adequate.",Professor Tony Blakely; Dr Jason Thompson; Dr Laxman Bablani; Patrick Andersen; Dr Driss Ait Ouakrim; Dr Natalie Carvalho; Patrick Abraham; Marie-Anne Boujaoude; Ameera Katar; Edifofon Akpan; Nick Wilson; Professor Mark Stevenson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249630,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249630,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
138,The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in England: key epidemiological drivers and impact of interventions,"We fitted a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in care homes and the community to regional surveillance data for England. Among control measures implemented, only national lockdown brought the reproduction number below 1 consistently; introduced one week earlier it could have reduced first wave deaths from 36,700 to 15,700 (95%CrI: 8,900-26,800). Improved clinical care reduced the infection fatality ratio from 1.25% (95%CrI: 1.18%-1.33%) to 0.77% (95%CrI: 0.71%-0.84%). The infection fatality ratio was higher in the elderly residing in care homes (35.9%, 95%CrI: 29.1%-43.4%) than those residing in the community (10.4%, 95%CrI: 9.1%-11.5%). England is still far from herd immunity, with regional cumulative infection incidence to 1st December 2020 between 4.8% (95%CrI: 4.4%-5.1%) and 15.4% (95%CrI: 14.9%-15.9%) of the population.

139,"Transmission dynamics and forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, March 20-November 11, 2020.","The ongoing coronavirus pandemic reached Mexico in late February 2020. Since then Mexico has observed a sustained elevation in the number of COVID-19 deaths. Mexicos delayed response to the COVID-19 pandemic until late March 2020 hastened the spread of the virus in the following months. However, the government followed a phased reopening of the country in June 2020 despite sustained virus transmission. In order to analyze the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, we systematically generate and compare the 30-day ahead forecasts of national mortality trends using various growth models in near real-time and compare forecasting performance with those derived using the COVID-19 model developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We also estimate and compare reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-2 based on methods that rely on both the genomic data as well as case incidence data to gauge the transmission potential of the virus. Moreover, we perform a spatial analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico by analyzing the shapes of COVID-19 growth rate curves at the state level, using techniques from functional data analysis. The early estimate of reproduction number indicates sustained disease transmission in the country with R[~]1.3. However, the estimate of R as of September 27, 2020 is [~]0.91 indicating a slowing down of the epidemic. The spatial analysis divides the Mexican states into four groups or clusters based on the growth rate curves, each with its distinct epidemic trajectory. Moreover, the sequential forecasts from the GLM and Richards model also indicate a sustained downward trend in the number of deaths for Mexico and Mexico City compared to the sub-epidemic and IHME model that outperformed the others and predict a more stable trajectory of COVID-19 deaths for the last three forecast periods.

Author summaryMexico has been confronting the COVID-19 epidemic since late February under a fragile health care system and economic recession. The country delayed the implementation of social distancing interventions resulting in continued virus transmission in the country and reopened its economy in June 2020. In order to investigate the unfolding of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico and Mexico City the authors utilize the mortality data to generate and compare thirteen sequentially generated short-term forecasts using phenomenological growth models. Moreover, the reproduction number is estimated from genomic and time series data to determine the transmission potential of the epidemic, and spatial analysis using case incidence data is conducted to identify the characteristic growth patterns of the epidemic in different Mexican states including rapid increase in the growth rate followed by a rapid decline and slow growth rate followed by a rapid rise and a rapid decline. The best performing models indicate a more sustained transmission of the pandemic in Mexico. The forecasts generated from the GLM and Richards growth model indicate towards a sustained decline in the number of deaths whereas the sub-epidemic model and IHME model point towards a stable epidemic trajectory for forecasting periods as of August 23, 2020.",Amna Tariq; Juan M.

140,Monitoring the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 from age-stratified hospitalisation and serological data,"BackgroundRegional monitoring of the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 is important to guide local management of the epidemic, but is difficult in the absence of regular nationwide serosurveys.

MethodsWe developed a method to reconstruct in real-time the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected from the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation and case data. We applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions.

FindingsWe estimate that 5.7% [5.1%-6.4%] of adults in metropolitan France had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 by May 2020. This proportion remained stable until August and increased to 12.6% [11.2%-14.3%] by the end of November. With 23.8% [21.2%-26.8%] infected in the Paris region compared to 4.0% [3.5% - 4.6%] in Brittany, regional variations remained large (Coefficient of Variation CV: 0.53) although less so than in May (CV: 0.74). The proportion infected was twice higher (17.6% [13.4%-22.7%]) in 20-49 y.o. than in 50+ y.o (8.0% [5.7% - 11.5%]). Forty percent [33.7% - 45.4%] of infections in adults were detected in June-August compared to 55.7% [48.7% - 63.1%] in September-November. Our method correctly predicted seroprevalence in 11 regions in which only hospitalisation data were used.

InterpretationIn the absence of contemporary serosurvey, our real-time monitoring indicates that the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 may be above 20% in some French regions.

142,Lessons learnt from the use of compartmental models over the COVID-19 induced lockdown in France,"BackgroundCompartmental models may help deciding on public health interventions. They were used during the first French COVID-19 lockdown to estimate the reproduction numbers and predict the number of hospital beds required. This study aimed to assess the ability of similar compartmental models to reflect equivalent epidemic dynamics.

MethodsThe study considered three compartmental models independently designed to describe the COVID-19 outbreak in France. These models were scrutinized and their compartments and parameters expressed in a common framework. The parameters were set alike in the three models according to values taken from the literature. The models were calibrated using a common maximum likelihood function and the same hospitalization data taken from two official public databases. The calibration procedure was repeated over three different periods to compare model abilities to (1) fit over the whole lockdown; (2) predict the course of the epidemic during the lockdown; and, (3) provide a set of profiles to forecast the hospitalization prevalence after the lockdown. The study considered national and regional coverages.

ResultsThe three models were all flexible enough to match hospitalization data during the lockdown, but the numbers of cases in the other compartments differed. The three models failed to predict reliably the number of hospitalizations after the fitting periods at national and regional levels. At the national scale, a refined calibration led to epidemic course profiles that reflected hospitalizations dynamics and corresponded to reproduction numbers coherent with official and literature estimates. This result could not be consistently obtained at the regional scale.

ConclusionNot all predictions were consistent between models. Even over the period used for calibration by fitting to hospitalization cases, important differences remained regarding the prevalence in the other compartments. Prevalence data are needed to further constrain the calibration and perform selection between still divergent models. This underlines strongly the need for repeated prevalence studies on representative samples, stratified by age and regions, which would undergo virological or serological tests.",Romain Gauchon; Nicolas Ponthus; Catherine Pothier; Christophe Rigotti; Vitaly Volpert; Stephane Derrode; Jean-Pierre Bertoglio; Alexis Bienvenue; Pierre-Olivier Goffard; Anne Eyraud-Loisel; Simon Pageaud; Jean Iwaz; Stephane Loisel; Pascal Roy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249565,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249565,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
143,"Rates and predictors of uptake of formal and informal mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic: an analysis of 26,740 adults in the UK in lockdown","PurposeThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put a great strain on peoples mental health. A growing number of studies have shown worsening mental health measures globally during the pandemic. However, there is a lack of empirical study on how people support their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine a number of formal and informal mental health supports. Further, it explored factors that might be associated with the use of different types mental health support.

MethodData from 26,740 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study were analysed between 13th April, 2020 and 3rd July, 2020. Data were analysed using logistic and Poisson regression models.

ResultsAbout 45% of people reported talking to friends or family members to support their mental health, 43% engaging in self-care activities, 20% taking medication, 9% speaking to mental health professionals, 8% talking to a GP or other health professional, and another 8% using helpline or online services. Gender, education, living status, loneliness, pre-existing mental health conditions, general depression and anxiety, coping and personality were found to be associated with the use of mental health support.

ConclusionWhile the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are inevitable, people can play an active role in managing their mental health. Understanding the patterns and predictors of various kinds of mental health support during the pandemic is crucial for future service planning and delivery through recognising potential barriers to mental health care faced by certain groups.",Feifei Bu; Hei Wan Mak; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249509,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249509,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
144,"Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Socio-demographics, Co-Morbidity and Past Racial Discrimination","ImportanceImmunization programs are only successful when there are high rates of acceptance and coverage. While delivering billions of COVID 19 doses globally addressing vaccine hesitancy will be one of the most significant public health communication efforts ever undertaken.

ObjectiveThe goal of this study is to explore predictors of COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy, including sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, risk perception, and experience of discrimination, in a sample of the U.S. population.

DesignWe used a cross sectional online survey study design. The survey was implemented between Dec 13 and 23, 2020.

SettingThe survey was limited to respondents over 18 years of age residing in the USA.

ParticipantsRespondents were individuals belonging to priority groups for vaccine distribution.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Respondents were asked how likely they would be to take a COVID 19 vaccine if offered at no cost within two months. Vaccine hesitancy was measured using a scale ranging from 1 (low hesitancy) to 6 (high hesitancy).

ResultsResponses were received from 2,650 respondents (response rate 84%) from all 50 states and Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam. The majority were in the age category between 25 and 44 years (66%), male (53%), and working in the healthcare sector (61%). Most were White and non-Hispanic (66%) respondents followed by Black non-Hispanic (14%) and Hispanic (8%) respondents. Experience with racial discrimination was a predictor of vaccine hesitancy. Those reporting racial discrimination having 21% increased odds of being at a higher level of hesitancy compared to those who did not report such experience (OR=1.21, 95% C.I. 1.01-1.45).

145,Based Analysis Framework for identifying COVID-19 Incidence and Fatality Determinants at National Level Case study: Africa,"BackgroundCOVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary threat with significant implications in all aspects of human life, therefore, it represents the most immediate challenges for all countries all over the world.

ObjectivesThis study is intended to develop a GIS-based analysis model to explore, quantify and model the relationships between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and their potential predictor variables.

MethodFor this purpose, a model was developed to estimate COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates in Africa up to 16th of August 2020 at the national level. The model involved Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis through ArcGIS was applied.

ResultSpatial Autocorrelation Analysis revealed that there was positive spatial autocorrelation in COVID-19 incidence (Moran index 0.16. P value <0.1), and fatality (Moran index 0.0.35, P value<0.01) rates within different African countries. At continental level, OLS revealed that COVID-19 incidence rate was found to be positively associated with overcrowding, health expenditure, HIV infections and air pollution and negatively associated with BCG vaccine ({beta}=2.97,1.45, 0.01, 3.29, -47.65 respectively, P< 0.05) At the same time, COVID-19 fatality was found to be positively related to asthma prevalence and tobacco use. Yet, certain level of inconsistency was noted in the case of COVID-19 fatality, which was negatively related to elder population, poverty, and cardiovascular mortality (P<0.05). This model showed convenient level of validity in modeling the relationship between COVID-19 incidence as well as fatality and their key predictors using GWR. In this respect, the model explained about 58% and 55% of the variance in COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates, respectively, as a function of considered predictors.

146,Impact of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) on the Mental Health and Physical Activity of Pharmacy Students at the University of Zambia: A Cross-Sectional Study,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a serious global health problem that has negatively impacted the mental health of students.

MethodsWe conducted an online descriptive cross-sectional study among 273 undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. A partial proportional odds regression model was used to determine the predictors of anxiety. All statistical tests were set at 95% confidence level (p<0.05).

ResultsA response rate of 70% was obtained with the majority of the students being female 51.6%. Of the 273 respondents, 23.8% did not experience anxiety, 34.4% experienced mild anxiety, 24.9% experienced moderate anxiety while 16.9% experienced severe anxiety about COVID-19. It was also found that 61.2% of students reported that their attention to mental health increased during the COVID-19 pandemic whereas 44.3% reported an increased resting time with a significant reduction in relaxation 51.3% and physical activity 45.4% time. Factors that affected mental health included; reduced family care (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.09-4.74), not changing attention to mental health (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18-0.62), being in the final year of study (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13-0.84), reduced time of resting (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.26-3.50) and feeling helpless (OR: 0.42; 95% CI:0.23-0.75).

ConclusionCOVID-19 negatively impacted the mental health and physical activity of pharmacy students at the University of Zambia.

147,Aerosol tracer testing in the cabin of wide-bodied Boeing 767 and 777 aircraft to simulate exposure potential of infectious particulate such as SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reintroduced questions regarding the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure amongst passengers on an aircraft. Quantifying risk with computational fluid dynamics models or contact tracing methods alone is challenging, as experimental results for inflight biological aerosols is lacking. Using fluorescent aerosol tracers and real time optical sensors, coupled with DNA-tagged tracers for aerosol deposition, we executed ground and inflight testing on Boeing 767 and 777 airframes.

Analysis here represents tracer particles released from a simulated infected passenger, in multiple rows and seats, to determine the exposure risk via penetration into breathing zones in that row and numerous rows ahead and behind the index case. We completed over 65 releases of 180,000,000 fluorescent particles from the source, with 40+ Instantaneous Biological Analyzer and Collector sensors placed in passenger breathing zones for real-time measurement of simulated virus particle penetration.

Results from both airframes showed a minimum reduction of 99.54% of 1 {micro}m aerosols from the index source to the breathing zone of a typical passenger seated directly next to the source. An average 99.97 to 99.98% reduction was measured for the breathing zones tested in the 767 and 777, respectively. Contamination of surfaces from aerosol sources was minimal, and DNA-tagged 3 {micro}m tracer aerosol collection techniques agreed with fluorescent methodologies.",Sean M Kinahan; David B Silcott; Blake E Silcott; Ryan M Silcott; Peter J Silcott; Braden J Silcott; Steven L Distelhorst; Vicki L Herrera; Danielle N Rivera; Kevin K Crown; Gabriel A Lucero; Joshua Santarpia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249626,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249626,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
148,Genomic and mobility data reveal mass population movement as a driver of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and diversity in Bangladesh,"BackgroundNew data streams are being used to track the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, including genomic data which provides insights into patterns of importation and spatial spread of the virus, as well as population mobility data obtained from mobile phones. Here, we analyse the emergence and outbreak trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh using these new data streams, and identify mass population movements as a key early event driving the ongoing epidemic.

MethodsWe sequenced complete genomes of 67 SARS-CoV-2 samples (March-July 2020) and combined this dataset with 324 genomes from Bangladesh. For phylogenetic context, we also used 68,000 GISAID genomes collected globally. We paired this genomic data with population mobility information from Facebook and three mobile phone operators.

FindingsThe majority (85%) of the Bangladeshi sequenced isolates fall into either pangolin lineage B.1.36 (8%), B.1.1 (19%) or B.1.1.25 (58%). Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis predicted SARS-COV-2 first appeared in mid-February, through international introductions. The first case was reported on March 8th. This pattern of repeated international introduction changed at the end of March when three discrete lineages expanded and spread clonally across Bangladesh. The shifting pattern of viral diversity across Bangladesh is reflected in the mobility data which shows the mass migration of people from cities to rural areas at the end of March, followed by frequent travel between Dhaka and the rest of the country during the following months.

InterpretationIn Bangladesh, population mobility out of Dhaka as well as frequent travel from urban hotspots to rural areas resulted in rapid country-wide dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. The strains in Bangladesh reflect the local expansion of global lineages introduced early from international travellers to and from major international travel hubs. Importantly, the Bangladeshi context is consistent with epidemiologic and phylogenetic findings globally. Bangladesh is one of the few countries in the world with a rich history of conducting mass vaccination campaigns under complex circumstances. Combining genomics and these new data streams should allow population movements to be modelled and anticipated rendering Bangladesh extremely well prepared to immunize citizens rapidly. Based on our genomics data and the countrys successful immunization history, vaccines becoming available globally will be suitable for implementation in Bangladesh while ongoing genomic surveillance is conducted to monitor for new variants of the virus.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic, has motivated all countries in the world to obtain high resolution data on the virus. Globally over 300,000 strains have been sequenced and information made available in GISAID. Within the first 100 days of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, genomic analysis from different countries led to the development of vaccines which have now reached market. Information on the prevailing genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 since introduction is needed in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Bangladesh, in order to determine the suitability of therapeutics and vaccines in the pipeline and help vaccine deployment.

Added value of this studyWe sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from strains that were prospectively collected during the height of the pandemic and combined these genomic data with mobility data to comprehensively describe i) how repeated international importations of SARS-CoV-2 were ultimately linked to nationwide spread, ii) 85% of strains belonged to the Pangolin lineages B.1.1, B.1.1.25 and B.1.36 and that similar mutation rates were observed as seen globally iii) the switch in genomic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 coincided with mass migration out of cities to the rest of the country. We have assessed the contributions of population mobility on the maintenance and spread of clonal lineages of SARS-CoV-2. This is the first time these data types have been combined to look at the spread of this virus nationally.

Implications of all the available evidenceSARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity and mutation rate in Bangladesh is comparable to strains circulating globally. Notably, the data on the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh is reassuring, suggesting that immunotherapeutic and vaccines being developed globally should also be suitable for this population. Since Bangladesh already has extensive experience of conducting mass vaccination campaigns, such as the rollout of the oral Cholera vaccine, experience of developing and using new data streams will enable efficient and targeted immunization of the population in 2021 with COVID-19 vaccine(s).",Lauren A.

The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness and neuromuscular performance in these patients.

MethodsPatients recovered from mild (n=31) and severe (n=17) COVID-19 were evaluated and compared to healthy subjects (n=15). All volunteers underwent a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test with simultaneous acquisition of electromyography (EMG). Power output, oxygen uptake (VO2), pulse oxygen (O2Pulse), cardiovascular efficiency ({Delta}HR/{Delta}VO2), ventilation (VE), breathing reserve (BR) and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope) were analyzed. From EMG, power output for type Ia and IIa activation as well as total neuromuscular efficiency ({Delta}watts/{Delta}%RMS) were determined.

ResultsPatients with severe COVID-19 presented lower VO2, O2Pulse and VE than mild COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects (p < 0.05 for all comparisons).

152,Hospital load and increased COVID-19 related mortality - a nationwide study in Israel,"The spread of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has led to many healthcare systems being overwhelmed by the rapid emergence of new cases within a short period of time. We explore the ramifications of hospital load due to COVID-19 morbidity on COVID-19 hospitalized patient mortality. We address this question with a nationwide study based on the records of all 19,336 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Israel from mid-July 2020 to early January 2021. We show that even under moderately heavy patient load (>500 countrywide hospitalized severely-ill patients; the Israeli Ministry of Health defined 800 severely-ill patients as the maximum capacity allowing adequate treatment), in-hospital mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 significantly increased compared to periods of lower patient load (250-500 severely-ill patients); we further show this higher mortality rate cannot be attributed to changes in the patient population during periods of heavier load.",Hagai Rossman; Tomer Meir; Jonathan Somer; Smadar Shilo; Rom Gutman; Asaf Ben Arie; Eran Segal; Uri Shalit; Malka Gorfine,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249526,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249526,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
153,Modelling the impact of household size distribution on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19,"Under the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and lockdowns, household transmission has been shown to be significant for COVID-19, posing challenges for reducing incidence in settings where people are asked to self-isolate at home and to spend increasing amounts of time at home due to distancing measures. Accordingly, characteristics of households in a region have been shown to relate to transmission heterogeneity of the virus. We introduce a stochastic epidemiological model to examine the impact of the household size distribution in a region on the transmission dynamics. We choose parameters to reflect incidence in two health regions of the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia and simulate the impact of distancing measures on transmission, with household size distribution the only different parameter between simulations for the two regions. Our result suggests that the dissimilarity in household size distribution alone can cause significant differences in incidence of the two regions, and the distributions drive distinct dynamics that match reported cases. Furthermore, our model suggests that offering individuals a place to isolate outside their household can speed the decline in cases, and does so more effectively where there are more larger households.",Pengyu Liu; Lisa McQuarrie; Yexuan Song; Caroline Colijn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249707,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249707,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
154,Immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay: a cross-sectional study conducted at Wakayama Medical University in Japan,"Asymptomatic patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection must be quickly identified and isolated to prevent the spread of the virus. The number of asymptomatic healthy people is completely unknown because they remain untested. Detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been widely accepted as a diagnostic test, and an immunochromatographic test, which is simpler and relatively cheaper than other methods, is becoming the gold standard for identifying healthy people who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past. In this study, 1,528 volunteers who worked at a particular hospital were subjected to an immunochromatographic IgG test for SARS-CoV-2 to determine the ratio of asymptomatic people. Only 12 volunteers (0.79%) were IgG+, with no significant background differences in the sex, age, profession, experiences of working at the emergency department or caring for coronavirus disease 2019 patients. If this IgG+ ratio was to be extrapolated to Wakayama citys population, 2,780 out of 3,54,063 people may be asymptomatic for SARS-CoV-2.

155,Impact of COVID-19 on the indigenous population of Brazil: A geo-epidemiological study,"This study aimed to analyze the geographical distribution of COVID-19 and to identify highrisk areas for the occurrence of cases and deaths from the disease in the indigenous population of Brazil. This is an ecological study whose units of analysis were the Special Indigenous Sanitary Districts. Cases and deaths by COVID-19 notified by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health between March and October 2020 were included. To verify the spatial association, the Getis-Ord General G and Getis-Ord Gi * techniques were used. High spatial risk clusters have been identified by the scan statistics technique. 32,041 cases of COVID-19 and 471 deaths were reported. The incidence and mortality rates were between 758.14 and 18530.56 cases and 5.96 and 265.37 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants, respectively. The non-randomness of cases (z-score = 5.40; p <0.001) and deaths (z-score = 3.83; p <0.001) was confirmed. Hotspots were evidenced for both events with confidence levels of 90, 95 and 99% concentrated in the North and Midwest regions of the country. Eight high-risk spatial clusters for cases with a relative risk (RR) between 1.08 and 4.11 (p <0.05) and two risk clusters for deaths with RR between 3.08 and 3.97 (p <0.05) were identified.

156,An insight into neurotoxic and toxicity of spike fragments SARS-CoV-2 by exposure environment: A threat to aquatic health?,"The Spike protein (S protein) is a critical component in the infection of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this work was to evaluate whether peptides from S protein could cause negative impact in the aquatic animals. The aquatic toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides derivatives has been evaluated in tadpoles (n = 50 tadpoles / 5 replicates of 10 animals) from species Physalaemus cuvieri (Leptodactylidae). After synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides (PSDP2001, PSDP2002, PSDP2003) an aquatic contamination has been simulatedwith these peptides during 24 hours of exposure in two concentrations (100 and 500 ng/mL). The control group (""C"") was composed of tadpoles kept in polyethylene containers containing de-chlorinated water. Oxidative stress, antioxidant biomarkers and neurotoxicity activity were assessed. In both concentrations, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 increased catalase and superoxide dismutase antioxidants enzymes activities, as well as oxidative stress (nitrite levels, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species). All three peptides also increased acetylcholinesterase activity in the highest concentration. These peptides showed molecular interactions in silico with acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes. Aquatic particle contamination of SARS-CoV-2 has neurotoxics effects in P. cuvieri tadpoles. These findings indicate that the COVID-19 can constitute environmental impact or biological damage potential.

157,A rapid phenomics workflow for the in vitro identification of antiviral drugs,"Morphological profiling of cells in the presence of perturbants, also known as phenomics, is gaining momentum given its successful implementation for drug discovery and compound profiling. The current COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the search for new and fast methods to identify novel or repurposed therapeutic drugs. A popular method to identify antiviral drugs is the use of antibody-based immunofluorescence to visualise infected cells. However, this method lacks depth towards the effect of such drugs on the host cells. Here we present a phenomics workflow for untargeted phenotypic drug screening of virus infected cells, combining Cell Painting with antibody-based detection of viral infection in a single and simple method and provide a semi-automated image analysis pipeline for classification and feature extraction of virus infected cells. Our phenomics workflow provides valuable information about the effect of both virus and drugs on the host cells. We validated our method using a panel of 9 antiviral compounds including known and novel compounds on MRC5 human lung fibroblasts infected with Human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E). Two of the compounds showed strong antiviral efficacy concomitant with a recovery of the morphological profile towards non-infected.",Jonne Rietdijk; Marianna Tempere; Aleksandra Pettke; Polina Georgiev; Maris Lapins; Ulrika Warpman Berglund; Ola Spjuth; Marjo-Riitta Puumalainen; Jordi Carreras-Puigvert,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.423947,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.423947,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False

159,"Molecular dynamic simulation reveals E484K mutation enhances spike RBD-ACE2 affinity and the combination of E484K, K417N and N501Y mutations (501Y.V2 variant) induces conformational change greater than N501Y mutant alone, potentially resulting in an escape mutant","Rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants present not only an increased threat to human health due to the confirmed greater transmissibility of several of these new strains but, due to conformational changes induced by the mutations, may render first-wave SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera, vaccine-induced antibodies, or recombinant neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) ineffective. To be able to assess the risk of viral escape from neutralization by first-wave antibodies, we leveraged our capability for Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation of the spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) and its binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) to predict alterations in molecular interactions resulting from the presence of the E484K, K417N, and N501Y variants found in the South African 501Y.V2 strain - alone and in combination. We report here the combination of E484K, K417N and N501Y results in the highest degree of conformational alterations of S RBD when bound to hACE2, compared to either E484K or N501Y alone. Both E484K and N501Y increase affinity of S RBD for hACE2 and E484K in particular switches the charge on the flexible loop region of RBD which leads to the formation of novel favorable contacts. Enhanced affinity of S RBD for hACE2 very likely underpins the greater transmissibility conferred by the presence of either E484K or N501Y; while the induction of conformational changes may provide an explanation for evidence that the 501Y.V2 variant, distinguished from the B.1.1.7 UK variant by the presence of E484K, is able to escape neutralization by existing first-wave anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and re-infect COVID-19 convalescent individuals.",Gard Nelson; Oleksandr Buzko; Patricia R Spilman; Kayvan Niazi; Shahrooz Rabizadeh; Patrick R Soon-Shiong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426558,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426558,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False
160,Ineffectual AEC1 Differentiation from KRT8hi Transitional Cells without Fibrosis Associated with Fatal Acute Respiratory Failure in COVID-19 ARDS,"COVID-19 ARDS is associated with prolonged ventilator dependence and high mortality, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Critical to the pathogenesis of ARDS is injury to the alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) barrier; clinical recovery requires epithelial regeneration. We previously identified a KRT8hi transitional state that regenerating AEC2s adopt during differentiation into AEC1s, the persistence of which may be pathogenic in pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we hypothesize that ineffectual differentiation of transitional cells into AEC1s without fibrosis may underlie ongoing barrier permeability and poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 ARDS. To test this hypothesis, we examined postmortem lung tissue of COVID-19 ARDS patients. We observed severe epithelial injury, AEC2 proliferation, and abundant transitional cells but ineffectual AEC1 differentiation. Transitional cells were cuboidal, partially spread, or flat and adherent to alveolar septa that were denuded of AEC1s but structurally normal without fibrosis. We conclude that ineffectual AEC1 differentiation from transitional AECs may underlie ongoing barrier permeability and poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 ARDS. However, in contrast to fibrosis, transitional cells may retain the capacity for AEC1 differentiation with restoration of normal alveolar architecture and function. Novel therapies that promote differentiation of transitional cells into AEC1s may accelerate barrier restoration and clinical recovery in ARDS.",Christopher Ting; Mohit Aspal; Neil Vaishampayan; Steven K.

161,Distinct lung-homing receptor expression and activation profiles on NK cell and T cell subsets in COVID-19 and influenza,"Respiratory viral infections with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses commonly induce a strong infiltration of immune cells into the lung, with potential detrimental effects on the integrity of the lung tissue. Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung, little is known about how blood natural killer (NK) cells and T cell subsets are equipped for lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Using 28-colour flow cytometry and re-analysis of published RNA-seq datasets, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in peripheral blood from moderately sick COVID-19 and influenza patients, focusing on the expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the lung. The results reveal a predominant role for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 in COVID-19 and influenza patients, mirrored by scRNA-seq signatures in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage from publicly available datasets. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation as compared to cells lacking lung-homing receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza as compared to COVID-19. Together, our results indicate migration of functionally competent CXCR3+, CXCR6+, and/or CCR5+ NK cells and T cells to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients, identifying potential common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral infections.

Author summaryThe composition of in particular CXCR3+ and/or CXCR6+ NK cells and T cells is altered in peripheral blood upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus in patients with moderate disease. Lung-homing receptor-expression is biased towards phenotypically activated NK cells and T cells, suggesting a functional role for these cells co-expressing in particular CXCR3 and/or CXCR6 upon homing towards the lung.",Demi Brownlie; Inga Rødahl; Renata Varnaite; Hilmir Asgeirsson; Hedvig Glans; Sara Falck-Jones; Sindhu Vangeti; Marcus Buggert; Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren; Jakob Michaëlsson; Sara Gredmark-Russ; Anna Smed-Sörensen; Nicole Marquardt,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426553,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426553,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False
162,Emergence and Evolution of a Prevalent New SARS-CoV-2 Variant in the United States,"Genomic surveillance can lead to early identification of novel viral variants and inform pandemic response. Using this approach, we identified a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in the United States (U.S.). The earliest sequenced genomes of this variant, referred to as 20C-US, can be traced to Texas in late May of 2020. This variant circulated in the U.S. uncharacterized for months and rose to recent prevalence during the third pandemic wave. It initially acquired five novel, relatively unique non-synonymous mutations. 20C-US is continuing to acquire multiple new mutations, including three independently occurring spike protein mutations. Monitoring the ongoing evolution of 20C-US, as well as other novel emerging variants, will be essential for understanding SARS-CoV-2 host adaptation and predicting pandemic outcomes.",Adrian A Pater; Michael S Bosmeny; Christopher L Barkau; Katy N Ovington; Ramdevi Chilamkurthy; Mansi Parasrampuria; Seth B Eddington; Abadat O Yinusa; Adam A White; Paige E Metz; Rourke J Sylvain; Madison M Hebert; Scott W Benzinger; Koushik T Sinha; Keith T Gagnon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.426287,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.426287,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False
163,Fatal neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice is partially dependent on hACE2 expression,"Animal models recapitulating the distinctive features of severe COVID-19 are critical to enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) under the cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE2) represent a lethal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the cause(s) and mechanisms of lethality in this mouse model remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection for up to 14 days post-infection. Despite infection and moderate inflammation in the lungs, lethality was invariably associated with viral neuroinvasion and neuronal damage (including spinal motor neurons). Neuroinvasion occurred following virus transport through the olfactory neuroepithelium in a manner that was only partially dependent on hACE2. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 tropism was overall neither widespread among nor restricted to only ACE2-expressing cells. Although our work incites caution in the utility of the K18-hACE2 model to study global aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, it underscores this model as a unique platform for exploring the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis.

SUMMARYCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus. Here, we show that in a widely used transgenic mouse model of COVID-19, lethality is invariably associated with viral neuroinvasion and the ensuing neuronal disease, while lung inflammation remains moderate.",Mariano Carossino; Paige Montanaro; Devin Kenney; Hans Gertje; Kyle Grosz; Susanna Kurnick; Markus Bosmann; Mohsan Saeed; Udeni Balasuriya; Florian Douam; Nicholas Crossland,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.425144,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.425144,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False
164,Rigid monoclonal antibodies improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the basis of treatments and diagnostics for pathogens and other biological phenomena. We conducted a structural characterization of mAbs against the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein (NPNTD) from SARS-CoV-2 using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Our solution-based results distinguished the mAbs flexibility and how this flexibility impacts the assembly of multiple mAbs on an antigen. By pairing two mAbs that bind different epitopes on the NPNTD, we show that flexible mAbs form a closed sandwich-like complex. With rigid mAbs, a juxtaposition of the Fabs is prevented, enforcing a linear arrangement of the mAb pair, which facilitates further mAb polymerization. In a modified sandwich ELISA, we show the rigid mAb-pairings with linear polymerization led to increased NPNTD detection sensitivity. These enhancements can expedite the development of more sensitive and selective antigen-detecting point-of-care lateral flow devices (LFA), key for early diagnosis and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.",Curtis D Hodge; Daniel J Rosenberg; Mateusz Wilamowski; Andrzej D Joachimiak; Greg L Hura; Michal Hammel,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426597,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426597,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False
165,Using image-based haplotype alignments to map global adaptation of SARS-CoV-2,"Quantifying evolutionary change among viral genomes is an important clinical device to track critical adaptations geographically and temporally. We built image-based haplotype-guided evolutionary inference (ImHapE) to quantify adaptations in expanding populations of non-recombining SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By combining classic population genetic summaries with image-based deep learning methods, we show that different rates of positive selection are driving evolutionary fitness and dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 globally. A 1.35-fold increase in evolutionary fitness is observed within the UK, associated with expansion of both the B.1.177 and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 lineages.",Tom W Ouellette; Jim Shaw; Philip Awadalla,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426571,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426571,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False
166,Targeting conserved viral virulence determinants by single domain antibodies to block SARS-CoV2 infectivity,"We selected SARS-CoV2 specific single domain antibodies (sdAbs) from a previously constructed phage display library using synthetic immunogenic peptides of the virus spike (S) protein as bait. The sdAbs targeting the cleavage site (CS) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in S protein efficiently neutralised the infectivity of a pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV2 S protein. Anti-CS sdAb blocked the virus infectivity by inhibiting proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV2 S protein. Both the sdAbs retained characteristic structure within the pH range of 2 to 12 and remained stable upto 65{degrees}C. Furthermore, structural disruptions induced by a high temperature in both the sdAbs were largely reversed upon their gradual cooling and the resulting products neutralised the reporter virus. Our results therefore suggest that targeting CS in addition to the RBD of S protein by sdAbs could serve as a viable option to reduce SARS-CoV2 infectivity and that proteolytic processing of the viral S protein is critical for infection.",Sudhakar Singh; Surbhi Dahiya; Yuviana J Singh; Komal Beeton; Ayush Jain; Roman Sarkar; Abhishek Dubey; Syed Azeez Tehseen; Sharvan Sehrawat,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426537,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426537,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False
167,In vitro screening of anti-viral and virucidal effects against SARS-CoV-2 by Hypericum perforatum and Echinacea.,"Special Infectious Agent Unit in King Fahd Medical Research Center at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, has pursed the anti-viral project field to optimize the group of medicinal plants for human-infectious diseases. We have begun virtually in this field since COVID-19 pandemic, besides our divergence in the infectious agents. In this study and based on the previous review, Hypericum perforatum (St. Johns Wort) and Echinacea (gaia HERBS(R)) were tested in vitro using Vero E6 cells for their anti-viral effects against the newly identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through its infectious cycle from 0 to 48 hours post infection. The hypericin (0.9 mg) of H. perforatum and the different parts (roots, seeds, aerial) of two types of Echinacea species (Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia) were examined their efficacy in certain concentration and under light-dependent anti-viral activities to measure the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA expression of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene and the viral load with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and to assess the neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding on cell culture assay. Interestingly, the mixture (H.E.) of 100 mg/mL of H. perforatum and Echinacea was tested too on SARS-CoV-2 and showed crucial anti-viral activity competing H. perforatum then Echinacea effects as anti-viral treatment. Therefore, the results of gaia HERBS(R) products, H. perforatum and Echinacea species, applied in this study showed significant anti-viral and virucidal effects in the following order of potency: H. perforatum, H.E., and Echinacea on SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle; and will definitely required a set up of clinical trial with specific therapeutic protocol based on the outcome of this study.

Author SummaryAfter an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in the Southern region of Saudi Arabia, particularly in May 2003, Special Infectious Agents Unit (SIAU) was established and founded by Prof. Esam Ibraheem Azhar. This unit contains a full range of facilities including Biosafety Level 3, allows him and his research groups to ambulate and culture risk group 3 viruses in Saudi Arabia & Gulf States for the first time. Since that time, SIAU and our international collaboration have been extended to implement a standard protocols in the infectious agents diagnostics procedure through different mode of collaboration including exchange of expertise, joint research program and more recently a technology transfer agreements with number of international institute sharing same interests. Furthermore, we have been engaged in number of researches related to Hajj & Umrah plus number of national services with the Ministry of Health (MOH) through which, we utilize our Mobile biosafety level 3 Lab to enhance the diagnostics of MERS CoV in the Holly sites during Hajj since 2014.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional observational study and collected data from Medical Record Section during the COVID-19 pandemic from January to June 2020 and compared it with data from 2019 in similar months. Data collected was analyzed to find out the impact of COVID - 19 on use of pediatric emergency health services with respect to patient attendance, age and clinical profile before and during COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi.

ResultsWe observed a 43% decline in PED visits which increased to 75% during the period of lock-down (p value = 0.005). There was a significant decrease in children of age group 1-5 years attending PED. Mortality rate during lockdown had gone up by nearly 3times than the average monthly mortality.

There are inconsistencies in the findings on the type of comorbidity of the elderly and its association with fatalities. In this context, this research investigated the impact of comorbidity in the fatality of elderly COVID-19 patients in Kerala based on their healthcare status, functionality, and morbidity profiles. A concurrent mixed-method approach was adopted for the study to achieve the objectives, where the quantitative and qualitative data had been collected in the COVID-19 situation, from June to November 2020. This studys findings have been further triangulated with the COVID-19 elderly fatality data, which is available from the crowdsourced dashboard of the research team and two other volunteering dashboards. This paper establishes that comorbidities can predict potential fatality among elderly COVID-19 patients. While facing an epidemic like the present zoonotic disease, better knowledge of these high-risk factors will help clinicians to pinpoint the situation and implement therapeutic and preventive methodologies and interventions. The comorbidity level of the elderly in Kerala matches with the profile of COVID-19 death cases where heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension are the significant predictors of COVID-19 elderly fatality in Kerala.",Sindhu Joseph; Jijo Pulickiyil Ulahannan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.20249030,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.20249030,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,True
170,Altered kidney function and acute kidney damage markers predict survival outcomes of COVID-19 patients: A prospective pilot study.,"BackgroundThe central role in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), called as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infection is attributed to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). ACE-2 expressing respiratory system involvement is the main clinical manifestation of the infection. However, literature about the association between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and higher ACE-2 expressing kidney is very limited. In this study, we primarily aimed to investigate whether there is a kidney injury during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The predictive value of kidney injury for survival was also determined.

MethodsA total of 47 participants who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The participants were classified as   COVID-19 patients before treatment   COVID-19 patients after treatment,   COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU and   controls. The parameters comorbidity, serum creatinine and cystatin C levels, CKD-EPI eGFR levels, KIM-1 and NGAL levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine and NGAL/creatinine ratios were statistically compared between the groups. The associations between covariates including kidney disease indicators and death from COVID-19 were examined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.

ResultsSerum creatinine and cystatin C levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine levels, and CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels exhibited significant difference in the groups. The causes of the difference were more altered kidney function and increased acute kidney damage in COVID-19 patients before treatment and under treatment in ICU. Additionally, incidences of comorbidity and proteinuria in the urine analysis were higher in the COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU group. Urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria were associated with COVID-19 specific death.

ConclusionsWe found that COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU exhibited extremely higher levels of serum cystatin C, and urine KIM-1/creatinine and urine NGAL/creatinine ratios. These results clearly described the acute kidney damage by COVID-19 using molecular kidney damage markers for the first time in the literature. Lowered CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels were determined in them, as well. Urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria were associated with COVID-19 specific death. In this regard, considering kidney function and kidney damage markers must not be ignored in the COVID-19 patients, and serial monitoring of them should be considered.",Mustafa Zafer Temiz; Ibrahim Hacibey; Ramazan Omer Yazar; Mehmet Salih Sevdi; Suat Hayri Kucuk; Gizem Alkurt; Levent Doganay; Gizem Dinler-Doganay; Muhammed Murat Dincer; Emrah Yuruk; Kerem Erkalp; Ahmet Yaser Muslumanoglu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.20249079,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.20249079,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,True
171,"Pragmatic, open-label, single-center, randomized, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus in patients with severe pneumonia secondary to COVID-19: the TACROVID trial protocol","IntroductionSome COVID-19 patients evolve to severe lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome triggered by both the coronavirus infection and the subsequent host-immune response. Accordingly, the use of immunomodulatory agents has been suggested but still remains controversial. Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus may be an effective and safety drug combination for treating severe COVID-19 patients.

Methods and analysisTACROVID is a randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone, in patients at advanced stage of COVID-19 disease with lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory response. Patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two arms (42 patients in each group). The primary aim is to assess the time to clinical stability after initiating randomization. Clinical stability is defined as body temperature [&le;] 37.5{degrees}C, and PaO2/FiO2 > 400 and/or SatO2/FiO2 > 300, and respiratory rate [&le;]24 rpm; for 48 consecutive hours.

DiscussionMethylprednisolone and tacrolimus might be beneficial to treat those COVID-19 patients progressing into severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. The rationale for its use is the fast effect of methylprednisolone pulses and the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit both the CoV-2 replication and the secondary cytokine storm. Interestingly, both drugs are low-cost and can be manufactured on a large scale; thus, if effective and safe, a large number of patients could be treated in developed and developing countries.

172,Assessments of heavy lift UAV quadcopter drone to support COVID 19 vaccine cold chain delivery for indigenous people in remote areasin South East Asia,"Vaccine delivery is one important aspect need to be strengthened within health systems. One of the main challenges in COVID 19 vaccine delivery is how to cover indigenous population in remote and isolated forests in South East Asia. Another issue in COVID 19 cold chain delivery is requirement for a carrier that can maintain the suitable storage temperature. Related to this condition, COVID 19 vaccine should be delivered using heavy vaccine cooler box and this demand delivery system equipped with heavy lift capacity. In here, this study proposes and assess the potential used of heavy lift UAV quadcopter to expand the COVID 19 vaccine delivery to indigenous people living in village that impeded by rugged terrain. The landscape and terrain analysis show that access to the villages was dominated by 15%-45% slopes and the available access is only 1.5 m width trail. To transport 500 vials with 10 kg carrier along 2 km trail, it requires 2 persons to walk for 1 hour. By using drone, a straight line route with a length of 1.5 km can be developed. There were at least 3 drone types were available commercially to lift 10 kg load and several drones with payload capacity below 10 kg. For carrying 100 vials to village using drones, it is estimated the required delivery time was 1.23-1.38 minutes. Around 1.57-1.66 minute delivery times were required to transport 250 vials. For carrying the maximum and full loads of 500 vials or equals to 10 kg load, a drone requires in average of 3.13 minute delivery times. This required drone delivery time is significantly below the required time by walking that almost 1 hour. Drones were limited by flight operational times. Whereas all required delivery times for each drone assessed in this study were still below the drone operational time. The lowest drone operational time was 16 minutes and this is still higher than the time required for a drone to deliver the vaccine. Considering the effectiveness and anticipating vaccine vaccination, UAV quadcopter drone is a feasible option to support COVID 19 vaccine delivery to reach indigenous people in isolated areas.",Andrio Adwibowo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249494,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249494,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,True
173,Risk factors for bacterial infections in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: A case control study,"ObjectiveBacterial infections are known to complicate respiratory viral infections and are associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. A case control study was conducted to determine risk factors for bacterial infections where cases were defined as moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 patients with bacterial infection and those without were included as controls. Logistic regression analysis was performed.

ResultsOut of a total of 50 cases and 50 controls, greater proportion of cases had severe or critical disease at presentation as compared to control i.e 80% vs 30% (p<0.001). Hospital acquired pneumonia (72%) and Gram negative organisms (82%) were predominant. Overall antibiotic utilization was 82% and was 64% in patients who had no evidence of bacterial infection. The median length of stay was significantly longer among cases compared to controls (12.5 versus 7.5 days) (p=0.001). The overall mortality was 30%, with comparatively higher proportion of deaths among cases (42% versus 18%) (p=0.009). Severe or critical COVID-19 at presentation (AOR: 4.42 times; 95% CI; 1.63-11.9) and use of steroids (AOR: 4.60; 95% CI 1.24-17.05) were independently associated with risk of bacterial infections. These findings have implications for antibiotic stewardship as antibiotics can be reserved for those at higher risk for bacterial superinfections.",Nosheen Nasir; Fazal ur Rehman; Syed Furrukh Omair,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249498,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249498,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,True
174,Enisamium is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase and shows improvement of recovery in COVID-19 patients in an interim analysis of a clinical trial,"Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 causes a mild to severe respiratory disease called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Control of SARS-CoV-2 spread will depend on vaccine-induced or naturally acquired protective herd immunity. Until then, antiviral strategies are needed to manage COVID-19, but approved antiviral treatments, such as remdesivir, can only be delivered intravenously. Enisamium (laboratory code FAV00A, trade name Amizon(R)) is an orally active inhibitor of influenza A and B viruses in cell culture and clinically approved in countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Here we show that enisamium can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections in NHBE and Caco-2 cells. In vitro, the previously identified enisamium metabolite VR17-04 directly inhibits the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that VR17-04 prevents GTP and UTP incorporation. To confirm enisamiums antiviral properties, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which needed medical care either with or without supplementary oxygen. Patients received either enisamium (500 mg per dose) or placebo for 7 days. A pre-planned interim analysis showed in the subgroup of patients needing supplementary oxygen (n = 77) in the enisamium group a mean recovery time of 11.1 days, compared to 13.9 days for the placebo group (log-rank test; p=0.0259). No significant difference was found for all patients (n = 373) or those only needing medical care (n = 296). These results thus suggest that enisamium is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and that enisamium treatment shortens the time to recovery for COVID-19 patients needing oxygen.

Significance statementSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Although vaccines are now becoming available to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread, the development of antivirals remains necessary for treating current COVID-19 patients and combating future coronavirus outbreaks. Here, we report that enisamium, which can be administered orally, can prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication and that its metabolite VR17-04 can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase in vitro. Moreover, we find that COVID-19 patients requiring supplementary oxygen, recover more quickly than patients treated with a placebo.

177,Impact of Residential Neighborhood and Race/Ethnicity on Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in the Bronx,"The socially vulnerable have been most affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to the aftermath of any major disaster. Racial and social minorities are experiencing a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of residential location/community and race/ethnicity on outcomes of COVID-19 infection among hospitalized patients within the Bronx. This was a single center retrospective observational cohort study that included SARS-CoV2 positive adult residents of the Bronx (stratified as residents of South Bronx vs Rest of Bronx) hospitalized between March-May 2020. Data extracted from hospital electronic medical records included residential addresses, race, comorbidities, and insurance details. Comorbidity burden other clinical and laboratory details were also assessed to determine their correlation to COVID-19 severity of illness and outcomes of mortality and length of stay.

As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic differentially affected outcomes in those in the more socially disadvantaged area of the South Bronx versus the rest of the Bronx borough. Residents of the South Bronx had a significantly higher comorbidity burden and had public insurance to access medical care in comparison to the remainder of the Bronx. Interestingly, for the patient population studied there was no observed difference in 30-day mortality by race/ethnicity among those infected with COVID- 19 in spite of the increased disease burden observed.

179,Exploration of interethnic variation in the ibuprofen metabolizing enzyme CYP2C9: a cautionary guide for treatment of COVID-19 symptoms,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a rapidly spreading infectious illness that causes a debilitating respiratory syndrome. Supportive therapy remains the standard for mild-to-moderate cases, including treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) e.g. ibuprofen, however such medications may increase COVID-19 complications when used in patients with acute viral respiratory infections. P450 enzyme CYP2C9 are known to be involved in the metabolism of NSAIDs, however, their pharmacogenetic data are limited. This study aims to better understand the genetic landscape of CYP2C9 sequence variation across different ethnic and geographic groups, in correlation with ibuprofen dosing guidelines. A cohort of 101 Jordanian Arab samples were retrospectively recruited and genotyped using Affymetrix DMET Plus Premier Package. This study identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2C9 in these Jordanian Arabs, within the context of over 100,000 global subjects in 417 published reports. Genetic structure analysis across populations revealed that Jordanian Arabs share the closest CYP2C9 sequence homology to Near East and European populations. However, European populations are 7.2x more likely to show impaired ibuprofen metabolism than Sub-Saharan populations, and 4.5x more likely than East Asian ancestry populations.. This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis for CYP2C9 allele frequencies across multi-ethnic populations world-wide. The use of modern genomic tools coupled with a proactive assessment of the most likely gene-drug candidates will lead to a better understanding of the role of pharmacogenetics for COVID-19 and more effective treatments.",Ammar Ali Almarzooq,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249508,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249508,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,True
180,Performance and Implementation Evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW Rapid Antigen Test in a High-throughput Drive-through Community Testing Site in Massachusetts,"BackgroundRapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Ag) that can be performed at point-of-care (POC) can supplement molecular testing and help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Deployment of an Ag RDT requires an understanding of its operational and performance characteristics under real-world conditions and in relevant subpopulations. We evaluated the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site in Massachusetts (MA) using anterior nasal (AN) swab RT-PCR for clinical testing.

MethodsIndividuals presenting for molecular testing in two of seven lanes were offered the opportunity to also receive BinaxNOW testing. Dual AN swabs were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic children ([&le;] 18 years) and adults. BinaxNOW testing was performed in a testing pod with temperature/humidity monitoring. One individual performed testing and official result reporting for each test, but most tests had a second independent reading to assess inter-operator agreement. Positive BinaxNOW results were scored as faint, medium, or strong. Positive BinaxNOW results were reported to patients by phone and they were instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations.

ResultsOf 2482 participants, 1380 adults and 928 children had paired RT-PCR/BinaxNOW results and complete symptom data. 974/1380 (71%) adults and 829/928 (89%) children were asymptomatic. BinaxNOW had 96.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.0-99.3) sensitivity and 100% (98.6-100.0) specificity in adults within 7 days of symptoms, and 84.6% (65.1-95.6) sensitivity and 100% (94.5-100.0) specificity in children within 7 days of symptoms. Sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic adults were 70.2% (56.6-81.6) and 99.6% (98.9-99.9), respectively, and in asymptomatic children were 65.4% (55.6-74.4) and 99.0% (98.0-99.6), respectively. By cycle threshold (Ct) value cutoff, sensitivity in all subgroups combined (n=292 RT-PCR-positive individuals) was 99.3% with Ct [&le;]25, 95.8% with [&le;]30, and 81.2% with [&le;]35. Twelve false positive BinaxNOW results (out of 2308 tests) were observed; in all twelve, the test bands were faint but otherwise normal, and were noted by both readers. One invalid BinaxNOW result was identified. Inter-operator agreement (positive versus negative BinaxNOW result) was 100% (n = 2230/2230 double reads). Each operator was able to process 20 RDTs per hour. In a separate set of 30 specimens (from individuals with symptoms [&le;]7 days) run at temperatures below the manufacturers recommended range (46-58.5{degrees}F), sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity 95.2%.

ConclusionsBinaxNOW had very high specificity in both adults and children and very high sensitivity in newly symptomatic adults. Overall, 95.8% sensitivity was observed with Ct [&le;] 30. These data support public health recommendations for use of the BinaxNOW test in adults with symptoms for [&le;]7 days without RT-PCR confirmation. Excellent inter-operator agreement indicates that an individual can perform and read the BinaxNOW test alone. A skilled laboratorian can perform and read 20 tests per hour.

181,Serologic Surveillance and Phylogenetic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hospital Health Care Workers,"BACKGROUNDIt is unclear how, when and where health care workers (HCW) working in hospitals are infected with SARS-CoV-2.

METHODSProspective cohort study comprising 4-weekly measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and questionnaires from March to June 2020. We compared SARS-CoV-2 incidence between HCW working in Covid-19 patient care, HCW working in non-Covid-19 patient care and HCW not in patient care. Phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 samples from patients and HCW were performed to identify potential transmission clusters.

RESULTSWe included 801 HCW: 439 in the Covid-19 patient care group, 164 in the non-Covid-19 patient care group and 198 in the no patient care group. SARS-CoV-2 incidence was highest in HCW working in Covid-19 patient care (13.2%), as compared with HCW in non-Covid-19 patient care (6.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 4.3) and in HCW not working in patient care (3.6%, HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.6). Within the group of HCW caring for Covid-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was highest in HCW working on Covid-19 wards (25.7%), as compared with HCW working on intensive care units (7.1%, HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9 to 6.9), and HCW working in the emergency room (8.0%, HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 7.1). Phylogenetic analyses on Covid-19 wards identified multiple potential HCW-to-HCW transmission clusters while no patient-to-HCW transmission clusters were identified.

CONCLUSIONSHCW working on Covid-19 wards are at increased risk for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an important role for HCW-to-HCW transmission.

182,Epidemiological impact of prioritizing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination by antibody status: Mathematical modeling analyses,"BackgroundVaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, but their availability falls far short of global needs. This study aimed to investigate the impact of prioritizing available doses on the basis of recipient antibody status, that is by exposure status, using Qatar as an example.

MethodsVaccination impact was assessed under different scale-up scenarios using a deterministic meta-population mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression in the presence of vaccination.

ResultsFor a vaccine that protects against infection with an efficacy of 95%, half as many vaccinations were needed to avert one infection, disease outcome, or death by prioritizing antibody-negative individuals for vaccination. Prioritization by antibody status reduced incidence at a faster rate and led to faster elimination of infection and return to normalcy. Further prioritization by age group amplified the gains of prioritization by antibody status. Gains from prioritization by antibody status were largest in settings where the proportion of the population already infected at the commencement of vaccination was 30-60%, which is perhaps where most countries will be by the time vaccination programs are up and running. For a vaccine that only protects against disease and not infection, vaccine impact was reduced by half, whether this impact was measured in terms of averted infections or disease outcomes, but the relative gains from using antibody status to prioritize vaccination recipients were similar.

ConclusionsMajor health, societal, and economic gains can be achieved more quickly by prioritizing those who are antibody-negative while doses of the vaccine remain in short supply.",Houssein H.

184,Using excess deaths and testing statistics to improve estimates of COVID-19 mortalities,"Factors such as non-uniform definitions of mortality, uncertainty in disease prevalence, and biased sampling complicate the quantification of fatality during an epidemic. Regardless of the employed fatality measure, the infected population and the number of infection-caused deaths need to be consistently estimated for comparing mortality across regions. We combine historical and current mortality data, a statistical testing model, and an SIR epidemic model, to improve estimation of mortality. We find that the average excess death across the entire US is 13% higher than the number of reported COVID-19 deaths. In some areas, such as New York City, the number of weekly deaths is about eight times higher than in previous years. Other countries such as Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Spain exhibit excess deaths significantly higher than their reported COVID-19 deaths. Conversely, we find negligible or negative excess deaths for part and all of 2020 for Denmark, Germany, and Norway.",Lucas Boettcher; Maria R.

Here we investigated the impact of male sex and age by infecting adult male, aged male, and adult female ferrets with SARS-CoV-2. Aged male ferrets had a decrease in temperature which was accompanied by prolonged viral replication with increased pathology in the upper respiratory tract after infection. Transcriptome analysis of the nasal turbinates and lungs indicated that female ferrets had significant increases in interferon response genes (OASL, MX1, ISG15, etc.) on day 2 post infection which was delayed in aged males. In addition, genes associated with taste and smell such as RTP1, CHGA, and CHGA1 at later time points were upregulated in males but not in females. These results provide insight into COVID-19 and suggests that older males may play a role in viral transmission due to decreased antiviral responses.",Magen Francis; Brian Richardson; Mara McNeil; Melissa Rioux; Anni Ge; Roger Pechous; Jason Kindrachuk; Cheryl Cameron; Christopher Richardson; Jocelyne Lew; Mark Cameron; Volker Gerdts; Darryl Falzarano; Alyson  Ann Ann Kelvin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426381,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426381,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,False

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomains with and without the N501Y mutation, in complex with the VH fragment of the potent neutralizing antibody, VH -Fc ab8. The mutation results in localized structural perturbations near Y501, but VH -Fc ab8 retains the ability to bind and neutralize pseudotyped viruses expressing the N501Y mutant with efficiencies comparable to that of unmutated viruses.

187,Snake venom phospholipases A2 possess a strong virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and block the cell fusion mediated by spike glycoprotein interaction with the ACE2 receptor,"A new coronavirus was recently discovered and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the absence of specific therapeutic and prophylactic agents, the virus has infected almost hundred million people, of whom nearly two million have died from the viral disease COVID-19. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat requiring new therapeutic strategies. Among them, antiviral studies based on natural molecules are a promising approach. The superfamily of phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) consists of a large number of members that catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids at a specific position. Here we show that secreted PLA2s from the venom of various snakes protect to varying degrees the Vero E6 cells widely used for the replication of viruses with evident cytopathic action, from SARS-CoV-2 infection PLA2s showed low cytotoxicity to Vero E6 cells and the high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values ranged from 0.06 to 7.71 g/ml. Dimeric PLA2 HDP-2 from the viper Vipera nikolskii, as well as its catalytic and inhibitory subunits, had potent virucidal (neutralizing) activity against SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of the enzymatic activity of the catalytic subunit of dimeric PLA2 led to a significant decrease in antiviral activity. In addition, dimeric PLA2 inhibited cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. These results suggest that snake PLA2s, in particular dimeric ones, are promising candidates for the development of antiviral drugs that target lipid bilayers of the viral envelope and may be good tools to study the interaction of viruses with host cell membranes.",Andrei E Siniavin; Maria A Nikiforova; Svetlana D Grinkina; Vladimir A Gushchin; Vladislav G Starkov; Alexey V Osipov; Victor I Tsetlin; Yuri N Utkin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426042,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426042,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,False
188,Novel RT-ddPCR assays for determining the transcriptional profile of SARS-CoV-2,"The exact mechanism of coronavirus replication and transcription is not fully understood; however, a hallmark of coronavirus transcription is the generation of negative-sense RNA intermediates that serve as the templates for the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and an array of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) encompassing sequences arising from discontinuous transcription.

Existing PCR-based diagnostic assays for SAR-CoV-2 are qualitative or semi-quantitative and do not provide the resolution needed to assess the complex transcription dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of infection. We developed and validated a novel panel of specially designed SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR-based assays to map the viral transcription profile. Application of these assays to clinically relevant samples will enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription and may also inform the development of improved diagnostic tools and therapeutics.

189,Cerebrospinal fluid in COVID-19 neurological complications: no cytokine storm or neuroinflammation.,"BACKGROUNDNeurological complications occur in COVID-19. We aimed to examine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications and determine presence of neuroinflammatory changes implicated in pathogenesis.

METHODSCross-sectional study of CSF neuroinflammatory profiles from 18 COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications categorized by diagnosis (stroke, encephalopathy, headache) and illness severity (critical, severe, moderate, mild). COVID-19 CSF was compared with CSF from healthy, infectious and neuroinflammatory disorders and stroke controls (n=82). Cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IFN{gamma}, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A), inflammation and coagulation markers (high-sensitivity-C Reactive Protein [hsCRP], ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, Factor VIII) and neurofilament light chain (NF-L), were quantified. SARS-CoV2 RNA and SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgA antibodies in CSF were tested with RT-PCR and ELISA.

RESULTSCSF from COVID-19 subjects showed a paucity of neuroinflammatory changes, absence of pleocytosis or specific increases in pro-inflammatory markers or cytokines (IL-6, ferritin, or D-dimer). Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in CSF of COVID-19 subjects (77%) were observed despite no evidence of SARS-CoV2 viral RNA. A similar increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-12p70) and IL-10 in CSF of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 stroke subjects was observed compared to controls. CSF-NF-L was elevated in subjects with stroke and critical COVID-19. CSF-hsCRP was present almost exclusively in COVID-19 cases.

CONCLUSIONThe paucity of neuroinflammatory changes in CSF of COVID-19 subjects and lack of SARS-CoV2 RNA do not support the presumed neurovirulence of SARS-CoV2 or neuroinflammation in pathogenesis of neurological complications in COVID-19. Elevated CSF-NF-L indicates neuroaxonal injury in COVID-19 cases. The role of CSF SARS-CoV2 IgG antibodies is still undetermined.

190,Inhibitor Binding Modulates Protonation States in the Active Site of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,"The main protease (3CL Mpro) from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is an essential enzyme for viral replication with no human counterpart, making it an attractive drug target. Although drugs have been developed to inhibit the proteases from HIV, hepatitis C and other viruses, no such therapeutic is available to inhibit the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. To directly observe the protonation states in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and to elucidate their importance in inhibitor binding, we determined the structure of the enzyme in complex with the -ketoamide inhibitor telaprevir using neutron protein crystallography at near-physiological temperature. We compared protonation states in the inhibitor complex with those determined for a ligand-free neutron structure of Mpro. This comparison revealed that three active-site histidine residues (His41, His163 and His164) adapt to ligand binding, altering their protonation states to accommodate binding of telaprevir. We suggest that binding of other -ketoamide inhibitors can lead to the same protonation state changes of the active site histidine residues. Thus, by studying the role of active site protonation changes induced by inhibitors we provide crucial insights to help guide rational drug design, allowing precise tailoring of inhibitors to manipulate the electrostatic environment of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.",Daniel W.

191,Factors indicating intention to vaccinate with a COVID-19 vaccine among older U.S. Adults,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSThe success of vaccination efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic will require broad public uptake of immunization and highlights the importance of understanding factors associated with willingness to receive a vaccine.

METHODSAdults enrolled in the Heartline clinical study were invited to complete a COVID-19 vaccine assessment through the Heartline mobile application between November 6-20, 2020. Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm.

RESULTSAmong 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n=7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report.

CONCLUSIONSEven among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake. Education by health providers directed toward assuaging concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy can help improve vaccine acceptance among those less willing.

192,Indoor dust as a matrix for surveillance of COVID-19 outbreaks,"Ongoing disease surveillance is a critical tool to mitigate viral outbreaks, especially during a pandemic. Environmental monitoring has significant promise even following widespread vaccination among high-risk populations. The goal of this work is to demonstrate molecular SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in bulk floor dust and related samples as a proof-of-concept of a non-invasive environmental surveillance methodology for COVID-19 and potentially other viral diseases. Surface swab, passive sampler, and bulk floor dust samples were collected from rooms of individuals infected with COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 was measured with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and two digital PCR (dPCR) methods. Bulk dust samples had geometric mean concentration of 159 copies/mg-dust and ranged from non-detects to 23,049 copies/mg-dust detected using ddPCR. An average of 88% of bulk dust samples were positive for the virus among detection methods compared to 55% of surface swabs and fewer on the passive sampler (19% carpet, 29% polystyrene). In bulk dust, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 76%, 93%, and 97% of samples measured by qPCR, chip-based dPCR, and droplet dPCR respectively. Detectable viral RNA in the bulk vacuum bags did not measurably decay over 4 weeks, despite the application of a disinfectant before room cleaning. Future monitoring efforts should further evaluate RNA persistence and heterogeneity in dust. This study did not measure virus viability in dust or potential transmission associated with dust. Overall, this work demonstrates that bulk floor dust is a potentially useful matrix for long-term monitoring of viral disease outbreaks in high-risk populations and buildings.

ImportanceEnvironmental surveillance to assess pathogen presence within a community is proving to be a critical tool to protect public health, and it is especially relevant during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, environmental surveillance tools also allow for the detection of asymptomatic disease carriers and for routine monitoring of a large number of people as has been shown for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring. However, additional monitoring techniques are needed to screen for outbreaks in high-risk settings such as congregate care facilities. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in bulk floor dust collected from rooms housing infected individuals. This analysis suggests that dust may be a useful and efficient matrix for routine surveillance of viral disease outbreaks.",Nicole Renninger; Nicholas Nastasi; Ashleigh Bope; Samuel J.

It considers: (i) fluctuations in transmission strength; (ii) seasonal fluctuations in contact rates and (iii) fluctuations in testing. Using dynamic causal modelling, we evaluated the contribution of all combinations of these three mechanisms using Bayesian model comparison. We found overwhelming evidence for the combination of all mechanisms, when explaining 16 types of data. Quantitatively, there was clear evidence for an increase in transmission strength of 57% over the past months (e.g., due to viral mutation), in the context of increased contact rates (e.g., rebound from national lockdowns) and increased test rates (e.g., due to the inclusion of lateral flow tests). Models with fluctuating transmission strength outperformed models with fluctuating contact rates. However, the best model included all three mechanisms suggesting that the resurgence during the second peak can be explained by an increase in effective contact rate that is the product of a rebound of contact rates following a national lockdown and increased transmission risk due to viral mutation.",Karl Friston; Anthony Costello; Guillaume Flandin; Adeel Razi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249520,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249520,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,True

High mortality has been observed in COVID-19-related diabetic ketoacidosis; however, evidence is scarce.

Patients and MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted using EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar from January to December 2020 to identify all case reports describing DKA, HHS, and EDKA, in COVID-19 patients. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for case reports was used for quality assessment. Univariate and multivariate analysis assessed correlations of study origin, combined DKA/HHS, age, BMI, HbA1c, administered antidiabetics, comorbidities, symptoms onset, disease status, CRP, ferritin, d-dimers, glucose, osmolarity, pH, bicarbonates, ketones, lactates, {beta}-hydroxybutyric acid, anion gap, and acute kidney injury (AKI) with outcome.

195,Accurate Covid-19 prevalence measurement in the field,"Accurate epidemic prevalence measurement is a necessary condition for informed policy decision-making. In the Covid-19 pandemic especially, wrong prevalence measurement can lead to tremendous waste, be that in life years or economic output. A number of countries offer random Covid-19 tests to estimate the prevalence of the virus in the population, and report daily positivity rates. However, since virus testing has to be voluntary, all tests done in the field, even if supposedly random, suffer from selection bias. This bias, unlike standard biases in polling, is not limited to having a representative sample, and thus cannot be corrected by the usual methods (quota sampling etc). The issue is that people who feel they have symptoms (or other reasons to suspect they are carrying the virus), are up to 38 times more likely to volunteer to get tested, and testing stations cannot readily correct this by oversampling (i.e. selecting people without symptoms to test). Using controlled, incentivized online experiments with over 500 subjects of all ages in a European country, we show that this difference in testing propensities leads to sizeable bias; ""random"" tests in the field inflate infection figures by up to five times. We suggest ways to correct the bias of the testing stations, but even better, a cleaner way to sample the population to avoid the bias altogether.

However, the molecular mechanisms underneath remain poorly understood. In this study, 144 COVID-19 patients were enrolled to monitor the clinical and laboratory parameters over three weeks. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was shown elevated in the COVID-19 patients on admission and declined during the convalescence period, and its ability to classify patient severity outperformed other clinical indicators. A threshold of 247 U/L serum LDH on admission was determined for severity prognosis. Next, we classified a subset of 14 patients into high- and low-risk groups based on serum LDH expression and compared their quantitative serum proteomic and metabolomic differences. The results found COVID-19 patients with high serum LDH exhibited differentially expressed blood coagulation and immune responses including acute inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation, complement cascade, as well as multiple different metabolic responses including lipid metabolism, protein ubiquitination and pyruvate fermentation. Specifically, activation of hypoxia responses was highlighted in patients with high LDH expressions.

199,Atmospheric PM2.5 before and after Lockdown in relation to COVID-19 Evolution and daily Viral Counts: Could Viral Natural Selection have occurred due to changes in the Airborne Pollutant PM2.5 acting as a Vector for SARS-CoV-2?,"BackgroundGenes coding for SARS-CoV-2 have been detected on the microscopic airborne pollutant particulate matter, which has been suggested as a vector for COVID-19 transmission. Lockdown in China has been shown to be associated with significant reduction in pollution including the particulate matter component which coincided with the appearance of a viral mutant (Clade G) which steadily displaced the original Clade D after lockdown. The reason why Clade G developed a fitness advantage is as yet unknown. This paper examines the possible role of airborne particulate matter PM2.5 as selective pressure determining viral Clade predominance and further shedding light on the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

MethodsThe average levels of PM2.5 of a number of cities were obtained from the Air Quality Index (AQI), a real-time assessment of atmospheric pollution. The daily average PM2.5 levels were assessed between January 23rd and April 29th 2020 determined by the timeline when viral counts in Beijing and other cities were available. Daily viral counts of Clades D and G were available starting from the 12th February as determined by the scientific literature published in August 2020. The cities chosen were Beijing, Sheffield, Nottingham, Sydney and Cambridge because of their substantially elevated viral counts compared to other cities. Cities as opposed to vaster areas/nations were chosen as PM2.5 levels vary across regions and countries.

ResultsFor the time period assessed, the Beijing PM2.5 pattern initiated with highly elevated mean PM2.5 levels of 155.8{micro}g/m3 (SD+/-73.6) during high viral counts, followed by 82.1{micro}g/m3 (SD+/-44.9) (p<0.04) when the viral counts decreased. In all the other cities assessed, the pattern differed whereby the PM2.5 levels increased significantly over the preceding baseline contemporaneously with the viral count rise. The changes in these cities PM2.5 levels were on average 31.5{micro}g/m3 before viral counts rose and 56.35{micro}g/m3 contemporaneous with viral count rise. The average levels of PM2.5 in these cities started to decrease one week after lockdown to 46{micro}g/m3 when measured over 2 weeks post-lockdown.

As regards the viral counts from data retrieved from Beijing, the latter part of the bell-shaped curve and a subsequent smaller curve of the viral count was available for evaluation. The average viral count for Clade D in Beijing was 11.1(SD+/-13.5) followed by a mean viral count for Clade G was 13.8(SD+/-9.2). Conversely in all the other cities besides Beijing, the viral counts averaged 45.8 for Clade D and 161 for Clade G. The variation in viral counts between cities suggests the strong possibility of variation in the availability of sampling between cities.

The newer variant, Clade G demonstrated viral counts initially appearing in mid-February in Beijing to later displace Clade D as the dominant viral Clade. The appearance of Clade G coincided with the decreasing gradient of PM2.5 levels. A number of significant correlations were obtained between PM2.5 levels and the viral count in all the cities reviewed.

ConclusionCOVID-19 viral counts appear to increase concomitant with increasing PM2.5 levels. Viral counts of both Clades correlated differentially with PM2.5 levels in all the cities assessed. The significantly highly elevated PM2.5 levels in Beijing resulted in correlating mainly with Clade D, however Clade G began to appear with decreasing PM2.5 levels, suggesting the beginnings for the initial SARS-CoV-2 Clade evolution. Clade G, the newer variant was able to flourish at lower levels of PM2.5 than Clade D. Clade G may possibly have utilized other sources of particulate matter as a viral vector, such as that derived from tobacco smoking, whereby 66% of Chinese males are smokers and 70% of the Chinese non-smoking population are exposed to 2nd hand smoking.",Yves Muscat Baron,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249548,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249548,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,True
200,Robotic RNA extraction for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using saliva samples,"Saliva is an attractive specimen type for asymptomatic surveillance of COVID-19 in large populations due to its ease of collection and its demonstrated utility for detecting RNA from SARS-CoV-2. Multiple saliva-based viral detection protocols use a direct-to-RT-qPCR approach that eliminates nucleic acid extraction but can reduce viral RNA detection sensitivity. To improve test sensitivity while maintaining speed, we developed a robotic nucleic acid extraction method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples with high throughput. Using this assay, the Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (IGI-FAST) research study on the UC Berkeley campus conducted 11,971 tests on supervised self-collected saliva samples and identified rare positive specimens containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA during a time of low infection prevalence. In an attempt to increase testing capacity, we further adapted our robotic extraction assay to process pooled saliva samples. We also benchmarked our assay against the gold standard, nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Finally, we designed and validated a RT-qPCR test suitable for saliva self-collection. These results establish a robotic extraction-based procedure for rapid PCR-based saliva testing that is suitable for samples from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.",Jennifer R.

201,Characteristics of changes in circulating markers of alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome with COVID-19,"The time course and specific contributions of alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury to the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the characteristics of circulating markers of alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury in 107 serum samples from nine ARDS patients and eight non-ARDS patients, all with COVID-19. Although both the alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury markers were markedly elevated in the COVID-19 ARDS patients, our data indicate that the endothelial injury, which continues for a longer period than the epithelial injury, seems to be the main contributor to alveolar barrier disruption.",Kentaro Tojo; Natsuhiro Yamamoto; Takahiro Mihara; Miyo Abe; Takahisa Goto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249528,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249528,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,True

We analyzed 68,557 single-nucleus transcriptomes from three brain regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medulla oblongata and choroid plexus) and identified an increased proportion of stromal cells and monocytes in the choroid plexus of COVID-19 patients. Differential gene expression, pseudo-temporal trajectory and gene regulatory network analyses revealed microglial transcriptome perturbations, mediating a range of biological processes, including cellular activation, mobility and phagocytosis. Quantification of viral spike S1 protein and SARS-CoV-2 transcripts did not support the notion of brain tropism. Overall, our findings suggest extensive neuroinflammation in patients with acute COVID-19.

203,Immunological and cardio-vascular pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden syrian hamster,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infection in golden Syrian hamster (GSH) causes lungs pathology and resembles to human corona virus disease (Covid-19). Extra-pulmonary pathologies and immunological parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection remained undefined in GSH. Using in silico modelling, we identified the similarities between human and hamster angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) that bind to receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S1 fragment of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection led to lung pathologies, and cardiovascular complications (CVC) marked by interstitial coronary fibrosis and acute inflammatory response. Serum lipidomic and metabolomic profile of SARS-CoV-2-infected GSH revealed changes in serum triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and alterations in metabolites that correlated with Covid19. Together, we propose GSH as an animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and its therapy associated with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary pathologies.

204,Hypoxia reduces cell attachment of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by modulating the expression of ACE2 and heparan sulfate,"A main clinical parameter of Covid-19 pathophysiology is hypoxia. Here we show that hypoxia decreases the attachment of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S1 subunit (S1) of the spike protein to epithelial cells. In Vero E6 cells, hypoxia reduces the protein levels of ACE2, which might in part explain the observed reduction of the infection rate. However, hypoxia also inhibits the binding of the spike to human lung epithelial cells lacking ACE2 expression, indicating that hypoxia modulates the expression of additional binding partners of SARS-CoV-2. We show that hypoxia also decreases the total cell surface levels of heparan sulfate, a known attachment receptor of SARS-CoV-2, by reducing the expression of syndecan-1 and syndecan3, the main proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate. Our study indicates that hypoxia acts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the hypoxia signaling pathway might offer therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of Covid-19.",Endika Prieto-Fernandez; Leire Egia-Mendikute; Laura Vila-Vecilla; So Young Lee; Alexandre Bosch; Adrian Barreira-Manrique; Ana Garcia del Rio; Asier Antonana-Vildosola; Borja Jimenez-Lasheras; Asis Palazon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.426021,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.426021,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,False
205,Potent SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies Directed Against Spike N-Terminal Domain Target a Single Supersite,"Numerous antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, and these generally target either the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the viral spike. While RBD-directed antibodies have been extensively studied, far less is known about NTD-directed antibodies. Here we report cryo-EM and crystal structures for seven potent NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies in complex with spike or isolated NTD. These structures defined several antibody classes, with at least one observed in multiple convalescent donors. The structures revealed all seven antibodies to target a common surface, bordered by glycans N17, N74, N122, and N149. This site - formed primarily by a mobile {beta}-hairpin and several flexible loops - was highly electropositive, located at the periphery of the spike, and the largest glycan-free surface of NTD facing away from the viral membrane. Thus, in contrast to neutralizing RBD-directed antibodies that recognize multiple non-overlapping epitopes, potent NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies target a single supersite.",Gabriele Cerutti; Yicheng Guo; Tongqing Zhou; Jason Gorman; Myungjin Lee; Micah Rapp; Eswar R Reddem; Jian Yu; Fabiana Bahna; Jude Bimela; Yaoxing Huang; Phinikoula S Katsamba; Liu Lihong; Manoj S Nair; Reda Rawi; Adam S Olia; Pengfei Wang; Gwo-Yu Chuang; David D Ho; Zizhang Sheng; Peter D Kwong; Lawrence Shapiro,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.426120,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.426120,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,False
206,Molecular Dynamics Analysis of a Flexible Loop at the Binding Interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor-Binding Domain,"Since the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, considerable effort has been spent characterizing the interaction between the Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This has provided a detailed picture of the end point structure of the RBD-ACE2 binding event, but what remains to be elucidated is the conformation and dynamics of the RBD prior to its interaction with ACE2. In this work we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to probe the flexibility and conformational ensemble of the unbound state of the receptor-binding domain from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We have found that the unbound RBD has a localized region of dynamic flexibility in Loop 3 and that mutations identified during the COVID-19 pandemic in Loop 3 do not affect this flexibility. We use a loop-modeling protocol to generate and simulate novel conformations of the CoV2-RBD Loop 3 region that sample conformational space beyond the ACE2 bound crystal structure. This has allowed for the identification of interesting substates of the unbound RBD that are lower energy than the ACE2-bound conformation, and that block key residues along the ACE2 binding interface. These novel unbound substates may represent new targets for therapeutic design.",Jonathan K Williams; Baifan Wang; Andrew Sam; Cody L Hoop; David A Case; Jean Baum,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425965,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425965,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,False

Here, we evaluated a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based intranasal vectored-vaccine in mice and hamsters for its immunogenicity, safety and protective efficacy in challenge studies with SARS-CoV-2. The recombinant (r)NDV-S vaccine expressing spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 administrated via intranasal route in mice induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG2a antibodies and T cell-mediated immunity. Hamsters vaccinated with two doses of vaccine showed complete protection from clinical disease including lung infection, inflammation, and pathological lesions after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Importantly, a single or double dose of intranasal rNDV-S vaccine completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 shedding in nasal turbinate and lungs within 4 days of vaccine administration in hamsters. Taken together, intranasal administration of rNDV-S has the potential to control infection at the site of inoculation, which should prevent both the clinical disease and transmission to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Jun-Guy Park; Fatai S.

208,Modular basis for potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by a prevalent VH1-2-derived antibody class,"Antibodies with heavy chains that derive from the VH1-2 gene constitute some of the most potent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies yet identified. To provide insight into whether these genetic similarities inform common modes of recognition, we determined structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with three VH1-2-derived antibodies: 2-15, 2-43, and H4. All three utilized VH1-2-encoded motifs to recognize the receptor-binding domain (RBD), with heavy chain N53I enhancing binding and light chain tyrosines recognizing F486RBD. Despite these similarities, class members bound both RBD-up and -down conformations of the spike, with a subset of antibodies utilizing elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343 on a neighboring RBD - a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD separation of up to 12 [A]. The VH1-2-antibody class thus utilizes modular recognition encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with VH-gene component specifying recognition of RBD and CDRH3 component specifying quaternary interactions.

209,Immunogenicity and efficacy of the COVID-19 candidate vector vaccine MVA SARS 2 S in preclinical vaccination,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as the infectious agent causing the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dramatic consequences for global human health and economics. Previously, we reached clinical evaluation with our vector vaccine based on vaccinia virus MVA against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes an infection in humans similar to SARS and COVID-19. Here, we describe the construction and preclinical characterization of a recombinant MVA expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-SARS-2-S). Genetic stability and growth characteristics of MVA-SARS-2-S, plus its robust synthesis of S antigen, make it a suitable candidate vaccine for industrial scale production. Vaccinated mice produced S antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and serum antibodies binding to S glycoprotein that neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Prime-boost vaccination with MVA-SARS-2-S protected mice sensitized with a human ACE2-expressing adenovirus from SARS-CoV-2 infection. MVA-SARS-2-S is currently being investigated in a phase I clinical trial as aspirant for developing a safe and efficacious vaccine against COVID-19.

Significance StatementThe highly attenuated vaccinia virus MVA is licensed as smallpox vaccine, and as vector it is a component of the approved Adenovirus-MVA-based prime-boost vaccine against Ebola virus disease. Here we provide results from testing the COVID-19 candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S, a poxvirus-based vector vaccine that proceeded to clinical evaluation. When administered by intramuscular inoculation, MVA-SARS-2-S expresses and safely delivers the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, inducing balanced SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity, and protective efficacy in vaccinated mice. Substantial clinical experience has already been gained with MVA vectors using homologous and heterologous prime-boost applications, including the immunization of children and immunocompromised individuals. Thus, MVA-SARS-2-S represents an important resource for developing further optimized COVID-19 vaccines.",Alina Tscherne; Jan Hendrik Schwarz; Cornelius Rohde; Alexandra Kupke; Georgia Kalodimou; Leonard Limpinsel; Nisreen M.A. Okba; Berislav Bosnjak; Inga Sandrock; Sandro Halwe; Lucie Sauerhering; Katrin Printz; Liangliang Nan; Elke Duell; Sylvia Jany; Astrid Freudenstein; Joerg Schmidt; Anke Werner; Michelle Gellhorn; Michael Kluever; Wolfgang Guggemos; Michael Seilmaier; Clemens Wendtner; Reinhold Foerster; Bart Haagmans; Stephan Becker; Gerd Sutter; Asisa Volz,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.426032,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.426032,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,False

These functions can be both beneficial (by clearing pathogens) and/or detrimental (by inducing inflammation). We tested the possibility that qualitative differences in SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody-mediated innate immune functions contribute to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. We found that antibodies from hospitalized COVID-19 patients elicited higher ADCD but lower ADCP compared to antibodies from non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Consistently, higher ADCD was associated with higher systemic inflammation during COVID-19.

Here we investigate whether intranasally administered ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 reduces shedding, using a SARS-CoV-2 virus with the D614G mutation in the spike protein. Viral load in swabs obtained from intranasally vaccinated hamsters was significantly decreased compared to controls and no viral RNA or infectious virus was found in lung tissue, both in a direct challenge and a transmission model. Intranasal vaccination of rhesus macaques resulted in reduced shedding and a reduction in viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage and lower respiratory tract tissue.

212,Impact of South African 501.V2 Variant on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Infectivity and Neutralization: A Structure-based Computational Assessment,"MotivationThe SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging from South Africa (501.V2) and the UK (B.1.1.7) necessitate rapid assessment of the effects of the corresponding amino acid substitutions in the spike (S) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the variants on the interactions with the human ACE2 receptor and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reported earlier to neutralize the spike.

ResultsMolecular modeling and simulations reveal that N501Y, shared by both variants, increases ACE2 binding affinity, and may impact the collective dynamics of the ACE2-RBD complex, occupying a central hinge site that modulates the overall dynamics of the complex. In contrast, the substitutions K417N and E484K in the South African variant 501.V2 would reduce the ACE2-binding affinity by abolishing two interfacial salt bridges that facilitate RBD binding to ACE2, K417(S)-D30(ACE2) and E484 (S)-K31(ACE2). These two mutations may thus be more than compensating the attractive effect induced by N501Y, overall resulting in an ACE2-binding affinity comparable to that of the wildtype RBD. Further analysis of the impact of these mutations on the interactions with mAbs targeting the spike indicate that the substitutions K417N and E484K may also abolish the salt bridges between the spike and selected mAbs, such as REGN10933, BD23, H11_H4, and C105, thus reducing the binding affinity and effectiveness of these mAbs.

The multifunctionality of this protein including host receptor binding and apoptosis has been proved in several coronaviruses. It also interacts with other viral proteins such as membrane (M) protein through its C-terminal domain. The specific dibasic motif signal present in cytosolic region at C-terminal of spike protein helps it to localize within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the structural conformation of cytosolic region is not known in SARS-CoV-2 using which it interacts with other proteins and transporting vesicles. Therefore, we have demonstrated the conformation of cytosolic region and its dynamics through computer simulations up to microsecond timescale using OPLS and CHARMM forcefields. The simulations have revealed the unstructured conformation of cytosolic region (residues 1242-1273). Also, in temperature dependent replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations it has shown to form secondary structures.

214,The hyperlipidaemic drug fenofibrate significantly reduces infection by SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a significant number of fatalities and worldwide disruption. To identify drugs to repurpose to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, we established a screen to measure dimerization of ACE2, the primary receptor for the virus. This screen identified fenofibric acid, the active metabolite of fenofibrate. Fenofibric acid also destabilized the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and inhibited RBD binding to ACE2 in ELISA and whole cell binding assays. Fenofibrate and fenofibric acid were tested by two independent laboratories measuring infection of cultured Vero cells using two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. In both settings at drug concentrations which are clinically achievable, fenofibrate and fenofibric acid reduced viral infection by up to 70%. Together with its extensive history of clinical use and its relatively good safety profile, these studies identify fenofibrate as a potential therapeutic agent requiring urgent clinical evaluation to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

216,The Conundrum of Giglio Island: unraveling the dynamics of an apparent resistance to COVID-19. A descriptive study,"ObjectivesDespite an extensive risk of exposure to COVID-19, the residents of Giglio Island, Italy, did not develop any symptom of SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to characterize the nature of exposure and to describe the local population dynamics underlying its apparent resistance to COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted seroprevalence screening from April 29 to May 3, 2020 across the three main settlements on the island. We invited the adult resident population, present on the island to undergo testing by rapid serologic assay and to provide a sample of saliva for molecular validation. We monitored the participation through the official municipality residents list. Serologic testing was performed using a COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test while molecular analyses were carried out by Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene).

ResultsA total of 634 residents out of 748 (84.8%) present at the time, and 89 non-residents underwent serological testing. 364 males and 359 females with a median age of 58.5 years. The serological screening identified one positive, asymptomatic subject. The Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests did not yield any positive result.

ConclusionDespite extensive exposure to SARS-CoV-2, only one new asymptomatic infection occurred in this population. This may be due to unknown protective factors or chance. On the basis of this first descriptive study, using its population as a reference model, further investigations will be conducted to characterize the summer period exposure and to test the advanced hypotheses, focusing on the evaluation of a possible cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 from exposure to endemic viruses.",Antonio Bognanni; Armando Schiaffino; Fulvia Pimpinelli; Sara Donzelli; Ilaria Celesti; Sabrina Strano; Elena Solari; Giorgia Schiaffino; Gabriele Solari; Domenico Solari; Serena Delbue; Marta Rigoni; Giandomenico Nollo; Greta Muti; Giovanna Muti Schunemann; Holger Schunemann; Giovanni Blandino; Aldo Morrone; Paola Muti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20248948,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20248948,2021-01-09,2021-01-09,,True
217,Cholinergic and lipid mediators crosstalk in Covid-19 and the impact of glucocorticoid therapy,"Cytokine storms and hyperinflammation, potentially controlled by glucocorticoids, occur in COVID-19; the roles of lipid mediators and acetylcholine (ACh) and how glucocorticoid therapy affects their release in Covid-19 remain unclear. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from SARS-CoV-2- and non-SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects were collected for metabolomic/lipidomic, cytokines, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and ACh, and CD14 and CD36-expressing monocyte/macrophage subpopulation analyses. Transcriptome reanalysis of pulmonary biopsies was performed by assessing coexpression, differential expression, and biological networks. Correlations of lipid mediators, sCD14, and ACh with glucocorticoid treatment were evaluated. This study enrolled 190 participants with Covid-19 at different disease stages, 13 hospitalized non-Covid-19 patients, and 39 healthy-participants. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased blood levels of arachidonic acid (AA), 5-HETE, 11-HETE, sCD14, and ACh but decreased monocyte CD14 and CD36 expression. 5-HETE, 11-HETE, cytokines, ACh, and neutrophils were higher in BAL than in circulation (fold-change for 5-HETE 389.0; 11-HETE 13.6; ACh 18.7, neutrophil 177.5, respectively). Only AA was higher in circulation than in BAL samples (fold-change 7.7). Results were considered significant at P<0.05, 95%CI. Transcriptome data revealed a unique gene expression profile associated with AA, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, ACh, and their receptors in Covid-19. Glucocorticoid treatment in severe/critical cases lowered ACh without impacting disease outcome. We first report that pulmonary inflammation and the worst outcomes in Covid-19 are associated with high levels of ACh and lipid mediators. Glucocorticoid therapy only reduced ACh, and we suggest that treatment may be started early, in combination with AA metabolism inhibitors, to better benefit severe/critical patients.",Malena M.

218,The Effect of Temperature on Covid-19 Confirmed Cases: Evidence from US Counties,"This paper studies the effect of air temperature on the transmission of COVID-19 in the U.S. using daily observations across counties. This study uses various ordinary least squares (OLS) models with a comprehensive set of fixed effects to overcome unobserved heterogeneity issues across counties as well as the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators as dynamic models to address endogeneity issue. Our main results indicate that an increase of one degree in temperature is associated with a reduction of 0.041 cases per 100,000 population at the county-level. We run several robustness tests and all the models confirm the impact of temperature on COVID-19 confirmed new cases. These results help policymakers and economists in optimizing decisions and investments to reduce COVID- 19 new cases.

ObjectiveTo determine the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-{beta}-1a, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir for improving the clinical, virological outcomes in COVID-19 inpatients.

DesignOpen-label, randomized, adaptive, controlled trial.

SettingMulti-center trial with patients from France.

Participants583 COVID-19 inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support

InterventionStandard of care (SoC, control), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir every 12h for 14 days), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-{beta}-1a (44 g of subcutaneous IFN-{beta}-1a on days 1, 3, and 6), SoC plus hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on day 1 then 400 mg once daily for 9 days) or SoC plus remdesivir (200 mg intravenously on day 1 then 100 mg once-daily for hospitalization duration or 10 days).

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 quantification in respiratory specimens and safety analyses.

ResultsAdjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for the WHO 7-point ordinal scale were not in favor of investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, aOR 0.83, 95%CI, 0.55 to 1.26, P=0.39; lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-{beta}-1a versus control, aOR 0.69, 95%CI, 0.45 to 1.04, P=0.08; hydroxychloroquine versus control, aOR 0.93, 95%CI, 0.62 to 1.41, P=0.75. No significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract was evidenced. Lopinavir/ritonavir-containing treatments were significantly associated with more SAE.

LimitationsNot a placebo-controlled, no anti-inflammatory agents tested.

ConclusionNo improvement of the clinical status at day 15 nor SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract specimens by studied drugs. This comforts the recent Solidarity findings.

220,Ivermectin as a potential treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19: A double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial,"ObjectiveIvermectin has been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19.This randomised control trial was conducted to test the efficacy of Ivermectin in the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19.

DesignParallel, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial Setting: A tertiary care dedicated COVID-19 hospital in Bihar, India

ParticipantsAdult patients (> 18 years) admitted with mild to moderate COVID 19 disease (saturation > 90% on room air, respiratory rate < 30 and no features of shock) with no contraindications to ivermectin and willing to participate in the study

InterventionPatients in the intervention arm were given ivermectin 12 mg on day 1 and day 2 of admission. Patients in the placebo arm were given identical looking placebo tablets. Rest of the treatment was continued as per the existing protocol and the clinical judgment of the treating teams.

Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome measure was a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 6 of admission. The secondary outcome measures were symptom status on day 6, discharge status on day 10, admission to ICU, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality.

ResultsA total of 115 patients were enrolled for the study of which 112 were included in the final analysis. Of them, 55 were randomised to the intervention arm while 57 were randomised to the placebo arm. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the two arms. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 between the two groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the two groups in most of the secondary outcome measures, viz. symptom status on day 6, discharge status on day 10, admission to ICU, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. However, while there was no in-hospital mortality in the intervention arm, there were 4 deaths in the placebo arm. As a result, all patients in the intervention arm (n=56) were successfully discharged as compared to 93.1% (n=54/58) in the placebo arm (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2, p=0.019).

ConclusionThere was no difference in the primary outcome i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 of admission with the use of ivermectin. However, a significantly higher proportion of patients were discharged alive from the hospital when they received ivermectin.

Strengths and Limitations of the StudyO_LIThis study was randomised and double blind, thereby minimizing the chance of bias.
C_LIO_LIAll outcome measures except symptom status on day 6 were objective and placebo control was used for comparison.
C_LIO_LIOnly single repeat RT-PCR was done. So median time to viral clearance in the two groups could not be calculated.
C_LIO_LISevere cases were not included in the study.

We have developed MassMark, a novel and highly scalable multiplex method that employs next generation sequencing for high-throughput, accurate and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, while minimizing handling complexity and resources by utilizing a serial pooling strategy to accommodate over 9,000 samples per workflow. Analytical validation showed that MassMark was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA down to a level of 100 copies per reaction. We evaluated the clinical performance of MassMark in a simulated screening testing with 22 characterized samples from three different sources (nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs and saliva), comprising of 12 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with mid to late Ct values (range: 22.98-32.72) and 10 negative samples.

222,COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers of a large COVID Hospital in Rome reveals strengths and limits of two different serological tests,"In several hospitals worldwide, healthcare workers are currently at the forefront against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli (FPG) IRCCS has been enlisted as a COVID hospital, healthcare workers deployed to COVID wards were separated from those with limited or no exposure, whereas administrative staff was destined to work-from-home.

Between June 4 and July 3 2020, an investigation was carried out to evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among employees of the FPG using point-of-care (POC) and venous blood tests. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were determined with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal/oropharyngeal swabs as gold standard.

Four thousand, seven hundred seventy-seven participants were enrolled. Seroprevalence was 3.66% using the POC test and 1.19% using venous blood test, with a significant difference between the two (p < 0.05).

POC sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 63.64% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.20% to 65.04%) and 96.64% (95% CI: 96.05% to 97.13%), while those of the venous blood test were, respectively, 78.79% (95% CI: 77.58% to 79.94%) and 99.36% (95% CI: 99.07% to 99.55%). Among low-risk population, point-of-cares predictive values were 58.33% (positive) and 98.23% (negative) whereas venous blood tests were 92.86% (positive) and 98.53% (negative).

223,Levels of SARS-CoV-2 population exposure are considerably higher than suggested by seroprevalence surveys,"Accurate knowledge of levels of prior population exposure will inform preparedness plans for subsequent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves and vaccination strategies. Serological studies can be used to estimate levels of past exposure and thus position populations in their epidemic timeline. To circumvent biases introduced by decaying antibody titers over time, population exposure estimation methods should account for seroreversion. Here, we present a new method that combines multiple datasets (serology, mortality, and virus positivity ratios) to estimate seroreversion time and infection fatality ratios and simultaneously infer population exposure levels. The results indicate that the average time to seroreversion is five months, meaning that true exposure may be more than double the current seroprevalence levels reported for several regions of England.

Existence of a forward bifurcation point is presented by deriving conditions in terms of parameters for the existence of disease free and endemic equilibrium points. The significance of having two additional compartments, viz., protective and hospital quarantine compartments, is then illustrated via numerical simulations. From the analysis and results, it is observed that, by properly selecting transfer functions to place exposed and infected individuals in protective and hospital quarantine compartments, respectively, and with apt governmental action, it is possible to contain the COVID-19 spread effectively.

Here, we report a genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in 48 raw wastewater samples collected from three wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland between July 9 and December 21, 2020. We find evidence for the presence of several mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages in some of the samples, including co-occurrences of up to three B.1.1.7 signature mutations on the same amplicon in four samples from Lausanne and one sample from a Swiss ski resort dated December 9 - 21. These findings suggest that the B.1.1.7 strain could be detected by mid December, two weeks before its first verification in a patient sample from Switzerland.

We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, with a standardized propolis product (EPP-AF) on hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. Patients received standard care plus propolis at an oral dose of 400mg/day (n=40) or 800mg/day (n=42) for seven days, or standard care alone (n=42). Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Time in the hospital after intervention was significantly shortened in both propolis groups compared to the controls; median 7 days with 400mg/day and 6 days with 800mg/day, versus 12 days for standard care alone. Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. With the higher dose, significantly fewer patients developed acute kidney injury than in the controls (2 versus 10 of 42 patients).

However, the fight against the pandemic is far from over. Here, we propose an age-structured compartmental model to study the interplay of disease transmission, vaccines rollout, and behavioural dynamics. We investigate, via in-silico simulations, individual and societal behavioural changes, possibly induced by the start of the vaccination campaigns, and manifested as a relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We calibrate the model using real epidemiological data for three different countries: Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. We explore different vaccination rollout speeds, prioritization strategies, and vaccine efficacy as well as multiple behavioural responses. Our findings suggest that early relaxation of safe behaviours can jeopardize the benefits brought by the vaccine in the short term: a fast vaccine distribution and policies aimed at keeping high compliance of individual safe behaviours are key to mitigate disease resurgence.",Nicolò Gozzi; Paolo Bajardi; Nicola Perra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249480,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249480,2021-01-09,2021-01-09,,True

ObjectivesWe aim to identify the causes of occupational stress and burnout in women in medicine, nursing, and other health professions during the COVID-19 pandemic and interventions that can support female health professionals deal with this crisis through a rapid review.

MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC from December 2019 through September 30, 2020. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO and is available online. We selected all empirical studies that discussed stress and burnout in women health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ResultsThe literature search identified 6148 citations. A review of abstracts led to the retrieval of 721 full-text articles for assessment, of which 47 articles were included for review. Our findings show that concerns of safety (65%), staff and resource adequacy (43%), workload and compensation (37%), job roles and security (41%) appeared as common triggers of stress in the literature.

229,Deep learning-based detection of COVID-19 using wearables data,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that is primarily diagnosed using laboratory tests, which are frequently not administered until after symptom onset. However, SARS-CoV-2 is contagious multiple days before symptom onset and diagnosis, thus enhancing its transmission through the population.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, we collected 15 seconds to one-minute heart rate and steps interval data from Fitbit devices during the COVID-19 period (February 2020 until June 2020). Resting heart rate was computed by selecting the heart rate intervals where steps were zero for 12 minutes ahead of an interrogated time point. Data for each participant was divided into train or baseline by taking the days before the non-infectious period and test data by taking the days during the COVID-19 infectious period. Data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training days. Here, we developed a deep learning approach based on a Long Short-Term Memory Networks-based autoencoder, called LAAD, to predict COVID-19 infection by detecting abnormal resting heart rate in test data relative to the users baseline.

FindingsWe detected an abnormal resting heart rate during the period of viral infection (7 days before the symptom onset and 21 days after) in 92% (23 out of 25 cases) of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. In 56% (14) of cases, LAAD detection identified cases in their pre-symptomatic phase whereas 36% (9 cases) were detected after the onset of symptoms with an average precision score of 0{middle dot}91 (SD 0{middle dot}13, 95% CI 0{middle dot}854-0{middle dot}967), a recall score of 0{middle dot}36 (0{middle dot}295, 0{middle dot}232-0{middle dot}487), and a F-beta score of 0{middle dot}79 (0{middle dot}226, 0{middle dot}693-0{middle dot}888). In COVID-19 positive patients, abnormal RHR patterns start 5 days before symptom onset (6{middle dot}9 days in pre-symptomatic cases and 1{middle dot}9 days later in post-symptomatic cases). COVID-19+ patients have longer abnormal resting heart rate periods (89 hours or 3{middle dot}7 days) as compared to healthy individuals (25 hours or 1{middle dot}1 days).

InterpretationThese findings show that deep learning neural networks and wearables data are an effective method for the early detection of COVID-19 infection. Additional validation data will help guide the use of this and similar techniques in real-world infection surveillance and isolation policies to reduce transmission and end the pandemic.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSCOVID-19 resulted in up to 1{middle dot}7 million deaths worldwide in 2020. COVID-19 detection using laboratory tests is usually performed after symptom onset. This delay can allow the spread of viral infection and can cause outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar for research articles published in English up to Dec 1, 2020, using common search terms including ""COVID-19 and wearables"", ""Resting heart rate and viral infection"", ""Resting heart rate and COVID-19"", ""machine learning and COVID-19"" and ""deep-learning and COVID-19"". Previous studies have attempted to use an elevated resting heart rate as an indicator of viral infection. Although these studies have investigated the early prediction of COVID-19 using resting heart rate and other wearables data, studies to investigate a deep learning-based prediction model with performance evaluation metrics at the user level has not been reported.

Added value of this studyIn this study, we created a deep-learning system that used wearables data such as abnormal resting heart rate to predict COVID-19 before the symptom onset. The deep-learning system was created using retrospective time-series datasets collected from 25 COVID-19+ patients, 11 non-COVID-19, and 70 healthy individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first deep-learning model to identify an early viral infection using wearables data at the user level. This study also greatly extends our previous phase-1 study and factors unpredictable behavior and time-series nature of the data, limited data size, and lack of data labels to evaluate performance metrics. The use of a real-time version of this model using more data along with user feedback may help to scale early detection as the number of patients with COVID-19 continues to grow.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn the future, wearable devices may provide high-resolution sleep, temperature, saturated oxygen, respiration rate, and electrocardiogram, which could be used to further characterize an individuals baseline and improve the deep-learning model performance for infectious disease detection. Using multi-sensor data with a real-time deep-learning model has the potential to alert individuals of illness prior to symptom onset and may greatly reduce the viral spread.",Gireesh K Bogu; Michael P Snyder,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249474,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249474,2021-01-09,2021-01-09,,True
230,The incremental value of computed tomography of COVID-19 pneumonia in predicting ICU admission,"RationaleTriage is crucial for patients management and estimation of the required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds is fundamental for Health Systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo assess whether chest Computed Tomography (CT) of COVID-19 pneumonia has an incremental role in predicting patients admission to ICU.

MethodsWe performed volumetric and texture analysis of the areas of the affected lung in CT of 115 outpatients with COVID-19 infection presenting to the Emergency Room with dyspnea and unresponsive hypoxyemia. Admission blood laboratory including lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and C-Reactive Protein and the ratio between the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and inspired oxygen were collected. By calculating the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC), we compared the performance of blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone and combined with the CT features in two hybrid models (Hybrid radiological and Hybrid radiomics)for predicting ICU admission. Following a machine learning approach, 63 patients were allocated to the training and 52 to the validation set.

Measurements and Main ResultsTwenty-nine (25%) of patients were admitted to ICU. The Hybrid radiological model comprising the lung %consolidation performed significantly (p=0.04) better in predicting ICU admission in the validation (AUC=0.82; 95%Confidence Interval 0.68-0.95) set than the blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone (AUC=0.71; 95%Confidence Interval 0.56-0.86). A risk calculator for ICU admission was derived and is available at:https://github.com/cgplab/covidapp

231,"Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of COVID-19, co-reporting of common outcomes from the PAN-COVID and AAP SONPM registry","BackgroundFew large, cohort studies report data on individuals maternal, fetal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. We report outcomes from a collaboration formed early during the pandemic between the investigators of two registries, the UK and global Pregnancy and Neonatal outcomes in COVID-19 (PAN-COVID) study and the US American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine (AAP SONPM) National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry.

MethodsPAN-COVID (suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage in pregnancy) and the AAP SONPM registry (positive maternal testing for SARS-CoV-2 from 14 days before delivery to 3 days after delivery) studies collected data on maternal, fetal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. PAN-COVID results are presented as all inclusions and those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection only.

ResultsWe report 4004 women in pregnancy affected by suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (1606 from PAN-COVID and 2398 from the AAP SONPM) from January 1st 2020 to July 25th 2020 (PAN-COVID) and August 8th (AAP SONPM). For obstetric outcomes in PAN-COVID and AAP SONPM, respectively, maternal death occurred in 0.5% and 0.17%, early neonatal death in 0.2% and 0.3%, and stillbirth in 0.50% and 0.65% of women. Delivery was pre-term (<37 weeks gestation) in 12% of all women in PAN-COVID, in 16.2% of those women with confirmed infection in PAN-COVID and 16.2% of women in AAP SONPM. Very preterm delivery (< 27 weeks gestation) occurred in 0.6% in PAN-COVID and 0.7% in AAP SONPM.

Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in 0.8% of PAN-COVID all inclusions, 2.0% in PAN-COVID confirmed infections and 1.8% in the AAP SONPM study; the proportions of babies tested were 9.5%, 20.7% and 87.2% respectively.

The proportion of SGA babies was 8.2% in PAN-COVID all inclusions, 9.7% in PAN-COVID confirmed infection and 9.6% in AAP SONPM. Gestational age adjusted mean z-scores were -0.03 for PAN-COVID and -0.18 for AAP SONPM.

ConclusionsThe findings from the UK and US SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy registries were remarkably concordant. Pre-term delivery affected a higher proportion of women in pregnancy than expected from historical and contemporaneous national data. The proportions of women affected by stillbirth, small for gestational age infants and early neonatal death were comparable to historical and contemporaneous UK and US data. Although maternal death was uncommon, the proportion was higher than expected from UK and US population data, likely explained by under-ascertainment of women affected by milder and asymptomatic infection in pregnancy. The data presented support strong guidance for enhanced precautions to prevent SARS-COV-2 infection in pregnancy, particularly in the context of increased risks of preterm delivery and maternal mortality, and for priority vaccination of women planning pregnancy.

What is known about SARS-COV-2 infection in pregnancy and neonates?Cohort, population surveillance studies and living systematic reviews have included limited numbers of women in pregnancy affected by COVID-19 and report that most women and infants had good outcomes.

What this study addsPreterm deliveries occurred in a high proportion of women participating in these two registries in comparison to contemporaneous and historical national data in the UK and US. The majority of preterm deliveries occurred late preterm (between 32+0 and 36+6 weeks gestation).

SARS-COV-2 infection in pregnancy did not appear to be associated with a clinically significant effect on the rate of stillbirth, fetal growth, or neonatal outcomes.

232,Zorro versus Covid-19: fighting the pandemic with face masks,"To confront the global Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the spread of the virus, we need to better understand if face mask use is effective to contain the outbreak and investigate the potential drivers in favor of mask adoption. It is highly questionable since there is no consensus among the general public despite official recommendations. For the first time, we conduct a panel econometric exercise to assess the dynamic impact of face mask use on both infected cases and fatalities at a global scale. We reveal a negative impact of mask wearing on fatality rates and on the Covid-19 number of infected cases. The delay of action varies from around 7 days to 28 days concerning infected cases but is more longer concerning fatalities. We also document the increasing adoption of mask use over time. We find that population density and pollution levels are significant determinants of heterogeneity regarding mask adoption across countries, while altruism, trust in government and demographics are not. Surprisingly, government effectiveness and income level (GDP) have an unexpected influence. However, strict government policies against Covid-19 have the most significant effect on mask use. Therefore, the most effective way of increasing the level of mask wearing is to enforce strict laws on the wearing of masks.",Olivier DAMETTE,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.20237578,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.20237578,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
233,COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test at hospital admission associated to the knowledge of individual risk factors allow overcoming the difficulty of managing suspected patients in hospitals,"Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to limiting the spread of the virus and managing infected patients during hospitalization. The sensitivity of RT-qPCR is contested by the fact that it is time-consuming, executed by trained technicians in proper environment for material extraction. Here, we evaluated the first SARS-CoV-2 antigen test recommended by the World Health Organization at September, 2020 as an alternative for immediate diagnosis of symptomatic and suspected patients at a hospital in Brazil during the epidemic peak. All patients were submitted to RT-qPCR and rapid antigen test using nasopharyngeal swabs rigorously collected at the same time. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, symptoms and outcomes were considered. Prediction analysis revealed that previous stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, desaturation and tachypnea were the most relevant determinants of the death of COVID-19 patients. Comparison between the rapid antigen test and RT-qPCR revealed an overall PPV of 97%, extended to 100% when performed between 4 and 15 days of symptoms, with an accuracy of 90-91% from days 1 to 7 and a  Substantial agreement. The rapid antigen test presented no inconclusive result. Among the discordant results and RT-qPCR inconclusives, 72% presented bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities on imaging and other exams alterations. The median time to obtain RT-qPCR results was 83.6 hours, against 15 minutes for the rapid test, precious time for deciding on patient isolation and management.

234,"Mobilefuge: A low-cost, portable, open source, 3D-printed centrifuge that can be used for purification of saliva samples for SARS-CoV2 detection","One of the best ways to contain the spread of COVID-19 is frequent testing of as many people as possible and timely isolation of uninfected personnel from infected personnel. However, the cost of massive testing is affordable in many countries. The existing technologies might not be scalable to offer affordable testing for millions of people. To address this issue, novel testing methods based on Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) were proposed that are more sensitive, require less reagents and can work with saliva samples instead of more tedious nasal swabs. As a result, LAMP based protocols can make it possible to drive the cost down to one dollar per test. These LAMP based methods require a centrifuge device, mostly for separation of viral particles from reaction inhibitors in saliva samples. However, centrifuge is neither accessible nor affordable in many resource limited settings, especially during this pandemic situation when normal supply chains are heavily disrupted. To overcome these challenges, we invented a low-cost centrifuge that can be useful for carrying out low-cost LAMP based detection of SARS-Cov2 virus in saliva. The 3D printed centrifuge (Mobilefuge) is portable, robust, stable, safe, easy to build and operate. The Mobilefuge doesnt require soldering or programming skills and can be built without any specialised equipment, yet practical enough for high throughput use. More importantly, Mobilefuge can be powered from widely available USB ports, including mobile phones and associated power supplies. This allows the Mobilefuge to be used even in off-grid and resource limited settings. We believe that our invention will aid the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 by lowering the costs of testing equipment. Apart from the COVID-19 testing, the Mobilefuge can have applications in the field of biomedical research and diagnostics.",Mohini Bhupathi; Ganga Chinna Rao Devarapu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249280,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249280,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
235,Evaluation of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in utero: nine pregnant women and their newborns,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), mainly transmitted by droplets and close contact, has caused a pandemic worldwide as of November 2020. According to the current case reports and cohort studies, the symptoms of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to normal adults and may cause a series of adverse consequences of pregnancy (placental abruption, fetal distress, epilepsy during pregnancy, etc.). However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to the fetus through the placental barrier is still a focus of debate.

MethodsIn this study, in order to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 infect fetus through placental barrier, we performed qualitative detection of virus structural protein (spike protein and nucleoprotein) and targeted receptor protein (ACE2, CD147 and GRP78) expression on the placental tissue of seven pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 through immunohistochemistry. Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were collected immediately in the operating room for verification after delivery, which were all tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

ResultsThe result showed that CD147 was expressed on the basal side of the chorionic trophoblast cell membrane and ACE2 was expressed on the maternal side, while GRP78 was strongly expressed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. The RT-PCR results of Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were all negative.

ConclusionsWe believed that despite the detection of viral structural proteins in the placenta, SARS-CoV-2 cannot be transmitted to infants due to the presence of the placental barrier.

In order to provide further understanding of the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in these settings, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on samples obtained from 8 selected outbreaks in Minnesota from March - June, 2020. WGS and phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 319 samples, constituting 14.4% of the 2,222 total SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals associated with these outbreaks. Among the sequenced specimens, three LTCFs and both correctional facilities had spread associated with a single genetic sequence. A fourth LTCF had outbreak cases associated with two distinct sequences. In contrast, cases associated with outbreaks in the two meat processing plants represented multiple SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These results suggest that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into a facility can result in a widespread outbreak, and early identification and cohorting of cases, along with continued vigilance with infection prevention and control measures is imperative.",Nicholas B Lehnertz; Xiong Wang; Jacob Garfin; Joanne Taylor; Jennifer Zipprich; Brittany VonBank; Karen Martin; Dana Eikmeier; Carlota Medus; Brooke Wiedinmyer; Carmen Bernu; Matthew Plumb; Kelly Pung; Margaret A Honein; Rosalind Carter; Duncan MacCannell; Kirk E.

237,"Host genome analysis of structural variations by Optical Genome Mapping provides clinically valuable insights into genes implicated in critical immune, viral infection, and viral replication pathways in patients with severe COVID-19.","BackgroundThe varied clinical manifestations and outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections implicate a role of host-genetics in the predisposition to disease severity. This is supported by evidence that is now emerging, where initial reports identify common risk factors and rare genetic variants associated with high risk for severe/ life-threatening COVID-19. Impressive global efforts have focused on either identifying common genetic factors utilizing short-read sequencing data in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or whole-exome and genome studies to interrogate the human genome at the level of detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short indels. However, these studies lack the sensitivity to accurately detect several classes of variants, especially large structural variants (SVs) including copy number variants (CNVs), which account for a substantial proportion of variation among individuals. Thus, we investigated the host genomes of individuals with severe/life-threatening COVID-19 at the level of large SVs (500bp-Mb level) to identify events that might provide insight into the inter-individual clinical variability in clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsOptical genome mapping using Bionanos Saphyr(R) system was performed on thirty-seven severely ill COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). To extract candidate SVs, three distinct analyses were undertaken. First, an unbiased whole-genome analysis of SVs was performed to identify rare/unique genic SVs in these patients that did not appear in population datasets to determine candidate loci as decisive predisposing factors associated with severe COVID-19. Second, common SVs with a population frequency filter was interrogated for possible association with severe COVID-19 based on literature surveys. Third, genome-wide SV enrichment in severely ill patients versus the general population was investigated by calculating odds ratios to identify top-ranked genes/loci. Candidate SVs were confirmed using qPCR and an independent bioinformatics tool (FaNDOM).

ResultsOur patient-centric investigation identified 11 SVs involving 38 genes implicated in three key host-viral interaction pathways: (1) innate immunity and inflammatory response, (2) airway resistance to pathogens, and (3) viral replication, spread, and RNA editing. These included seven rare/unique SVs (not present in the control dataset), identified in 24.3% (9/37) of patients, impacting up to 31 genes, of which STK26 and DPP4 are the most promising candidates. A duplication partially overlapping STK26 was corroborated with data showing upregulation of this gene in severely ill patients. Further, using a population frequency filter of less than 20% in the Bionano control dataset, four SVs involving seven genes were identified in 56.7% (21/37) of patients.

ConclusionThis study is the first to systematically assess and highlight SVs potential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 severity. The genes implicated here identify novel SVs, especially STK26, and extend previous reports involving innate immunity and type I interferon response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our study also shows that optical genome mapping can be a powerful tool to identify large SVs impacting disease outcomes with split survival and add valuable genomic information to the existing sequencing-based technology databases to understand the inter-individual variability associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality.",Nikhil Sahajpal; Chi-Yu Jill Lai; Alex Hastie; Ashis K Mondal; Siavash Raeisi Dehkordi; Cas van der Made; Olivier Fedrigo; Farooq Al-Ajli; Sawan Jalnapurkar; Rashmi Kanagal-Shamanna; Brynn Levy; Silviu-Alin Bacanu; Michael C Zody; Catherine A.

238,IL-2 and IFN- are biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular response in whole blood stimulation assays,"A proper description of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for the assessment of protection elicited after both infection and vaccination. Uncoupled T and B cell responses have been described in acute and convalescent patients and exposed individuals. We assessed the potential usefulness of whole blood stimulation assays to identify functional cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Blood from COVID-19 recovered individuals (5 months after infection) and negative subjects was stimulated for 24 hours with HLA predicted peptide ""megapools"" of the Spike and Nucleoprotein, or the mixture of them. After stimulation, cytokines were quantified using a beads-based multiplex assay. Interleukin-2 and IFN-{gamma} were found to be specific biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 cellular response. Using the Spike and Nucleoprotein mixture, 91.3% of COVID-19 recovered individuals presented an IL-2 stimulation index over the cut-off, while 82.6% showed IFN-{gamma}. All the negative individuals presented an IL-2 response under the cut-off, while 5.3% of these subjects presented positive IFN-{gamma} stimulation indexes. Moreover, IL-2 production correlated with IgG levels for Spike 1, RBD, and Nucleocapsid.

239,"Integrated Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions based Strategies in Ontario, Canada, as a Case Study: a Mathematical Modeling Study","BackgroundRecently, two ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) vaccine products have been authorized in Canada. It is of crucial importance to model an integrated/combined package of non-pharmaceutical (physical/social distancing) and pharmaceutical (immunization) public health control measures.

MethodsA modified epidemiological, compartmental SIR model was utilized and fit to the cumulative COVID-19 case data for the province of Ontario, Canada, from September 8, 2020 to December 8, 2020. Different vaccine roll-out strategies were simulated until 75 percent of the population is vaccinated, including a no-vaccination scenario. We compete these vaccination strategies with relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were supposed to remain enforced and began to be relaxed on either January 31, March 31, or May 1, 2021.

ResultsBased on projections from the data and long-term extrapolation of scenarios, relaxing the public health measures implemented by re-opening too early would cause any benefits of vaccination to be lost by increasing case numbers, increasing the effective reproduction number above 1 and thus increasing the risk of localized outbreaks. If relaxation is, instead, delayed and 75 percent of the Ontarian population gets vaccinated by the end of the year, re-opening can occur with very little risk.

InterpretationRelaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions by re-opening and vaccine deployment is a careful balancing act. Our combination of model projections from data and simulation of different strategies and scenarios, can equip local public health decision- and policy-makers with projections concerning the COVID-19 epidemiological trend, helping them in the decision-making process.",Matthew Betti; Nicola Bragazzi; Jane Heffernan; Jude Dvezela Kong; Angie Raad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249272,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249272,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
240,Identifying silent COVID-19 infections among children is critical for controlling the pandemic,"ImportanceA significant proportion of COVID-19 transmission occurs silently during the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic stages of infection. Children, while being important drivers of silent transmission, are not included in COVID-19 vaccination campaigns given their exclusion from clinical trials thus far.

ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of a targeted approach to identifying silent infections among children as a proxy for their vaccination.

DesignThis study used an age-structured disease transmission model to simulate the synergistic impact of interventions in reducing attack rates over the course of one year.

SettingA synthetic population representative of the demographics of the United States (US).

ParticipantsSix age groups of 0-4, 5-10, 11-18, 19-49, 50-64, 65+ years old, stratified for their population size based on US census data.

ExposuresVaccination of adults, self-isolation of all symptomatic cases within 24 hours of symptom onset, and detection of silent infections.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresVaccination of adults was implemented to reach a 40% coverage over the course of one year with a vaccine efficacy of 95% against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. Without vaccination of children, we determined the proportion and speed that would be required for identifying silent infections among this age group to suppress future attack rates below 5%.

ResultsA targeted approach that identifies 20.6% and 28.6% of silent infections among children within 2 or 3 days post-infection, respectively, would be required to bring attack rates under 5% with vaccination of adults. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rates would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (at least 82%) of this age group, in addition to the base-case 40% vaccination coverage of adults. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses with respect to vaccine efficacy against infection and reduced susceptibility of children to infection.

Conclusions and RelevanceIn the absence of vaccine availability for children, a targeted approach to rapid identification of silent COVID-19 infections in this age group can significantly mitigate disease burden. Without measures to interrupt transmission chains from silent infections, vaccination of adults is unlikely to contain the outbreaks in the near term.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the impact of a targeted strategy for identification of silent COVID-19 infections among children in the absence of their vaccination?

FindingsIn this modelling study, we found that identifying 20-30% of silent infections among children within three days post-infection would bring attack rates below 5% if only adults were vaccinated. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rate would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (at least 82%) of this age group, in addition to vaccination of adults.

241,OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory 1: describing trends and variation in primary care clinical activity for 23.3 million patients in England during the first wave of COVID-19,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare activity globally. The NHS in England stopped most non-urgent work by March 2020, but later recommended that services should be restored to near-normal levels before winter where possible. The authors are developing the OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory, using data to describe changes in service activity during COVID-19, and reviewing signals for action with commissioners, researchers and clinicians. Here we report phase one: generating, managing, and describing the data.

ObjectiveTo describe the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in English primary care across 23.8 million patients records, taking respiratory disease and laboratory procedures as key examples.

MethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England we developed an open source software framework for data management and analysis to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across primary care EHR data on 23.8 million patients; and conducted a population cohort-based study to describe activity using CTV3 coding hierarchy and keyword searches from January 2019-September 2020.

ResultsMuch activity recorded in general practice declined to some extent during the pandemic, but largely recovered by September 2020, with some exceptions. There was a large drop in coded activity for commonly used laboratory tests, with broad recovery to pre-pandemic levels by September. One exception was blood coagulation tests such as International Normalised Ratio (INR), with a smaller reduction (median tests per 1000 patients in 2020: February 8.0; April 6.2; September 7.0). The overall pattern of recording for respiratory symptoms was less affected, following an expected seasonal pattern and classified as ""no change"" from the previous year. Respiratory tract infections exhibited a sustained drop compared with pre-pandemic levels, not returning to pre-pandemic levels by September 2020. Various COVID-19 codes increased through the period. We observed a small decline associated with high level codes for long-term respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Asthma annual reviews experienced a small drop but since recovered, while COPD annual reviews remain below baseline.

ConclusionsWe successfully delivered an open source software framework to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across an unprecedented scale of primary care data. The COVD-19 pandemic led to a substantial change in healthcare activity. Most laboratory tests showed substantial reduction, largely recovering to near-normal levels by September 2020, with some important tests less affected. Records of respiratory infections decreased with the exception of codes related to COVID-19, whilst activity of other respiratory disease codes was mixed.

242,Clinical Validation of a Novel T-cell Receptor Sequencing Assay for Identification of Recent or Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"BackgroundWhile diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine development in the COVID-19 pandemic has proceeded at unprecedented speed and scale, critical gaps remain in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Current diagnostic strategies, including serology, have numerous limitations in addressing these gaps. Here we describe clinical performance of T- Detect COVID, the first reported assay to determine recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and immune repertoire profiling from whole blood samples.

MethodsMethods for high-throughput immunosequencing of the TCR{beta} gene from blood specimens have been described1. We developed a statistical classifier showing high specificity for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection2, utilizing >4,000 SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR sequences from 784 cases and 2,447 controls across 5 independent cohorts. The T-Detect COVID Assay comprises immunosequencing and classifier application to yield a qualitative positive or negative result. Several retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled to assess assay performance including primary and secondary Positive Percent Agreement (PPA; N=205, N=77); primary and secondary Negative Percent Agreement (NPA; N=87, N=79); PPA compared to serology (N=55); and pathogen cross-reactivity (N=38).

ResultsT-Detect COVID demonstrated high PPA in subjects with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (97.1% 15+ days from diagnosis; 94.5% 15+ days from symptom onset), high NPA ([~]100%) in presumed or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative cases, equivalent or higher PPA than two commercial EUA serology tests, and no evidence of pathogen cross-reactivity.

ConclusionT-Detect COVID is a novel T-cell immunosequencing assay demonstrating high clinical performance to identify recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection from standard blood samples. This assay can provide critical insights on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response, with potential implications for clinical management, risk stratification, surveillance, assessing protective immunity, and understanding long-term sequelae.",Sudeb C.

243,SARS-CoV-2 patient self-testing with an antigen-detecting rapid test: a head-to-head comparison with professional testing,"BackgroundAntigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) have been widely recommended as a complement to RT-PCR. Considering the possibility of nasal self-sampling and the ease-of-use in performing the test, self-testing may be an option.

Methods and FindingsWe performed a manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study of nasal mid-turbinate self-sampling and self-testing when using a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. Symptomatic participants suspected to have COVID-19 received written and illustrated instructions. Procedures were observed without intervention. For comparison, Ag-RDTs with nasopharyngeal sampling were professionally performed. Estimates of agreement, sensitivity, and specificity relative to RT-PCR on a combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sample were calculated. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires.

Among 146 symptomatic adults, 40 (27.4%) were RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sensitivity with self-testing was 82.5% (33/40 RT-PCR positives detected; 95% CI 68.1-91.3), and 85.0% (34/40; 95% CI 70.9-92.9) with professional testing. The positive percent agreement between self-testing and professional testing on Ag-RDT was 91.4% (95% CI 77.6-97.0), and negative percent agreement 99.1% (95% CI 95.0-100). At high viral load (>7.0 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml), sensitivity was 96.6% (28/29; 95% CI 82.8-99.8) for both self- and professional testing. Deviations in sampling and testing (incomplete self-sampling or extraction procedure, or imprecise volume applied on the test device) were observed in 25 out of the 40 PCR-positives. Participants were rather young (mean age 35 years) and educated (59.6% with higher education degree). Most participants (80.9%) considered the Ag-RDT as rather easy to perform.

ConclusionsAmbulatory participants suspected for SARS-CoV-2 infection were able to reliably perform the Ag-RDT and test themselves. Procedural errors might be reduced by refinement of the Ag-RDTs for self-testing, such as modified instructions for use or product design/procedures. Self-testing may result in more wide-spread and more frequent testing. Paired with the appropriate information and education of the general public about the benefits and risks, self-testing may therefore have significant impact on the pandemic.",Andreas K.

244,Inherent random fluctuations in COVID-19 outbreaks may explain rapid growth of new mutated virus variants,"A new virus variant of SARS-COV-2 has had a profound impact on society while governments have taken action to limit its impacts by enforcing lockdowns and limiting spread from the UK to other countries. Variants with mutations in the virus genome are likely to occur, but do not always associate to significant changes in the biology of the virus, or the disease. For the variant VOC 202012/01 (also referred to as B.1.1.7), however, preliminary reports indicate it may be more transmissible. Here we use a simulation model calibrated to the inherent random fluctuating transmission pattern of COVID-19 to investigate what the probability may be for detecting more transmissible virus variants post facto. We find that post facto identification of successful virus variants of SARS-COV-2 are likely to exhibit growth rates that are substantially larger than the average growth rate. This finding has implications for interpreting growth rate and transmissibility of new virus variants.",Kenneth Bodin; Joacim Rocklov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249353,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249353,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
245,"Modeling the effect of vaccination strategies in an Excel spreadsheet: The rate of vaccination, and not only the vaccination coverage, is a determinant for containing COVID-19 in urban areas","We have investigated the importance of the rate of vaccination to contain COVID-19 in urban areas. We used an extremely simple epidemiological model that is amenable to implementation in an Excel spreadsheet and includes the demographics of social distancing, efficacy of massive testing and quarantine, and coverage and rate of vaccination as the main parameters to model the progression of COVID-19 pandemics in densely populated urban areas. Our model predicts that effective containment of pandemic progression in densely populated cities would be more effectively achieved by vaccination campaigns that consider the fast distribution and application of vaccines (i.e., 50% coverage in 6 months) while social distancing measures are still in place. Our results suggest that the rate of vaccination is more important than the overall vaccination coverage for containing COVID-19. In addition, our modeling indicates that widespread testing and quarantining of infected subjects would greatly benefit the success of vaccination campaigns. We envision this simple model as a friendly, readily accessible, and cost-effective tool for assisting health officials and local governments in the rational design/planning of vaccination strategies.",Mario Moises Alvarez; Sergio Bravo-Gonzalez; Grissel Trujillo-de Santiago,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249365,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249365,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
246,Optimal design for phase 2 studies of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs,"There is no agreed methodology for pharmacometric assessment of candidate antiviral drugs in COVID-19. The most widely used measure of virological response in clinical trials so far is the time to viral clearance assessed by qPCR of viral nucleic acid in eluates from serial nasopharyngeal swabs. We posited that the rate of viral clearance would have better discriminatory value. Using a pharmacodynamic model fit to individual SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance data from 46 uncomplicated COVID-19 infections in a cohort of prospectively followed adults, we simulated qPCR viral load data to compare type 2 errors when using time to clearance and rate of clearance under varying antiviral effects, sample sizes, sampling frequencies and durations of follow-up. The rate of viral clearance is a uniformly superior endpoint as compared to time to clearance with respect to type 2 error, and it is not dependent on initial viral load or assay sensitivity. For greatest efficiency pharmacometric assessments should be conducted in early illness and daily qPCR samples should be taken over 7 to 10 days in each patient studied. Adaptive randomisation and early stopping for success permits more rapid identification of active interventions.",James A Watson; Stephen Kissler; Nicholas PJ Day; Yonatan H.

We conducted a pilot study in 100 patients to test the hypothesis that RBC EPA+DHA levels (the Omega-3 Index, O3I) would be inversely associated with risk for death by analyzing the O3I in banked blood samples drawn at hospital admission. To have adequate power (>80%) in this pilot study, we pre-specified a significance level of 0.10. Fourteen patients died, one of 25 in quartile 4 (Q4) (O3I [&ge;]5.7%) and 13 of 75 in Q1-3. After adjusting for age and sex, the odds ratio for death in patients with an O3I in Q4 vs Q1-3 was 0.25, p=0.07. Thus, we have suggestive evidence that the risk for death from COVID-19 was lower in those with the highest O3I levels.

Using data on all US counties on a daily basis over the year 2020 and applying a rich panel data fixed effect model, we document that: 1) there are discernible social and demographic disparities in the spread of Covid-19. Blacks, low educated, and poorer people are at higher risks of being infected by the new disease. 2) The criteria pollutants including Ozone, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 have the potential to accelerate the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. 3) The disadvantaged population is more vulnerable to the effects of pollution on the spread of coronavirus. Specifically, the effects of pollution on confirmed cases become larger for blacks, low educated, and counties with lower average wages in 2019.",Osvalso Allen; Ava Brown; Ersong Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249303,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249303,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True

We integrate these results into a stochastic compartmental model to show that COVID-19 impacts were also fat tailed for many large U.S. cities for several weeks in the spring and summer.

At the antigen level, the mutations only substantially reduced signal in 0.5% of the population. Although some epitope mutations reduce measured signal in up to 6% of the population, these are not the dominant epitopes for their antigens.

252,"Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics, and Virologic Features of COVID-19 Patients in Kazakhstan: a Nation-Wide, Retrospective, Cohort Study.","BackgroundThe earliest coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases in Central Asia were announced in March 2020 by Kazakhstan. Despite the implementation of aggressive measures to curb infection spread, gaps remain in the understanding of the clinical and epidemiologic features of the regional pandemic.

MethodsWe did a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Kazakhstan between February and April 2020. We compared demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data of patients with different COVID-19 severities on admission. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with disease severity and death. Whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 analysis was performed in 53 patients without a recent history of international travel.

FindingsOf the 1072 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in March-April 2020, the median age was 36 years (IQR 24-50) and 484 (45%) were male. On admission, 683 (64%) participants had mild, 341 (32%) moderate, and 47 (4%) severe-to-critical COVID-19 manifestation; 20 deaths (1.87%) were reported at study exit. Multivariable regression indicated increasing odds of severe disease associated with older age (odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07, per year increase; p<0.001), the presence of comorbidities (2.13, 95% CI 1.07-4.23; p<0.031) and elevated white blood cell count (WBC, 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.28; p<0.032) on admission, while older age (1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.12, per year increase; p<0.001) and male sex (5.97, 95% CI 1.95-18.32; p<0.002) were associated with increased odds of death. The Kazakhstan SARS-CoV-2 isolates grouped into seven distinct lineages O/B.4.1, S/A.2, S/B.1.1, G/B.1, GH/B.1.255, GH/B.1.3 and GR/B.1.1.10.

InterpretationOlder age, comorbidities, increased WBC count, and male sex were risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and mortality in Kazakhstan. The broad SARS-CoV-2 diversity suggests multiple importations and community-level amplification, likely predating the declaration of state emergency.

253,Multi-organ complement deposition in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundIncreased levels of circulating complement activation products have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but only limited information is available on complement involvement at tissue level. The mechanisms and pathways of local complement activation remain unclear.

MethodsWe performed immunofluorescence analyses of autopsy specimens of lungs, kidney and liver from nine COVID-19 patients who died of acute respiratory failure. Snap-frozen samples embedded in OCT were stained with antibodies against complement components and activation products, IgG and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

FindingsLung deposits of C1q, C4, C3 and C5b-9 were localized in the capillaries of the interalveolar septa and on alveolar cells. IgG displayed a similar even distribution, suggesting classical pathway activation. The spike protein is a potential target of IgG, but its uneven distribution suggests that other viral and tissue molecules may be targeted by IgG. Factor B deposits were also seen in COVID-19 lungs and are consistent with activation of the alternative pathway, whereas MBL and MASP-2 were hardly detectable. Analysis of kidney and liver specimens mirrored findings observed in the lung. Complement deposits were seen on tubules and vessels of the kidney with only mild C5b-9 staining in glomeruli, and on hepatic artery and portal vein of the liver.

InterpretationComplement deposits in different organs of deceased COVID-19 patients caused by activation of the classical and alternative pathways support the multi-organ nature of the disease.

254,Recurrent dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 through the Uruguayan-Brazilian border,"BackgroundUruguay is one of the few countries in the Americas that successfully contained the COVID-19 epidemic during the first half of 2020. Nevertheless, the intensive human mobility across the dry border with Brazil is a major challenge for public health authorities. We aimed to investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in Uruguayan localities bordering Brazil as well as to measure the viral flux across this [~]1,100 km uninterrupted dry frontier.

MethodsUsing complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Uruguayan-Brazilian bordering region and phylogeographic analyses, we inferred the virus dissemination frequency between Brazil and Uruguay and characterized local outbreak dynamics during the first months (May-July) of the pandemic.

FindingsPhylogenetic analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 into Uruguayan localities at the bordering region. The most probable sources of viral strains introduced to Uruguay were the Southeast Brazilian region and the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Some of the viral strains introduced in Uruguayan border localities between early May and mid-July were able to locally spread and originated the first outbreaks detected outside the metropolitan region. The viral lineages responsible for Uruguayan suburban outbreaks were defined by a set of between four and 11 mutations (synonymous and non-synonymous) respect to the ancestral B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 viruses that arose in Brazil, supporting the notion of a rapid genetic differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 subpopulations spreading in South America.

InterpretationAlthough Uruguayan borders have remained essentially closed to non-Uruguayan citizens, the inevitable flow of people across the dry border with Brazil allowed the repeated entry of the virus into Uruguay and the subsequent emergence of local outbreaks in Uruguayan border localities. Implementation of coordinated bi-national surveillance systems are crucial to achieve an efficient control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread across this kind of highly permeable borderland regions around the world.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), was first detected in South America on February 26, 2020, it has rapidly spread through the region, causing nearly 350,000 deaths by December, 2020. In contrast to most American countries, Uruguay avoided an early exponential growth of SARS-CoV-2 cases and during the first six months of the pandemic it registered the lowest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths among South American countries. The intensive cross-border human mobility through the [~]1,100 km uninterrupted dry frontier between Uruguay and Brazil, might poses a major challenge for long-term control of the epidemic in Uruguay. Previous genomic studies conducted in Uruguay have analyzed sequences mostly sampled at the capital city, Montevideo, and detected prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages different from those described in Brazil, thus finding no evidence of frequent viral exchanges between these countries.

Added value of this studyHere we present the first genomic study of SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in different Uruguayan and Brazilian localities along the bordering region. The samples analyzed include 30% (n = 59) of all laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases from Uruguayan departments at the Brazilian border between March and July, 2020, as well as 68 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from individuals diagnosed in the southernmost Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul between March and August, 2020. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 viral lineages that widely spread in the Southeastern Brazilian region (B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33) were also responsible for most viral infections in Rio Grande do Sul and neighboring Uruguayan localities. We further uncover that major outbreaks detected in Uruguayan localities bordering Brazil in May and June, 2020, were originated from two independent introduction events of the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.33, unlike previous outbreaks in the Uruguayan metropolitan region that were seeded by European SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings confirm that although Uruguayan borders have remained essentially closed to non-Uruguayan citizens, dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 across the Uruguayan-Brazilian frontier was not fully suppressed and had the potential to ignite local transmission chains in Uruguay. These findings also highlight the relevance of implementing bi-national public health cooperation workforces combining epidemiologic and genomic data to monitor the viral spread throughout this kind of highly permeable dry frontiers around the world.",Daiana Mir; Natalia Rego; Paola Cristina Resende; Fernando Lopez-Tort; Tamara Fernandez-Calero; Veronica Noya; Mariana Brandes; Tania Possi; Mailen Arleo; Natalia Reyes; Matias Victoria; Andres Lizasoain; Matias Castells; Leticia Maya; Matias Salvo; Tatiana Schaffer Gregianini; Marilda Tereza Mar da Rosa; Leticia Garay Martins; Cecilia Alonso; Yasser Vega; Cecilia Salazar; Ignacio Ferres; Jose Sotelo; Jose Sotelo; Pablo Smircich; Cecilia Matho; Ighor Arantes; Luciana Appolinario; Ana Carolina Mendonca; Maria Jose Benitez-Galeano; Martin Grana; Camila Simoes; Fernando Motta; Marilda Mendonca Siqueira; Gonzalo Bello; Rodney Colina; Lucia Spangenberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.20249026,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.20249026,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True

Materials and MethodsWe provide the abnormality annotations in frontal CXRs by creating bounding boxes. The frontal CXRs are a part of the existing BIMCV-COVID19+ database. We also define four different protocols for robust evaluation of semantic segmentation and classification algorithms. Finally, we benchmark the defined protocols and report the results using popular deep learning models as a part of this study.

ResultsFor semantic segmentation, Mask-RCNN performs the best among all the models with a DICE score of 0.43 {+/-} 0.01. For classification, we observe that MobileNetv2 yields the best results for 2-class and 3-class classification. We also observe that deep models report a lower performance for classifying other classes apart from the COVID class.

ConclusionBy making the annotated data and protocols available to the scientific community, we aim to advance the usage of CXRs as a viable solution for efficient COVID-19 diagnostics. This large-scale data will be useful for ML algorithms and can be used for learning radiological patterns observed in COVID-19 patients.

MethodsThis is a case series of student-athletes at a single NCAA Division I institution who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody testing (IgG) from 4/15/2020 to 10/31/2020. From 452 athletes who were screened, 5,124 PCR and 452 antibody tests were completed. Student-athletes were followed through 12/31/2020 (median 104 days, range 64-182 days). Cardiac work-up included clinical evaluation, troponin level, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram. Additional work-up was ordered as clinically indicated.

Results55 student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 38 (69%) had symptoms of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), 14 (26%) had a positive IgG test, and 41 (74%) had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, while the remaining six had normal cardiac MRIs.

ConclusionThese data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of cardiovascular testing for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Continued follow-up of these athletes for sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 is critical.",Calvin E Hwang; Andrea Kussman; Jeffrey W Christle; Victor Froelicher; Matthew T Wheeler; Kegan J Moneghetti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249407,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249407,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
258,Analysis of Intervention Effectiveness Using Early Outbreak Transmission Dynamics to Guide Future Pandemic Management and Decision-Making in Kuwait,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a World Health Organization designated pandemic that can result in severe symptoms and death that disproportionately affects older patients or those with comorbidities. Kuwait reported its first imported cases of COVID-19 on February 24, 2020. Analysis of data from the first three months of community transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important guidance for decision-making when dealing with future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave management. The analysis of intervention scenarios can help to evaluate the possible impacts of various outbreak control measures going forward which aim to reduce the effective reproduction number during the initial outbreak wave. Herein we use a modified susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-infectious-removed (SEAIR) transmission model to estimate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait. We fit case data from the first 96 days in the model to estimate the basic reproduction number and used Google mobility data to refine community contact matrices. The SEAIR modelled scenarios allow for the analysis of various interventions to determine their effectiveness. The model can help inform future pandemic wave management, not only in Kuwait but for other countries as well.",Michael G.

259,High prevalence of long-term psychophysical olfactory dysfunction in patients with COVID-19,"This study prospectively assessed the long-term prevalence of self-reported and psychophysically measured olfactory dysfunction in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Self-reported smell or taste impairment was prospectively evaluated by SNOT-22 at diagnosis, 4-week, 8-week, and 6-month. At 6 months from the diagnosis, psychophysical evaluation of olfactory function was also performed using the 34-item culturally adapted University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (CA-UPSIT). 145 completed both the 6-month subjective and psychophysical olfactory evaluation. According to CA-UPSIT, 87 subjects (60.0%) exhibited some smell dysfunction, with 54 (37.2) being mildly microsmic, 16 (11.0%) moderately microsmic, 7 (4.8%) severely microsmic, and 10 patients (6.9%) being anosmic. At the time CA-UPSIT was administered, a weak correlation was observed between the self-reported alteration of sense of smell or taste and olfactory test scores (Spearmans r=-0.26). Among 112 patients who self-reported normal sense of smell at last follow-up, CA-UPSIT revealed normal smell in 46 (41.1%), mild microsmia in 46 (41.1%), moderate microsmia in 11 (9.8%), severe microsmia in 3 (2.3%), and anosmia in 6 (5.4%) patients; however, of those patients self-reporting normal smell but who were found to have hypofunction on testing, 62 out of 66 had self-reported reduction in sense of smell or taste at an earlier time point. Despite most patients report a subjectively normal sense of smell, we observed a high percentage of persistent smell dysfunction at 6 months from the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 11.7% of patients being anosmic or severely microsmic. These data highlight a significant long-term rate of smell alteration in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Paolo Boscolo-Rizzo; Anna Menegaldo; Cristoforo Fabbris; Giacomo Spinato; Daniele Borsetto; Luigi Angelo Vaira; Leonardo Calvanese; Andrea Pettorelli; Massimo Sonego; Daniele Frezza; Andy Bertolin; Walter Cestaro; Roberto Rigoli; Giancarlo Tirelli; Maria Cristina Da Mosto; Anna Menini; Jerry Polesel; Claire Hopkins,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249406,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249406,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
260,Ultrasensitive RNA biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a simple color and luminescence assay,"The COVID-19 pandemic underlines the need for versatile diagnostic strategies. Here, we have designed and developed toehold RNA-based sensors for direct and ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. In our assay, isothermal amplification of a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA coupled with activation of our biosensors leads to a conformational switch in the sensor. This leads to translation of a reporter-protein e.g. LacZ or Nano-lantern that is easily detected using color/luminescence. This response can be visualized by the human eye, or a simple cell phone camera as well as quantified using a spectrophotometer/luminometer.

By optimizing RNA-amplification and biosensor-design, we have generated a highly-sensitive diagnostic assay; with sensitivity down to attomolar (100 copies of) SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Finally, the biosensor efficiently detects the presence of viral RNA in human patient samples, with clear distinction from samples designated negative for the virus. The biosensor response correlates well with Ct values from RT-qPCR tests and thus presents a powerful and easily accessible strategy for detecting Covid infection.",Anirudh Chakravarthy; Anirudh K N; Geen George; Shyamsundar Ranganathan; Nishan Shettigar; Suchitta U; Dasaradhi Palakodeti; Akash Gulyani; Arati Ramesh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249426,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249426,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
261,Comparing the age and sex trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 morbidity with other respiratory pathogens points to potential immune mechanisms.,"Comparing age and sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and mortality with influenza and other health outcomes opens the way to generating hypotheses as to the underlying mechanisms, building on the extraordinary advances in immunology and physiology that have occurred over the last year. Notable departures in health outcomes starting around puberty suggest that burdens associated with influenza and other causes are reduced relative to the two emergent coronaviruses over much of adult life. Two possible hypotheses could explain this: protective adaptive immunity for influenza and other infections, or greater sensitivity to immunosenescence in the coronaviruses. Comparison of sex differences suggest an important role for adaptive immunity; but immunosenescence might also be relevant, if males experience faster immunosenescence. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin-system in SARS-CoV-2 infection might drive high sensitivity to disruptions of homeostasis. Overall, these results highlight the long tail of vulnerability in the age profile relevant to the emergent coronaviruses, which more transmissible variants have the potential to uncover at the younger end of the scale, and aging populations will expose at the other end of the scale.",C.

262,Predicting severity of Covid-19 using standard laboratory parameters,"BackgroundMore than 1.6 million people have already deceased due to a COVID-19 infection making it a major public health concern. A prediction of severe courses can enhance treatment quality and thus lower fatality and morbidity rates. The use of laboratory parameters has recently been established for a prediction. However, laboratory parameters have rarely been used in combination to predict severe outcomes.

MethodWe used a retrospective case-control design to analyze risk factors derived from laboratory parameters. Patients treated for COVID-19 at an hospital in Krefeld, Germany, from March to May 2020 were included (n =42). Patients were classified into two categories based on their outcome (Mild course vs. treatment in intensive care unit). Laboratory parameters were compared across severity categories using non-parametric statistic. Identified laboratory parameters were used in a logistic regression model. The model was replicated using a) clinical standardized parameters b) aggregated factors derived from a factor analysis.

ResultsPatients in intensive care unit showed elevated ALT, CRP and LDH levels, a higher leukocyte and neutrophile count, a higher neutrophile ratio and a lowered lymphocyte ratio. We were able to classify 95.1% of all cases correctly (96.6% of mild and 91.7% of severe cases, p<.001).

ConclusionA number of routinely collected laboratory parameters is associated with a severe outcome of COVID-19. The combination of these parameters provides a powerful tool in predicting severity and can enhance treatment effectiveness.",Thimo Buchmueller; Ingmar Groening; Ralf Ihl,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249392,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249392,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
263,Competing Health Risks Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic and Response: A Scoping Review,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a global public health threat with infections recorded in nearly every country. Responses to COVID-19 have varied in intensity and breadth, but generally have included domestic and international travel limitations, closure of non-essential businesses, and repurposing of health services. While these interventions have focused on testing, treatment, and mitigation of COVID-19, there have been reports of interruptions to diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services for other public health threats. We conducted a scoping review to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, and malnutrition.

MethodsA scoping literature review was completed using searches of PubMed and preprint servers (medRxiv/bioRxiv) from January 1st to October 31st, 2020, using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 and HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, and malnutrition. Empiric studies reporting original data collection and mathematical models were included, and available data synthesized by region. Studies were excluded if they were not written in English.

ResultsA total of 1604 published papers and 205 preprints met inclusion criteria, including 8.2% (132/1604) of published studies and 10.2% (21/205) of preprints: 7.3% (68/931) on HIV, 7.1% (24/339) on tuberculosis, 11.6% (26/224) on malaria, 7.8% (13/166) on sexual and reproductive health, and 12.1% (16/132) on malnutrition. Thematic results were similar across competing health risks, with substantial indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response on diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, and malnutrition.

DiscussionCOVID-19 emerged in the context of existing public health threats that result in millions of deaths every year. Thus, effectively responding to COVID-19 while minimizing the negative impacts of COVID-19 necessitates innovation and integration of existing programs that are often siloed across health systems. Inequities have been a consistent driver of existing health threats; COVID-19 has worsened disparities, reinforcing the need for programs that address structural risks. Data reviewed here suggest that effective strengthening of health systems should include investment in public health with adequate funding to ensure continuity of care for emergent and existing public health threats.",Stefan D.

264,Epidemiological differences in the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States and China,"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to forecast the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States (US) and China, two countries at different epidemic phases.

MethodsA mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression was used to investigate vaccine impact. Impact was assessed both for a vaccine that prevents infection (VES = 95%) and a vaccine that prevents only disease (VEP = 95%).

ResultsFor VES = 95% and gradual easing of restrictions, vaccination in the US reduced the peak incidence of infection, disease, and death by >55% and cumulative incidence by >32%, and in China by >77% and >65%, respectively. Nearly three vaccinations were needed to avert one infection in the US, but only one was needed in China. For VEP = 95%, benefits of vaccination were half those for VES = 95%. In both countries, the impact of vaccination was substantially enhanced with rapid scale-up, vaccine coverage >50%, and slower or no easing of restrictions, particularly in the US.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccination can flatten, delay, and/or prevent future epidemic waves. However, vaccine impact is destined to be heterogeneous across countries because of an underlying ""epidemiologic inequity"" that reduces benefits for countries already at high incidence, such as the US. Despite 95% efficacy, actual vaccine impact could be meager in such countries, if vaccine scale-up is slow, acceptance of the vaccine is poor, or restrictions are eased prematurely.

265,Timeliness of U.S. mortality data releases during the COVID-19 pandemic: delays are associated with electronic death registration system and elevated weekly mortality,"All-cause mortality counts allow public health authorities to identify populations experiencing excess deaths from pandemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies. Further, delays in mortality reporting may contribute to misinformation because death counts take weeks to become accurate. We estimate the timeliness of all-cause mortality releases during the Covid-19 pandemic, and identify potential reasons for reporting delays, using 35 weeks of provisional mortality counts between April 3 and December 4, 2020 for 52 states/jurisdictions. On average, states mortality counts are delayed by 5.6 weeks (standard deviation 1.74), with a range of 8.8 weeks between the fastest state and the slowest state. States that hadnt adopted the electronic death registration system were about 4 weeks slower, and 100 additional weekly deaths per million were associated with 0.4 weeks delays, but the residual standard deviation was 0.9 weeks, suggesting other sources of delay. Disaster planning should include improving the timeliness of mortality data.",Janet E Rosenbaum; Marco Stillo; Nathaniel Graves; Roberto Rivera,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249401,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249401,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
266,A two-phase stochastic dynamic model for COVID-19 mid-term policy recommendations in Greece: a pathway towards mass vaccination,"From November 7th, 2020, Greece adopted a second nationwide lockdown policy to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the first took place from March 23rd till May 4th, 2020), just as the second wave of COVID-19 was advancing, as did other European countries. In the light of the very promising voluntary mass vaccination, which will start in January 2021, it is of utmost importance for the country to plan to complement vaccination with mid-term Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). The objective is to minimize human losses and to limit social and economic costs. In this paper a two-phase stochastic dynamic network compartmental model (a pre-vaccination SEIR until February 15th, 2021 and a post-vaccination SVEIR from February 15th, 2021 to June 30th, 2021) is developed. Three scenarios are assessed in the first phase: (a) a baseline scenario, which lifts the national lockdown and all NPIs on January 2021, (b) a ""semi-lockdown"" scenario with school opening, partial retail sector operation, universal mask wearing and social distancing/teleworking on January 2021 and (c) a ""rolling lockdown"" scenario combining a partial lifting of measures in January 2021 followed by a third imposed nationwide lockdown in February 2021. In the second phase three scenarios with different vaccination rates are assessed. Publicly available data along with some preliminary first results of the SHARE COVID-19 survey conducted in Greece are used as input. The results regarding the first phase indicate that the ""semi-lockdown"" scenario outperforms the third lockdown scenario (5.7% less expected fatalities), whereas in the second phase it is of great importance to ensure a sufficient vaccine supply and high vaccination rates.",Nikolaos P.

267,Fibrinolysis influences SARS-CoV-2 infection in ciliated cells,"Rapid spread of COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented pandemic worldwide, and an inserted furin site in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) may account for increased transmissibility. Plasmin, and other host proteases, may cleave the furin site of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and {gamma} subunits of epithelial sodium channels ({gamma} ENaC), resulting in an increment in virus infectivity and channel activity. As for the importance of ENaC in the regulation of airway surface and alveolar fluid homeostasis, whether SARS-CoV-2 will share and strengthen the cleavage network with ENaC proteins at the single-cell level is urgently worthy of consideration. To address this issue, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) datasets, and found the PLAU (encoding urokinase plasminogen activator), SCNN1G ({gamma}ENaC), and ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) were co-expressed in alveolar epithelial, basal, club, and ciliated epithelial cells. The relative expression level of PLAU, TMPRSS2, and ACE2 were significantly upregulated in severe COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines using Seurat and DESeq2 R packages. Moreover, the increments in PLAU, FURIN, TMPRSS2, and ACE2 were predominately observed in different epithelial cells and leukocytes. Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2 may share and strengthen the ENaC fibrinolytic proteases network in ACE2 positive airway and alveolar epithelial cells, which may expedite virus infusion into the susceptible cells and bring about ENaC associated edematous respiratory condition.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425801,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425801,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,False
268,Vimentin binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies targeting extracellular vimentin block in vitro uptake of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles,"Infection of human cells by pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, typically proceeds by cell surface binding to a crucial receptor. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a necessary receptor, but not all ACE2-expressing cells are equally infected, suggesting that other extracellular factors are involved in host cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that is increasingly recognized as being present on the extracellular surface of a subset of cell types, where it can bind to and facilitate pathogens cellular uptake. Here, we present evidence that extracellular vimentin might act as a critical component of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex in mediating SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. We demonstrate direct binding between vimentin and SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and show that antibodies against vimentin block in vitro SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-expressing cell lines. Our results suggest new therapeutic strategies for preventing and slowing SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on targeting cell host surface vimentin.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425793,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425793,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,False
269,Neutralizing antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain isolated from a naïve human antibody library,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust antibody responses in some patients, with a majority of the response directed at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike surface glycoprotein. Remarkably, many patient-derived antibodies that potently inhibit viral infection harbor few to no mutations from the germline, suggesting that naive antibody libraries are a viable means for discovery of novel SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Here, we used a yeast surface-display library of human naive antibodies to isolate and characterize three novel neutralizing antibodies that target the RBD: one that blocks interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and two that target other epitopes on the RBD. These three antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus with IC50 values as low as 60 ng/mL in vitro. Using a biolayer interferometry-based binding competition assay, we determined that these antibodies have distinct but overlapping epitopes with antibodies elicited during natural COVID-19 infection. Taken together, these analyses highlight how in vitro selection of naive antibodies can mimic the humoral response in vivo, yielding neutralizing antibodies and various epitopes that can be effectively targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.",Benjamin Nikola Bell; Abigail E.

270,Artemisia annua L. extracts prevent in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) globally has infected and killed millions of people. Besides remdesivir, there are no approved small molecule-based therapeutics. Here we show that extracts of the medicinal plant, Artemisia annua L., which produces the antimalarial drug artemisinin, prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. We measured antiviral activity of dried leaf extracts of seven cultivars of A. annua sourced from four continents. Hot-water leaf extracts based on artemisinin, total flavonoids, or dry leaf mass showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 0.1-8.7 M, 0.01-0.14 g, and 23.4-57.4 g, respectively. One sample was >12 years old, but still active. While all hot water extracts were effective, concentrations of artemisinin and total flavonoids varied by nearly 100-fold in the extracts and antiviral efficacy was inversely correlated to artemisinin and total flavonoid contents. Artemisinin alone showed an estimated IC50 of about 70 M, and antimalarial artemisinin derivatives artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were ineffective or cytotoxic at elevated micromolar concentrations. In contrast, the antimalarial drug amodiaquine had an IC50 = 5.8 M. The extracts had minimal effects on infection of Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells by a reporter virus pseudotyped by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There was no cytotoxicity within an order of magnitude of the antiviral IC90 values. Results suggest the active component in the extracts is likely something besides artemisinin or is a combination of components acting synergistically to block post-entry viral infection. Further studies will determine in vivo efficacy to assess whether A. annua might provide a cost-effective therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.",Manoj S Nair; Yaoxing Huang; David A Fidock; Stephen J Polyak; Jessica Wagoner; Melissa Towler; Pamela Weathers,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425825,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425825,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,False
271,Ad26.COV2.S-elicited immunity protects against G614 spike variant SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters and does not enhance respiratory disease in challenged animals with breakthrough infection after sub-optimal vaccine dosing,"Previously we have shown that a single dose of recombinant adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vaccine expressing a prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen (Ad26.COV2.S) is immunogenic and provides protection in Syrian hamster and non-human primate SARS-CoV-2 infection models. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity, protective efficacy and potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) mediated by Ad26.COV2.S in a moderate disease Syrian hamster challenge model, using the currently most prevalent G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 variant. Vaccine doses of 1x109 vp and 1x1010 vp elicited substantial neutralizing antibodies titers and completely protected over 80% of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated Syrian hamsters from lung infection and pneumonia but not upper respiratory tract infection. A second vaccine dose further increased neutralizing antibody titers which was associated with decreased infectious viral load in the upper respiratory tract after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Suboptimal non-protective immune responses elicited by low-dose A26.COV2.S vaccination did not exacerbate respiratory disease in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated Syrian hamsters with breakthrough infection. In addition, dosing down the vaccine allowed to establish that binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlate with lower respiratory tract protection probability. Overall, these pre-clinical data confirm efficacy of a 1-dose vaccine regimen with Ad26.COV2.S in this G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 virus variant Syrian hamster model, show the added benefit of a second vaccine dose, and demonstrate that there are no signs of VAERD under conditions of suboptimal immunity.",Joan E.M. van der Lubbe; Sietske K.

272,Inflight Transmission of COVID-19 Based on Aerosol Dispersion Data,"BackgroundAn issue of concern to the travelling public is the possibility of in-flight transmission of COVID-19 during long- and short-haul flights. The aviation industry maintain the probability of contracting the illness is small based on reported cases, modelling and data from aerosol dispersion experiments conducted on-board aircraft.

MethodsUsing experimentally derived aerosol dispersion data for a B777-200 aircraft and a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation we estimate inflight infection probability for a range of scenarios involving quanta generation rate and face mask efficiency. Quanta generation rates were selected based on COVID-19 events reported in the literature while mask efficiency was determined from the aerosol dispersion experiments.

ResultsThe MID-AFT cabin exhibits the highest infection probability. The calculated maximum individual infection probability (without masks) for a 2-hour flight in this section varies from 4.5% for the ""Mild Scenario"" to 60.2% for the ""Severe Scenario"" although the corresponding average infection probability varies from 0.1% to 2.5%. For a 12-hour flight, the corresponding maximum individual infection probability varies from 24.1% to 99.6% and the average infection probability varies from 0.8% to 10.8%. If all passengers wear face masks throughout the 12-hour flight, the average infection probability can be reduced by approximately 73%/32% for high/low efficiency masks. If face masks are worn by all passengers except during a one-hour meal service, the average infection probability is increased by 59%/8% compared to the situation where the mask is not removed.

273,A Multiple Linear Regression Analysis of Rural-Urban COVID-19 Risk Disparities in Texas,"As the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. rises, the differential impact of the pandemic in urban and rural regions becomes more pronounced, and the major factors relating to this difference remain unclear. Using the 254 counties of Texas as units of analysis, we utilized multiple linear regression to investigate the influence of 83 county-level predictor variables including race demographics, age demographics, healthcare and financial status, and prevalence of and mortality rate from COVID-19 risk factors on the incidence rate and case fatality rate from COVID-19 in Texas on September 15, 2020. Here, we report that urban counties experience, on average, 41.1% higher incidence rates from COVID-19 than rural counties and 34.7% lower case fatality rates. Through comparisons between our models, we found that this difference was largely attributable to four major predictor variables: namely, the proportion of elderly residents, African American residents, and Hispanic residents, and the presence of large nursing homes. According to our models, counties with high incidence rates of COVID-19 are predicted to have high proportions of African American residents and Hispanic residents coupled with low proportions of elderly residents. Furthermore, we found that counties with the highest case fatality rates are predicted to have high proportions of elderly residents, obese residents, and Hispanic residents, coupled with low proportions of residents ages 20-39 and residents who report smoking cigarettes. In our study, major variables and their effects on COVID-19 risk are quantified, highlighting the most vulnerable populations and regions of Texas.",Amber K.

274,Protection against reinfection with D614- or G614-SARS-CoV-2 isolates in hamsters,"Reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have already been documented in humans, although its real incidence is currently unknown. Besides having great impact on public health, this phenomenon raises the question if immunity generated by a single infection is sufficient to provide sterilizing/protective immunity to a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. The Golden Syrian hamster is a manageable animal model to explore immunological mechanisms able to counteract COVID-19, as it recapitulates pathological aspects of mild to moderately affected patients. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2-inoculated hamsters resolve infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts within seven days upon inoculation with the Cat01 (G614) SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Three weeks after primary challenge, and despite high titers of neutralizing antibodies, half of the animals were susceptible to reinfection by both identical (Cat01, G614) and variant (WA/1, D614) SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, upon re-inoculation, only nasal tissues were transiently infected with much lower viral replication than those observed after the first inoculation. These data indicate that a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is not sufficient to elicit a sterilizing immunity in hamster models but protects against lung disease.",Marco Brustolin; Jordi Rodon; Maria Luisa Rodriguez de la Concepcion; Carlos Avila-Nieto; Guillermo Cantero; Monica Perez; Te Nigeer; Marc Noguera-Julian; Victor Guallar; Alfonso Valencia; Nuria Roca; Nuria Izquierdo-Useros; Julia Blanco; Bonaventura Clotet; Albert Bensaid; Jorge Carrillo; Julia Vergara-Alert; Joaquim Segales,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425729,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425729,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
275,New targets for drug design: Importance of nsp14/nsp10 complex formation for the 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic activity on SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has triggered a global pandemic with devastating consequences for health-care and social-economic systems. Thus, the understanding of fundamental aspects of SARS-CoV-2 is of extreme importance.

In this work, we have focused our attention on the viral ribonuclease (RNase) nsp14, since this protein was considered one of the most interferon antagonists from SARS-CoV-2, and affects viral replication. This RNase is a multifunctional protein that harbors two distinct activities, an N-terminal 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), both with critical roles in coronaviruses life cycle. Namely, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN knockout mutants are non-viable, indicating nsp14 as a prominent target for the development of antiviral drugs.

Nsp14 ExoN activity is stimulated through the interaction with the nsp10 protein, which has a pleiotropic function during viral replication. In this study, we have performed the first biochemical characterization of the complex nsp14-nsp10 from SARS-CoV-2. Here we confirm the 3-5 exoribonuclease and MTase activities of nsp14 in this new Coronavirus, and the critical role of nsp10 in upregulating the nsp14 ExoN activity in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 N7-MTase activity is functionally independent of the ExoN activity. The nsp14 MTase activity also seems to be independent of the presence of nsp10 cofactor, contrarily to nsp14 ExoN.

Until now, there is no available structure for the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex. As such, we have modelled the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex based on the 3D structure of the complex from SARS-CoV (PDB ID 5C8S). We also have managed to map key nsp10 residues involved in its interaction with nsp14, all of which are also shown to be essential for stimulation of the nsp14 ExoN activity. This reinforces the idea that a stable interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is strictly required for the nsp14-mediated ExoN activity of SARS-CoV-2, as observed for SARS-CoV.

We have studied the role of conserved DEDD catalytic residues of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN. Our results show that motif I of ExoN domain is essential for the nsp14 function contrasting to the functionality of these conserved catalytic residues in SARS-CoV, and in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). The differences here revealed can have important implications regarding the specific pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

The nsp10-nsp14 interface is a recognized attractive target for antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. This work has unravelled a basis for discovering inhibitors targeting the specific amino acids here reported, in order to disrupt the assembly of this complex and interfere with coronaviruses replication.",Margarida Saramago; Cátia Bárria; Vanessa Costa; Caio S.

Rapid development and deployment of safe and effective vaccines are imperative to control the pandemic. In the current study, we applied our adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-2P)-based vaccine, MVC-COV1901, to hamster models to demonstrate immunogenicity and protection from virus challenge. Golden Syrian hamsters immunized intramuscularly with two injections of 1 {micro}g or 5 {micro}g of S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) were challenged intranasally with SARS-CoV-2. Prior to virus challenge, the vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies with 10,000-fold higher IgG level and an average of 50-fold higher pseudovirus neutralizing titers in either dose groups than vehicle or adjuvant control groups. Six days after infection, vaccinated hamsters did not display any weight loss associated with infection and had significantly reduced lung pathology and most importantly, lung viral load levels were reduced to lower than detection limit compared to unvaccinated animals. Vaccination with either 1 g or 5 g of adjuvanted S-2P produced comparable immunogenicity and protection from infection.

277,Genetic Characteristics and Phylogeny of 969-bp S Gene Sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from Hawaii Reveals the Worldwide Emerging P681H Mutation,"COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the world, caused over 1.8 million deaths in the first year, and severely affected the global economy. Hawaii is not spared from the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the local population, including high infection rates in racial and ethnic minorities. Early in the pandemic, we described in this journal various technologies used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Herein we characterize a 969-bp SARS-CoV-2 segment of the S gene downstream of the receptor-binding domain. At the John A. Burns School of Medicine Biocontainment Facility, RNA was extracted from an oropharyngeal swab and a nasal swab from two patients from Hawaii who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. Following PCR, the two viral strains were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGAX. Phylogenetic tree results indicate that the virus has been introduced to Hawaii from multiple sources. Further, we decoded 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 13 unique SARS-CoV-2 genomes within this region of the S gene, with one non-synonymous mutation (P681H) found in the two Hawaii strains. The P681H mutation has unique and emerging characteristics with a significant exponential increase in worldwide frequency when compared to the plateauing of the now universal D614G mutation. The P681H mutation is also characteristic of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom and Nigeria. Additionally, several mutations resulting in cysteine residues were detected, potentially resulting in disruption of the disulfide bridges in and around the receptor-binding domain. Targeted sequence characterization is warranted to determine the origin of multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Hawaii.",David P Maison; Lauren L Ching; Cecilia M Shikuma; Vivek R Nerurkar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425497,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425497,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
278,Molecular dynamics simulations and functional studies reveal that hBD-2 binds SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and blocks viral entry into ACE2 expressing cells,"New approaches to complement vaccination are needed to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and stop COVID-19 related deaths and long-term medical complications. Human beta defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a naturally occurring epithelial cell derived host defense peptide that has antiviral properties. Our comprehensive in-silico studies demonstrate that hBD-2 binds the site on the CoV-2-RBD that docks with the ACE2 receptor. Biophysical and biochemical assays confirm that hBD-2 indeed binds to the CoV-2-receptor binding domain (RBD) (KD [~] 300 nM), preventing it from binding to ACE2 expressing cells. Importantly, hBD-2 shows specificity by blocking CoV-2/spike pseudoviral infection, but not VSV-G mediated infection, of ACE2 expressing human cells with an IC50 of 2.4{+/-} 0.1 M. These promising findings offer opportunities to develop hBD-2 and/or its derivatives and mimetics to safely and effectively use as novel agents to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Liqun Zhang; Santosh K Ghosh; Shrikanth C Basavarajappa; Jeannine Muller-Greven; Jackson Penfield; Ann Brewer; Parameswaran Ramakrishnan; Matthias Buck; Aaron Weinberg,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425621,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425621,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
279,Comprehensive comparison of transcriptomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection: alternative entry routes and innate immune responses,"The pathogenesis of COVID-19 emerges as complex, with multiple factors leading to injury of different organs. Several studies on underlying cellular processes have produced contradictory claims, e.g. on SARS-CoV-2 cell entry or innate immune responses. However, clarity in these matters is imperative for therapy development. We therefore performed a meta-study with a diverse set of transcriptomes under infections with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including data from different cells and COVID-19 patients. Using these data, we investigated viral entry routes and innate immune responses. First, our analyses support the existence of cell entry mechanisms for SARS and SARS-CoV-2 other than the ACE2 route with evidence of inefficient infection of cells without expression of ACE2; expression of TMPRSS2/TPMRSS4 is unnecessary for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection with evidence of efficient infection of A549 cells transduced with a vector expressing human ACE2. Second, we find that innate immune responses in terms of interferons and interferon simulated genes are strong in relevant cells, for example Calu3 cells, but vary markedly with cell type, virus dose, and virus type.",Yingying Cao; Xintian Xu; Simo Kitanovski; Lina Song; Jun Wang; Pei Hao; Daniel Hoffmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425716,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425716,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
280,Neuropilin-1 Assists SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Stimulating the Separation of Spike Protein Domains S1 and S2,"The cell surface receptor Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) was recently identified as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. As the Spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 is cleaved into the S1 and the S2 domain by furin protease, Nrp1 binds to the newly created C-terminal RRAR amino acid sequence of the S1 domain. In this study, we model the association of a Nrp1 (a2-b1-b2) protein with the Spike protein computationally and analyze the topological constraints in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for binding with Nrp1 and ACE2. Importantly, we study the exit mechanism of S2 from the S1 domain with the assistance of ACE2 as well as Nrp1 by molecular dynamics pulling simulations. In the presence of Nrp1, by binding the S1 more strongly to the host membrane, there is a high probability of S2 being pulled out, rather than S1 being stretched. Thus, Nrp1 binding could stimulate the exit of S2 from the S1 domain, which will likely increase virus infectivity as the liberated S2 domain mediates the fusion of virus and host membranes. Understanding of such a Nrp1-assisted viral infection opens the gate for the generation of protein-protein inhibitors, such as antibodies, which could attenuate the infection mechanism and protect certain cells in a future combination therapy.",Zhenlu Li; Matthias Buck,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425627,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425627,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
281,Stable Interaction Of The UK B.1.1.7 lineage SARS-CoV-2 S1 Spike N501Y Mutant With ACE2 Revealed By Molecular Dynamics Simulation,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused a massive health crisis across the world, and genetic variants such as the D614G gaining enhanced infectivity and competitive fitness have significantly aggravated the global concern. In this regard, the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.1.7 lineage, reported from the United Kingdom (UK) is of great significance, in that it contains several mutations that increases its infection and transmission rates as evidenced by the increased number of clinical reports. Specifically, the N501Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) domain has been shown to possess increased affinity for ACE2, although the basis for this not yet clear. Here, we dissect the mechanism underlying the increased affinity using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the available ACE2-S1-RBD complex structure (6M0J) and show a prolonged and stable interaction of the Y501 residue in the N501Y mutant S1-RBD with interfacial residues, Y41 and K353, in ACE2 as compared to the wild type S1-RBD. Additionally, we find that the N501Y mutant S1-RBD displays altered dynamics that likely aids in its enhanced interaction with ACE2. By elucidating a mechanistic basis for the increased affinity of the N501Y mutation in S1-RBD for ACE2, we believe that the results presented here will aid in developing therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 including designing drugs targeting the ACE2-S1-RBD interaction.",Wesam Ahmed; Angelin M Phillip; Kabir H Biswas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425307,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425307,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False

Reverse vaccinology approach may provide us with significant therapeutic leads in this direction and further determination of T-cell / B-cell response to antigen. In the present study, we conducted population coverage analysis referring to the diverse Indian population. By using tools from Immune epitope database (IEDB), HLA- distribution analysis was performed to find the most promiscuous T-cell epitope out of In silico determined epitope of Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. Selection of these epitopes have been conducted based on their binding affinity with the maximum number of HLA alleles belong to the highest population coverage rate values for the chosen geographical area in India. 404 cleavage sites within the 1288 amino acids sequence of spike glycoprotein were determined by NetChop proteasomal cleavage prediction suggesting that this protein has adequate sites in the protein sequence for cleaving into appropriate epitopes. For population coverage analysis, 221 selected epitopes are considered that shows the projected population coverage as 83.08% with 19.29 average hit (average number of epitope hits/HLA combinations recognized by the population) and 5.91 pc90 (minimum number of epitope hits/HLA combinations recognized by 90% of the population). 54 epitopes are found with the highest coverage among the Indian population and highly conserved within the given spike RBD domain sequence. Docking analysis of each epitope with their respective allele suggests that the epitope NSFTRGVYY represents highest binding affinity with docking score -7.6 kcal/mol with its allele HLA-C*07:01 among all the epitopes. Since the Covid-19 cases are still in progress and seem to remain like this until we find an effective vaccine, moreover in countries like India, vast diversity in the population may present a hindrance to particular vaccine efficiency.

284,Interleukin-6 Receptor Antagonists in Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19 - Preliminary report,"BackgroundThe efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is unclear.

MethodsWe evaluated tocilizumab and sarilumab in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult patients with Covid-19, within 24 hours of commencing organ support in an intensive care unit, were randomized to receive either tocilizumab (8mg/kg) or sarilumab (400mg) or standard care (control). The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with pre-defined triggers to declare superiority, efficacy, equivalence or futility.

ResultsTocilizumab and sarilumab both met the pre-defined triggers for efficacy. At the time of full analysis 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab and 402 to control. Median organ support-free days were 10 (interquartile range [IQR] -1, 16), 11 (IQR 0, 16) and 0 (IQR -1, 15) for tocilizumab, sarilumab and control, respectively. Relative to control, median adjusted odds ratios were 1.64 (95% credible intervals [CrI] 1.25, 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95%CrI 1.17, 2.91) for sarilumab, yielding >99.9% and 99.5% posterior probabilities of superiority compared with control. Hospital mortality was 28.0% (98/350) for tocilizumab, 22.2% (10/45) for sarilumab and 35.8% (142/397) for control. All secondary outcomes and analyses supported efficacy of these IL-6 receptor antagonists.

ConclusionsIn critically ill patients with Covid-19 receiving organ support in intensive care, treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonists, tocilizumab and sarilumab, improved outcome, including survival.

285,Sequencing of SARS CoV2 in local transmission cases through oxford nanopore MinION platform from Karachi Pakistan,"The first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS CoV2) was imported to Pakistan in February 2020 since then 10,258 deaths have been witnessed. The virus has been mutating and local transmission cases from different countries vary due to host dependent viral adaptation. Many distinct clusters of variant SARS CoV2 have been defined globally. In this study, the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 was studied and locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants.The real time PCR was performed on nasopharyngeal specimen to confirm SARSCoV2 with Orf 1ab and E gene as targets. The viral sequencing was performed through oxford nanopore technology MinION platform. Isolates from first and second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Karachi were compared. The overall positivity rate for PCR was 26.24% with highest number of positive cases in June. Approximately, 37.45% PCR positive subjects aged between 19-40 years. All the isolates belonged to GH clade and shared missense mutation D614G in spike protein linked to increased transmission rate worldwide. Another spike protein mutation A222V coexisted with D614G in the virus from second wave of COVID-19. Based on the present findings it is suggested that the locally transmitted virus from Karachi vary from those reported from other parts of Pakistan. Slight variability was also observed between viruses from first and second wave. Variability in any potential vaccine target may result in failed trials therefore information on any local viral variants is always useful for effective vaccine design and/or selection.

Authors summaryDespite precautionary measures the COVID-19 pandemic is causing deaths all over the world. The continuous mutations in viral genome is making it difficult to design vaccines. Variability in genome is host dependent and data sharing has revealed that variant for different geographical locations may harbor different mutations. Keeping this in mind the current study was focused on the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID -19 suspected cases with impact of age and gender. The locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants. The sequenced viral genome varied from the already submitted sequences from Pakistan thereby confirming that slightly different viruses were causing infections during different time periods in Karachi. All belonged to GH clade with D614G, P323L and Q57H mutations. The virus from second wave had A222V mutation making it more different.

The role of asymptomatic, undiagnosed individuals in driving infection has become evident. Their unaccountability results in ineffective prevention. We developed a pipeline using genomic data to accurately predict a populations transmission network complete with the inference of unsampled sources. The system utilises Bayesian phylogenetics to capture evolutionary and infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It identified the effectiveness of preventive measures in Canadas Atlantic bubble and mobile populations such as New York State. Its robustness extends to the prediction of cross-species disease transmission as we inferred SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to lions and tigers in New York Citys Bronx Zoo.

287,Stochastic model for COVID-19 in slums: interaction between biology and public policies,"We present a mathematical model for the simulation of the development of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a slum area under different interventions. Instead of representing interventions as modulations of the parameters of a free running epidemic we introduce a model structure that accounts for the actions but does not assume the results. The disease is modelled in terms of the progression of viremia reported in scientific works. The emergence of symptoms in the model reflects the statistics of a nation-wide highly detailed database consisting of more than 62000 cases (about a half of the confirmed by RT-PCR tests) with recorded symptoms in Argentina. The stochastic model displays several of the characteristics of COVID-19 such as a high variability in the evolution of the outbreaks, including long periods in which they run undetected, spontaneous extinction followed by a late outbreak and unimodal as well as bimodal progressions of daily counts of cases (second waves without ad-hoc hypothesis). We show how the relation between undetected cases (including the ""asymptomatic"" cases) and detected cases changes as a function of the public policies, the efficiency of the implementation and the timing with respect to the development of the outbreak. We show also that the relation between detected cases and total cases strongly depends on the implemented policies and that detected cases cannot be regarded as a measure of the outbreak, being the dependency between total cases and detected cases in general not monotonic as a function of the efficiency in the intervention method. According to the model, it is possible to control an outbreak with interventions based on the detection of symptoms only in the case when the presence of just one symptom prompts isolation and the detection efficiency reaches about 80% of the cases. Requesting two symptoms to trigger intervention can be enough to fail in the goals.",Hernan G. Solari; Mario A.

We estimate age-specific IFR using data from seroprevalence surveys in Mumbai (population 12 million) and Karnataka (population 61 million), and a random sample of economically distressed migrants in Bihar with mortality followup. Among men aged 50-89, IFR is 0.12% in Karnataka (95% C.I. 0.09%-0.15%), 0.53% in Mumbai (0.52%-0.54%), and 5.64% among migrants in Bihar (0-11.16%).

289,Prevalence of RT-PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection at schools: First results from the Austrian School-SARS-CoV-2 Study,"BackgroundThee is much debate about the role of schools and children in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We aimed to quantify reliably the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections at schools detected with reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR).

MethodsThis nationwide prospective cohort study monitors a representative sample of pupils (grade 1-8) and teachers at Austrian schools throughout the school year 2020/2021. We repeatedly test participants for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a gargling solution and RT-PCR. We herein report on the first two rounds of examinations. We used mixed-effect logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and robust 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

FindingsWe analysed data on 10734 participants from 245 schools (9465 pupils, 1269 teachers). Prevalence of RT-PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection increased from 0.39% at round 1 (95% CI 0.28-0.55%, 29 September-22 October 2020) to 1.42% at round 2 (95% CI 1.06-1.90%, 10-16 November). Odds ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 2.29 (95% CI 1.26-4.17, P=0.007) in regions with >500 vs. [&le;]500 inhabitants/km2, 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.00, P<0.001) for a two-fold higher regional 7-day incidence, and 2.71 (95% CI 1.68-4.39, P<0.001) in pupils at schools with a high/very high vs. low/moderate social deprivation index. Associations of community incidence and social deprivation persisted in multivariable models. There were no differences between age groups, sexes, pupils vs. teachers, or primary (grade 1-4) vs. secondary schools (grade 5-8).

InterpretationThis monitoring study in Austrian schools revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 0.39%-1.42% of participants and identified associations of regional community incidence and social deprivation with higher prevalence.

290,"Viral Variants and Vaccinations: If We Can Change the COVID-19 Vaccine, Should We?","As we close in on one year since the COVID-19 pandemic began, hope has been placed on bringing the virus under control through mass administration of recently developed vaccines. Unfortunately, newly emerged, fast-spreading strains of COVID-19 threaten to undermine progress by interfering with vaccine efficacy. While a long-term solution to this challenge would be to develop vaccines that simultaneously target multiple different COVID-19 variants, this approach faces both developmental and regulatory hurdles. A simpler option would be to switch the target of the current vaccine to better match the newest viral variant. I use a stochastic simulation to determine when it is better to target a newly emerged viral variant and when it is better to target the dominant but potentially less transmissible strain. My simulation results suggest that it is almost always better to target the faster spreading strain, even when the initial prevalence of this variant is much lower. In scenarios where targeting the slower spreading variant is best, all vaccination strategies perform relatively well, meaning that the choice of vaccination strategy has a small effect on public health outcomes. In scenarios where targeting the faster spreading variant is best, use of vaccines against the faster spreading viral variant can save many lives. My results provide  rule of thumb guidance for those making critical decisions about vaccine formulation over the coming months.",Sharon Bewick,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249255,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249255,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
291,Associations between Stress and Child Verbal Abuse and Corporal Punishment during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Potential Effect Modification by Lockdown Measures,"BackgroundChild abuse appears to be on the increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the extent that lockdown measures modified the association between stress and abuses has not been systematically assessed.

ObjectivesTo assess: 1) the association between caregivers stress and self-reported verbal abuse and corporal punishment of a child in the household, and; 2) modification of the stated association by experienced COVID-19 lockdown measures.

Participants and settingsCaregivers residing in villages on lockdown in the Deep South of Thailand (n=466 participants)

MethodsWe randomly sampled 12 villages in the study area, and 40 households per village. Trained enumerators who were residents of the sampled villages collected the data using phone-based interview. We measured stress level using the standard ST-5 questionnaire. We developed and pilot-tested questions for measurement of child abuse and lockdown experiences specifically for this study.

ResultsCaregivers with moderate and higher levels of stress were more likely than caregivers with low level of stress to report verbal abuse (48% vs. 23%, respectively; Adj. OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.89, 5.15) and corporal punishment (28% vs. 8%, respectively; Adj. OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.41, 5.42). We found that COVID-19 lockdown experiences modified the associations between stress and verbal abuse and corporal punishment.

ConclusionThere were associations between stress and abuses, which were modified by lockdown experiences. However, social desirability, lack of details in the answers, and potential confounding by mental illness co-morbidities were notable limitations of the study.

292,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the urban population of Qatar: An analysis of antibody testing on a sample of 112,941 individuals","BackgroundQatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our first objective was to assess the proportion of the urban population that has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, by measuring the prevalence of detectable antibodies. Our second objective was to identify predictors for infection and for having higher antibody titers.

MethodsResidual blood specimens from individuals receiving routine and other clinical care between May 12-September 9, 2020 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Associations with seropositivity and higher antibody titers were identified through regression analyses. Probability weights were applied in deriving the epidemiological measures.

ResultsWe tested 112,941 individuals ([~]10% of Qatars urban population), of whom 51.6% were men and 66.0% were 20-49 years of age. Seropositivity was 13.3% (95% CI: 13.1-13.6%) and was significantly associated with sex, age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. The proportion with higher antibody titers varied by age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date. There was a strong correlation between higher antibody titers and seroprevalence in each nationality, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96), suggesting that higher antibody titers may indicate repeated exposure to the virus. The percentage of antibody-positive persons with prior PCR-confirmed diagnosis was 47.1% (95% CI: 46.1-48.2%), severity rate was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7-4.2%), criticality rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4%), and fatality rate was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.3%).

ConclusionsFewer than two in every 10 individuals in Qatars urban population had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 between May 12-September 9, 2020, suggesting that this population is still far from the herd immunity threshold and at risk from a subsequent epidemic wave.",Peter V.

293,Machine Learning Forecast of Growth in COVID-19 Confirmed Infection Cases with Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and Cultural Dimensions: Algorithm Development and Validation,"BackgroundNational governments have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions to control and mitigate against the COVID-19 pandemic. A deep understanding of these interventions is required.

ObjectiveWe investigate the prediction of future daily national Confirmed Infection Growths - the percentage change in total cumulative cases across 14 days - using metrics representative of non-pharmaceutical interventions and cultural dimensions of each country.

MethodsWe combine the OxCGRT dataset, Hofstedes cultural dimensions, and COVID-19 daily reported infection case numbers to train and evaluate five non-time series machine learning models in predicting Confirmed Infection Growth. We use three validation methods - in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation - for evaluation, each applicable to a different use case of the models.

ResultsOur results demonstrate high R2 values between the labels and predictions for the in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation methods (0.959, 0.513, and 0.574 respectively) using random forest and AdaBoost regression. While these models may be used to predict the Confirmed Infection Growth, the differing accuracies obtained from the three tasks suggest a strong influence of the use case.

294,Genomic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Zimbabwe: Role of international travel and regional migration in spread,"Zimbabwe reported its first case of SARS-Cov-2 infection in March 2020, and case numbers increased to more than 8,099 to 16th October 2020. An understanding of the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak in Zimbabwe will assist in the implementation of effective public health interventions to control transmission. Nasopharyngeal samples from 92,299 suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Zimbabwe between 20 March and 16 October 2020 were obtained. Available demographic data associated with those cases identified as positive (8,099) were analysed to describe the national breakdown of positive cases over time in more detail (geographical location, sex, age and travel history). The whole genome sequence (WGS) of one hundred SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from the first 120 days of the epidemic in Zimbabwe was determined to identify their relationship to one another and WGS from global samples. Overall, a greater proportion of infections were in males (55.5%) than females (44.85%), although in older age groups more females were affected than males. Most COVID-19 cases (57 %) were in the 20-40 age group. Eight lineages, from at least 25 separate introductions into the region were found using comparative genomics. Of these, 95% had the D614G mutation on the spike protein which was associated with higher transmissibility than the ancestral strain. Early introductions and spread of SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly associated with genomes common in Europe and the United States of America (USA), and few common in Asia at this time. As the pandemic evolved, travel-associated cases from South Africa and other neighbouring countries were also recorded. Transmission within quarantine centres occurred when travelling nationals returning to Zimbabwe. International and regional migration followed by local transmission were identified as accounting for the development of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Zimbabwe. Based on this, rapid implementation of public health interventions are critical to reduce local transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

295,Twitter Discourse on Nicotine as Potential Prophylactic or Therapeutic for COVID-19,"ObjectiveThe low observed prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in certain cohorts has led to a hypothesis regarding nicotines therapeutic role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As new scientific evidence surfaces, premature conclusions about nicotine are rife in social media, especially unwarranted leaps of such associations to vaping and smoking. This study reports on the prevalence of such leaps and the nature of authors who are making them.

MethodsWe used a Twitter API subscription service to download tweets (n = 17,533) that match terms indicating nicotine or vaping themes, in addition to those that point to a prophylactic or therapeutic effect and COVID-19 (January-July 2020). Using a windowing approach, we focused on tweets that are more likely to convey the therapeutic intent. We hand-annotated these filtered tweets and built a classifier that identifies tweets that extrapolate a nicotine link to vaping/smoking. We analyzed the frequently used terms in author bios, top Web links, and hashtags of such tweets.

Results21% of our filtered tweets indicate a vaping/smoking-based prevention/treatment narrative. Our classifier was able to spot tweets that make unproven claims about vaping/smoking and COVID-19 with a positive predictive value of 85%. Qualitative analyses show a variety of ways therapeutic claims are being made and user bios reveal pre-existing notions of positive stances toward vaping.

ConclusionThe social media landscape is a double-edged sword in tobacco communication. Although it increases information reach, consumers can also be subject to confirmation bias when exposed to inadvertent or deliberate framing of scientific discourse that may border on misinformation. This calls for circumspection and additional planning in countering such narratives as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage our world.",Ramakanth Kavuluru; Jiho Noh; Shyanika W Rose,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249284,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249284,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
296,Prevalence and Factors associated with Mental health impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: A survey-based cross-sectional study,"BackgroundFeelings of isolation, insecurity, and instability triggered by COVID-19 could have a long-term impact on the mental health status of individuals. This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with the mental health symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.

MethodsFrom 1st - 30th April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors.

ResultsThe prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms while, the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self-quarantine in the previous 7 days before the survey and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat.

ConclusionOur results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% experienced depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and levels of stress, respectively.

297,Saliva viral load is a dynamic unifying correlate of COVID-19 severity and mortality,"While several clinical and immunological parameters correlate with disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, work remains in identifying unifying correlates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used to guide clinical practice. Here, we examine saliva and nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load over time and correlate them with patient demographics, and cellular and immune profiling. We found that saliva viral load was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 risk factors; that it correlated with increasing levels of disease severity and showed a superior ability over nasopharyngeal viral load as a predictor of mortality over time (AUC=0.90). A comprehensive analysis of immune factors and cell subsets revealed strong predictors of high and low saliva viral load, which were associated with increased disease severity or better overall outcomes, respectively. Saliva viral load was positively associated with many known COVID-19 inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, and CXCL10, as well as type 1 immune response cytokines. Higher saliva viral loads strongly correlated with the progressive depletion of platelets, lymphocytes, and effector T cell subsets including circulating follicular CD4 T cells (cTfh). Anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels were negatively correlated with saliva viral load showing a strong temporal association that could help distinguish severity and mortality in COVID-19. Finally, patients with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher viral loads, which correlated with the depletion of cTfh cells, and lower production of anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels. Together these results demonstrated that viral load - as measured by saliva but not nasopharyngeal -- is a dynamic unifying correlate of disease presentation, severity, and mortality over time.",Julio Silva; Carolina Lucas; Maria Sundaram; Benjamin Israelow; Patrick Wong; Jon Klein; Maria Tokuyama; Peiwen Lu; Arvind Venkataraman; Feimei Liu; Tianyang Mao; Ji Eun Oh; Annsea Park; arnau Casanovas-Massana; Chantal B.F.

298,Long term impact on lung function of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. A prospective cohort study,"IntroductionA significant number of patients continue to recover from COVID-19; however, little is known about the lung function capacity among survivors. We aim to determine the long-term impact on lung function capacity in patients who have survived moderate or severe COVID-19 disease in a resource-poor setting.

Methods and analysisThis prospective cohort study will include patients aged 15 years and above and have reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for COVID 19 (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal). Patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of obstructive or interstitial lung disease, lung fibrosis and cancers, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune conditions affecting the lungs, underlying heart disease, history of syncope and refuse to participate will be excluded. Pulmonary function will be assessed using spirometry and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) at three- and six-months interval. A chest X-ray at three and six-month follow-up and CT-chest will be performed if clinically indicated after consultation with the study pulmonologist or Infectious Disease (ID) physician. Echocardiogram (ECHO) to look for pulmonary hypertension at the three months visit and repeated at six months if any abnormality is identified initially. Data analysis will be performed using standard statistical software.

Ethics and disseminationThe proposal was reviewed and approved by ethics review committee (ERC) of the institution (ERC reference number 2020-4735-11311). Informed consent will be obtained from each study participant. The results will be disseminated among study participants, institutional, provincial and national level through seminars and presentations. Moreover, the scientific findings will be published in high-impact peer-reviewed medical journals.

Strengths and Limitations of this study- The study has the potential to develop context-specific evidence on the long-term impact on lung function among COVID-19 survivors
- Findings will play key role in understanding the impact of the disease on vital functions and help devise rehabilitative strategies to best overcome the effects of disease

299,THE INTESTINAL AND ORAL MICROBIOMES ARE ROBUST PREDICTORS OF COVID-19 SEVERITY THE MAIN PREDICTOR OF COVID-19-RELATED FATALITY,"The reason for the striking differences in clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is still poorly understood. While most recover, a subset of people become critically ill and succumb to the disease. Thus, identification of biomarkers that can predict the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 disease is key to help prioritize patients needing urgent treatment. Given that an unbalanced gut microbiome is a reflection of poor health, we aim to identify indicator species that could predict COVID-19 disease clinical outcomes. Here, for the first time and with the largest COVID-19 patient cohort reported for microbiome studies, we demonstrated that the intestinal and oral microbiome make-up predicts respectively with 92% and 84% accuracy (Area Under the Curve or AUC) severe COVID-19 respiratory symptoms that lead to death. The accuracy of the microbiome prediction of COVID-19 severity was found to be far superior to that from training similar models using information from comorbidities often adopted to triage patients in the clinic (77% AUC). Additionally, by combining symptoms, comorbidities, and the intestinal microbiota the model reached the highest AUC at 96%. Remarkably the model training on the stool microbiome found enrichment of Enterococcus faecalis, a known pathobiont, as the top predictor of COVID-19 disease severity. Enterococcus faecalis is already easily cultivable in clinical laboratories, as such we urge the medical community to include this bacterium as a robust predictor of COVID-19 severity when assessing risk stratification of patients in the clinic.",Doyle V Ward; Shakti Bhattarai; Mayra Rojas-Correa; Ayan Purkayastha; Devon Holler; Ming Da Qu; William G Mitchell; Jason Yang; Samuel Fountain; Abigail Zeamer; Catherine Forconi; Gavin Fujimori; Boaz Odwar; Caitlin Cawley; Beth A McCormick; Ann Moormann; Mireya Wessolossky; Vanni Bucci; Ana Maldonado-Contreras,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20249061,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20249061,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True

However, factors that drive the development of high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and how long those antibodies persist remain unclear. Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and demographic factors that correlate with high titers. Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels did not decline three months after symptom resolution (n=79). As expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. We demonstrated for the first time that COVID-19 symptoms, namely fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and low appetite, correlated consistently with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.

301,Impaired performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid tests at elevated temperatures,"Rapid antigen-detecting tests (Ag-RDTs) can complement molecular diagnostics for COVID-19. The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 5-30{degrees}C. In many countries that would benefit from SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, mean temperatures exceed 30{degrees}C. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including (i) long-term storage and testing at recommended conditions, (ii) recommended storage conditions followed by 10 minutes exposure to 37{degrees}C and testing at 37{degrees}C and (iii) 3 weeks storage followed by testing at 37{degrees}C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 8.2x105-7.9x107 genome copies/ml of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 minutes pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37{degrees}C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for 46% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37{degrees}C, 73% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture-derived human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 was not affected by storage and testing at 37{degrees}C. In summary, short- and long-term exposure to elevated temperatures likely impairs sensitivity of several SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs that may translate to false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with inter-individual transmission.

302,Ivermectin shows clinical benefits in mild to moderate Covid19 disease: A randomised controlled double blind dose response study in Lagos.,"IntroductionIn vitro studies have shown the efficacy of Ivermectin (IV) to inhibit the SARS - CoV-2 viral replication, but questions remained as to In-vivo applications. We set out to explore the efficacy and safety of Ivermectin in persons infected with COVID19.

MethodsWe conducted a translational proof of concept (PoC) randomized, double blind placebo controlled, dose response, parallel group study of IV efficacy in RT - PCR proven COVID 19 positive patients. 62 patients were randomized to 3 treatment groups. (A) IV 6mg regime, (B)IV 12 mg regime (given Q84hrs for 2weeks) (C, control) Lopinavir/Ritonavir. All groups plus standard of Care.

ResultsThe Days to COVID negativity [DTN] was significantly and dose dependently reduced by IV (p = 0.0066). The DTN for Control were, = 9.1+/-5.2, for A 6.0 +/- 2.9, and for B 4.6 +/-3.2. 2 Way repeated measures ANOVA of ranked COVID 19 + / - scores at 0, 84, 168, 232 hours showed a significant IV treatment effect (p=0.035) and time effect (p <0.0001). IV also tended to increase SPO2 % compared to controls, p = 0.073, 95% CI - 0.39 to 2.59 and increased platelet count compared to C (p = 0.037) 95%CI 5.55 - 162.55 x 103/ml. The platelet count increase was inversely correlated to DTN (r = -0.52, p = 0.005). No SAE was reported.

Conclusions12 mg IV regime may have superior efficacy. IV should be considered for use in clinical management of SARS-Cov-2, and may find applications in community prophylaxis in high-risk areas.",Olufemi Emmanuel Babalola; Christopher Olusanjo Bode; Adesuyi Adeyinka Ajayi; Felix M Alakaloko; Iorhen Ephraim Akase; Erere Otrofanowei; Olumuyiwa Babalola Salu; Wasiu Lanre Adeyemo; Adesoji O Ademuyiwa; Sunday A Omilabu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249131,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249131,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
303,Modelling Decay of Population Immunity With Proposed Second Dose Deferral Strategy,"A second dose deferred strategy has been proposed to increase initial population immunity as an alternative to the default two dose vaccine regimen with spacing of 21 or 28 days between vaccine doses for the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. This increased initial population immunity is only of value if one dose immunity does not decay so fast as to nullify the benefit. Because decay rates of one dose and two dose efficacy are currently unknown, a model to project population immunity between the two strategies was created. By evaluating the decay rate of one dose efficacy, two dose efficacy, and time until the second dose is given, the model shows that if there is an increased decay rate of one dose efficacy relative to the two dose decay rate, it is highly unlikely to nullify the benefit of increased population immunity seen in a second dose deferral strategy. Rather, all reasonable scenarios strongly favour a second dose deferral strategy with much higher projected population immunity in comparison to the default regimen.",Graham T Jurgens,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249293,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249293,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
304,Adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in recovered severe COVID-19 patients,"ObjectivesThere is an imperative need to determine the durability of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. We enumerated SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeting S1 and M proteins and measured RBD-specific serum IgG over a period of 2-6 months after symptoms onset in a cohort of subjects who had recovered from severe clinical forms of COVID-19.

MethodsWe recruited 58 patients (38 males and 20 females; median age, 62.5 years), who had been hospitalized with bilateral pneumonia, 60% with one or more comorbidities. IgG antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were measured by ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD69+-expressing-IFN{gamma}-producing-CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were enumerated in heparinized whole blood by flow cytometry for ICS.

ResultsDetectable SARS-CoV-2-S1/M-reactive CD69+-IFN-{gamma} CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were displayed in 17 (29.3%) and 6 (10.3%) subjects respectively, at a median of 84 days after onset of symptoms (range, 58-191 days). Concurrent comorbidities increased the risk (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.03-9.61; P=0.04) of undetectable T-cell responses in models adjusted for age, sex and hospitalization ward. Twenty-one out of the 35 patients (60%) had detectable RBD-specific serum IgGs at a median of 118 days (range, 60 to 145 days) after symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG serum levels were found to drop significantly over time.

ConclusionA relatively limited number of subjects who developed severe forms of COVID-19 had detectable SARS-CoV-2-S1/M IFN{gamma} CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at midterm after clinical diagnosis. Our data also indicated that serum levels of RBD-specific IgGs decline over time, becoming undetectable in some patients.",Beatriz Olea; Eliseo Albert Vicent Sr.; Ignacio Torres Sr.; Paula Amat; Maria Jose Remigia; Roberto Gozalbo Sr.; Jesus Rodriguez Sr.; Javier Buesa Sr.; Maria Luisa Blasco Sr.; Josep Redon Sr.; Jaime Signes Sr.; David Navarro Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20249027,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.20249027,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
305,"Human cell-dependent, directional, time-dependent changes in the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes","BackgroundWhen a virus that has grown in a nonhuman host starts an epidemic in the human population, human cells may not provide growth conditions ideal for the virus. Therefore, the invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is usually prevalent in the bat population, into the human population is thought to have necessitated changes in the viral genome for efficient growth in the new environment. In the present study, to understand host-dependent changes in coronavirus genomes, we focused on the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and investigated how these compositions changed time-dependently in the human cellular environment. We also compared the oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats to investigate the causes of changes in the host environment.

ResultsTime-series analyses of changes in the nucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a group of mono- and oligonucleotides whose compositions changed in a common direction for all clades, even though viruses belonging to different clades should evolve independently. Interestingly, the compositions of these oligonucleotides changed towards those of coronaviruses that have been prevalent in humans for a long period and away from those of bat coronaviruses.

ConclusionsClade-independent, time-dependent changes are thought to have biological significance and should relate to viral adaptation to a new host environment, providing important clues for understanding viral host adaptation mechanisms.",Yuki Iwasaki; Takashi Abe; Toshimichi Ikemura,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425508,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425508,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False
306,COVID-19 virtual patient cohort reveals immune mechanisms driving disease outcomes,"To understand the diversity of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and distinguish features that predispose individuals to severe COVID-19, we developed a mechanistic, within-host mathematical model and virtual patient cohort. Our results indicate that virtual patients with low production rates of infected cell derived IFN subsequently experienced highly inflammatory disease phenotypes, compared to those with early and robust IFN responses. In these in silico patients, the maximum concentration of IL-6 was also a major predictor of CD8+ T cell depletion. Our analyses predicted that individuals with severe COVID-19 also have accelerated monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation that was mediated by increased IL-6 and reduced type I IFN signalling. Together, these findings identify biomarkers driving the development of severe COVID-19 and support early interventions aimed at reducing inflammation.

Author summaryUnderstanding of how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infections is critical for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches. Identifying which immune mechanisms lead to divergent outcomes can be clinically difficult, and experimental models and longitudinal data are only beginning to emerge. In response, we developed a mechanistic, mathematical and computational model of the immunopathology of COVID-19 calibrated to and validated against a broad set of experimental and clinical immunological data. To study the drivers of severe COVID-19, we used our model to expand a cohort of virtual patients, each with realistic disease dynamics. Our results identify key processes that regulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in virtual patients and suggest viable therapeutic targets, underlining the importance of a rational approach to studying novel pathogens using intra-host models.",Adrianne L.

307,RNA-protein interaction analysis of SARS-CoV-2 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions identifies an antiviral role of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-strand RNA virus. Viral genome is capped at the 5-end, followed by an untranslated region (UTR). There is poly-A tail at 3-end, preceded by an UTR. Self-interaction between the RNA regulatory elements present within 5- and 3-UTRs as well as their interaction with host/virus-encoded proteins mediate the function of 5- and 3-UTRs. Using RNA-protein interaction detection (RaPID) assay coupled to liquid chromatography with tandem mass-spectrometry, we identified host interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 5- and 3-UTRs and generated an RNA-protein interaction network. By combining these data with the previously known protein-protein interaction data proposed to be involved in virus replication, we generated the RNA-protein-protein interaction (RPPI) network, likely to be essential for controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication. Notably, bioinformatics analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism. Lysosome-associated membrane protein-2a (Lamp2a) was one of the host proteins that interact with the 5-UTR. Further studies showed that Lamp2 level is upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and overexpression of Lamp2a and Lamp2b variants reduced viral RNA level in infected cells and vice versa. In summary, our study provides an useful resource of SARS-CoV-2 5- and 3-UTR binding proteins and reveal the antiviral function of host Lamp2 protein.

ImportanceReplication of a positive-strand RNA virus involves an RNA-protein complex consisting of viral genomic RNA, host RNA(s), virus-encoded proteins and host proteins. Dissecting out individual components of the replication complex will help decode the mechanism of viral replication. 5- and 3-UTRs in positive-strand RNA viruses play essential regulatory roles in virus replication. Here, we identified the host proteins that associate with the UTRs of SARS-CoV-2, combined those data with the previously known protein-protein interaction data (expected to be involved in virus replication) and generated the RNA-protein-protein interaction (RPPI) network. Analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism, which are important for virus replication. Analysis of one of the interaction partners of the 5-UTR (Lamp2a) demonstrated its antiviral role in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Collectively, our study provides a resource of SARS-CoV-2 UTR-binding proteins and identifies an antiviral role of host Lamp2a protein.",Rohit Verma; Sandhini Saha; Shiv Kumar; Shailendra Mani; Tushar Kanti Maiti; Milan Surjit,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425516,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425516,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False
308,Protein scaffold-based multimerization of soluble ACE2 efficiently blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) decoy receptors are promising agents to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 as they are not affected by common escape mutations in viral proteins. However, their success may be limited by their relatively poor potency. To address these challenges, we developed a highly active multimeric sACE2 decoy receptor via a SunTag system that could neutralize both pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates. This fusion protein demonstrated a neutralization efficiency nearly 250-fold greater than monomeric sACE2. SunTag in combination with a more potent version of sACE2 achieved near complete neutralization at a sub-nanomolar range, which is comparable with clinical monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate that this activity is due to greater occupancy of the multimeric decoy receptors on Spike protein as compared to monomeric sACE2. Overall, these highly potent multimeric sACE2 decoy receptors offer a promising treatment approach against SARS-CoV-2 infections including its novel variants.",Alisan Kayabolen; Ugur Akcan; Dogancan Ozturan; Ehsan Sarayloo; Elif Nurtop; Berna Ozer; Gizem Nur Sahin; Ozlem Dogan; Nathan Lack; Mehmet Kaya; Cem Albayrak; Fusun Can; Ihsan Solaroglu; Tugba Bagci-Onder,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425128,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425128,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False
309,Chitinase 3-like-1 is a Therapeutic Target That Mediates the Effects of Aging in COVID-19,"COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) virus and is more prevalent and severe in the elderly and patients with comorbid diseases (CM). Because chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) is induced during aging and CM, the relationships between CHI3L1 and SC2 were investigated. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of the SC2 receptor ACE2 and viral spike protein priming proteases (SPP), that ACE2 and SPP are induced during aging and that anti-CHI3L1, kasugamycin and inhibitors of phosphorylation, abrogate these ACE2- and SPP-inductive events. Human studies also demonstrated that the levels of circulating CHI3L1 are increased in the elderly and patients with CM where they correlate with COVID-19 severity. These studies demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of ACE2 and SPP; that this induction is a major mechanism contributing to the effects of aging during SC2 infection and that CHI3L1 coopts the CHI3L1 axis to augment SC2 infection. CHI3L1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of and is an attractive therapeutic target in COVID-19.",Suchitra Kamle; Bing Ma; Chuan Hua He; Bedia Akosman; Yang Zhou; Chang-Min Lee; Wafik S.

310,"SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro evolution follows contagious mutation spread, yet generates an able infection inhibitor","SARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving, with more contagious mutations spreading rapidly. Using in vitro evolution to affinity maturate the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein towards ACE2, resulted in the more contagious mutations, S477N, E484K, and N501Y to be among the first selected. This includes the British and South-African variants. Plotting the binding affinity to ACE2 of all RBD mutations against their incidence in the population shows a strong correlation between the two. Further in vitro evolution enhancing binding by 600-fold provides guidelines towards potentially new evolving mutations with even higher infectivity. For example, Q498R in combination with N501Y. This said, the high-affinity RBD is also an efficient drug, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection.

311,Role of spatial patterning of N-protein interactions in SARS-CoV-2 genome packaging,"Viruses must efficiently and specifically package their genomes while excluding cellular nucleic acids and viral sub-genomic fragments. Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5 and 3 ends of the genome, whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or solubilization. With respect to genome compaction and cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5 and 3 ends of the genome, consistent with the native spatial patterning. Single genome packaging is possible for diverse arrangements of LLPS-promoting sequences in the genome, but only in limited conditions at the edge of the phase boundary. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich specific, long RNA sequences in a defined order.

Statement of significanceThe COVID-19 pandemic has motivated research of the basic mechanisms of coronavirus replication. A major challenge faced by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 is the selective packaging of a large genome in a relatively small capsid while excluding host and subgenomic nucleic acids. Genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can condense with the Nucleocapsid (N)-protein, a protein component critical for packaging of many viruses. Notably, certain regions of the genomic RNA drive condensation of N-protein while other regions solubilize it. Here, we explore how the spatial patterning of these opposing elements promotes single genome compaction, packaging, and cyclization. This model informs future in silico experiments addressing spatial patterning of genomic features that are experimentally intractable because of the extensive size of the genome.",Ian Seim; Christine Roden; Amy Gladfelter,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425605,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425605,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False

313,SARS-CoV-2 spike downregulates tetherin to enhance viral spread,"The antiviral restriction factor, tetherin, blocks the release of several different families of enveloped viruses, including the Coronaviridae. Tetherin is an interferon-induced protein that forms parallel homodimers between the host cell and viral particles, linking viruses to the surface of infected cells and inhibiting their release. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 downregulates tetherin to aid its release from cells, and investigate potential proteins involved in this process. Loss of tetherin from cells caused an increase in SARS-CoV-2 viral titre. We find SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to be responsible for tetherin downregulation, rather than ORF7a as previously described for the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV. We instead find ORF7a to be responsible for Golgi fragmentation, and expression of ORF7a in cells recapitulates Golgi fragmentation observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.

314,Self-organized stem cell-derived human lung buds with proximo-distal patterning and novel targets of SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of therapeutics hinders pandemic control1-2. Although lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients1-3, how SARS-CoV-2 induces tissue pathology in the lung remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate tens of thousands of self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically matched human lung buds derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) cultured on micropatterned substrates. Strikingly, in vitro-derived human lung buds resemble fetal human lung tissue and display in vivo-like proximo-distal coordination of alveolar and airway tissue differentiation whose 3D epithelial self-organization is directed by the levels of KGF. Single-cell transcriptomics unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNThi cycling alveolar stem cells, a human-specific lung cell type4. These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission. Our platform offers unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant lung tissue that recapitulate key hallmarks of human lung development and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify candidate therapeutics for COVID-19.",Edwin A Rosado-Olivieri; Brandon Razooky; Hans-Heinrich Hoffmann; Riccardo De Santis; Charles M Rice; Ali H Brivanlou,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425622,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425622,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,False
315,Distinct mutations and lineages of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the early phase of COVID-19 global pandemic and subsequent global expansion,"A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused over 85 million cases and over 1.8 million deaths worldwide since it occurred twelve months ago in Wuhan, China. Here we conceptualized the time-series evolutionary and expansion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 by taking a series of cross-sectional view of viral genomes from early outbreak in January in Wuhan to early phase of global ignition in early April, and finally to the subsequent global expansion by late December 2020. By scrutinizing cases from early outbreak, we found a viral genotype from the Seafood Market in Wuhan featured with two concurrent mutations has become the overwhelmingly dominant genotype (95.7%) of the pandemic. By analyzing 4,013 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different continents by early April, we were able to visualize the genomic diversity over a 14-week timespan since the outbreak in Wuhan. 2,954 unique nucleotide substitutions were identified with 31 of the 4,013 genomes remaining as ancestral type, and 952 (32.2%) mutations recurred in more than one genome. 11 major viral genotypes with unique geographic distributions were identified. As the pandemic has been unfolding for more than one year, we also used the same approach to analyze 261,323 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the world since the outbreak in Wuhan (i.e. including all the available viral genomes in the GISAID database as of 25 December 2020) in order to recapitulate our findings in a real-time fashion and to present a full catalogue of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We demonstrated the viral genotypic dynamics from different geographic locations over one-year timespan reveal transmission routes and indicate subsequent expansion. This study, to our knowledge, is heretofore the largest and most comprehensive genomic study of SARS-CoV-2. It indicates the viral genotypes can be utilized as molecular barcodes in combination with epidemiologic data to monitor the spreading routes of the pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. Moreover, the dynamics of viral mutational spectrum in the study may help the early identification of new strains in patients to reduce further spread of infection, and guide the development of molecular diagnosis and vaccines against COVID-19, and last but not the least help assess their accuracy and efficacy.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, in order to mitigate the risk of further regional expansions as well as to estimate the effectiveness of control measures in various regions, viral genomic studies on its origins, transmission routes and expansion models have begun to surge. Several studies on the genomics of SARS-CoV-2 virus have offered clues of the origins, and transmission path of the disease. However, due to lack of early samples, a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and/or focusing on specific geographic locations, we still lack a complete global view of the expansion of COVID-19 in the context of the viral mutational spectrum.

Added value of this studyIn this study we provide a global view of the mutation dynamic and transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 with a foothold on the early phase of the pandemic. This is also the largest and the most comprehensive SARS-CoV-2019 viral genome study and molecular epidemiology study that provides an unprecedented time window to study mutations and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The unique molecular barcodes defined by Strain of Origin (SOO) algorithm can be utilized to prospectively monitor the spreading trajectory and reveal the expansion of the ongoing pandemic. Our full catalogue of SARS-CoV-2 mutations can also guide the development and help assess the accuracy of molecular diagnosis and the efficacy of the vaccines against COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe results that we presented here serve as a proof of concept to demonstrate the utility of large-scale viral genome sequencing during a novel pathogen outbreak.

316,The spread of breathing air from wind instruments and singers using schlieren techniques,"In this article, the spread of breathing air when playing wind instruments and singing was investigated and visualized using two methods: (1) schlieren imaging with a schlieren mirror and (2) background-oriented schlieren (BOS). These methods visualize airflow by visualizing density gradients in transparent media. The playing of professional woodwind and brass instrument players, as well as professional classical trained singers, were investigated to estimate the spread distances of the breathing air. For a better comparison and consistent measurement series, a single high and a single low note as well as an extract of a musical piece were investigated. Additionally, anemometry was used to determine the velocity of the spreading breathing air and the extent to which it was still quantifiable. The results presented in this article show there is no airflow escaping from the instruments, which is transported farther than 1.2 m into the room. However, differences in the various instruments have to be considered to assess properly the spread of the breathing air.

The characterization of the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is vital for serosurveillance purposes as well for treatment options such as transfusion with convalescent plasma or immunoglobin products derived from convalescent plasma. In this study, we measured antibody responses in 844 longitudinal samples from 151 RT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 convalescent adults during the first 34 weeks after onset of symptoms. All donors were seropositive at the first sampling moment and only one donor seroreverted during follow-up analysis. Anti-RBD IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels slowly declined with median half-lifes of 62 and 59 days during 2-5 months after symptom onset, respectively. The rate of decline of antibody levels diminished during extended follow-up. In addition, the magnitude of the IgG response correlated with neutralization capacity measured in a classic plaque reduction assay as well in our in-house developed competition assay.

318,No association between the SARS-CoV-2 variants and mortality rates in the Eastern Mediterranean Region,"As the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in all countries, there is a growing interest in monitoring and understanding the impact of emerging strains on virus transmission and disease severity. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences collected in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries which, as of 12 November 2020. The majority (73.7%) of these sequences originated from four out of 22 EMR countries, and 65.6% of all sequences belonged to GISAID clades GR, GH, and G. We identified ten common non-synonymous mutations represented among SARS-CoV-2 in the EMR and several country-specific ones. Two substitutions, S_D614G and NSP12_P323L, were predominant in most countries. Contrary to previous studies, these substitutions were not consistently associated with increased case fatality rates across the Region. Our study identified critical data gaps in EMR highlighting the importance of enhancing surveillance and sequencing capacities in the region.

319,Continued need for non-pharmaceutical interventions after COVID-19 vaccination in long-term-care facilities,"Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) bear disproportionate burden of COVID-19 and are prioritized for vaccine deployment. LTCF outbreaks could continue occurring during vaccine rollout due to incomplete population coverage, and the effect of vaccines on viral transmission are currently unknown. Declining adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against within-facility transmission could therefore limit the effectiveness of vaccination. We built a stochastic model to simulate outbreaks in LTCF populations with differing vaccination coverage and NPI adherence to evaluate their interacting effects. Vaccination combined with strong NPI adherence produced the least morbidity and mortality. Healthcare worker vaccination improved outcomes in unvaccinated LTCF residents but was less impactful with declining NPI adherence. To prevent further illness and deaths, there is a continued need for NPIs in LTCFs during vaccine rollout.",Jay Love; Lindsay T Keegan; Frederick J Angulo; John McLaughlin; Kimberly M Shea; David L Swerdlow; Matthew H Samore; Damon JA Toth,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249339,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249339,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
320,Indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic at two tertiary neonatal units in Zimbabwe and Malawi: an interrupted time series analysis,"BackgroundDeaths from COVID-19 have exceeded 1.8 million globally (January 2020). We examined trends in markers of neonatal care before and during the pandemic at two tertiary neonatal units in Zimbabwe and Malawi.

MethodsWe analysed data collected prospectively via the NeoTree app at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital (SMCH), Zimbabwe, and Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), Malawi. Neonates admitted from 1 June 2019 to 25 September 2020 were included. We modelled the impact of the first cases of COVID-19 (Zimbabwe: 20 March 2020; Malawi: 3 April 2020) on number of admissions, gestational age and birth weight, source of admission referrals, prevalence of neonatal encephalopathy, and overall mortality.

FindingsThe study included 3,450 neonates at SMCH and 3,350 neonates at KCH. Admission numbers at SMCH did not initially change after the first case of COVID-19 but fell by 48% during a nurses strike (Relative risk (RR) 0{middle dot}52, 95%CI 0{middle dot}40-0{middle dot}68, p < 0{middle dot}002). At KCH, admissions dropped by 42% (RR 0{middle dot}58; 95%CI 0{middle dot}48-0{middle dot}70; p < 0{middle dot}001) soon after the first case of COVID-19. At KCH, gestational age and birth weight decreased slightly (1 week, 300 grams), outside referrals dropped by 28%, and there was a slight weekly increase in mortality. No changes in these outcomes were found at SMCH.

InterpretationThe indirect impacts of COVID-19 are context-specific. While this study provides vital evidence to inform health providers and policy makers, national data are required to ascertain the true impacts of the pandemic on newborn health.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for evidence of the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neonatal care in low-income settings using the search terms neonat* or newborn, and COVID-19 or SARS-CoV 2 or coronavirus, and the Cochrane low and middle income country (LMIC) filters, with no language limits between 01.10.2019 and 21.11.20. While there has been a decrease in global neonatal mortality rates, the smaller improvements seen in low-income settings are threatened by the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A modelling study of this threat predicted between 250000-1.1 million extra neonatal deaths as a result of decreased service provision and access in LMICs. A webinar and survey of frontline maternal/newborn healthcare workers in >60 countries reported a decline in both service attendance and in quality of service across the ante-, peri- and post-natal journey. Reporting fear of attending services, and difficulty in access, and a decrease in service quality due to exacerbation of existing service weaknesses, confusion over guidelines and understaffing. Similar findings were reported in a survey of healthcare workers providing childhood and maternal vaccines in LMICs. One study to date has reported data from Nepal describing an increase in stillbirths and neonatal deaths, with institutional deliveries nearly halved during lockdown.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first and only study in Sub-Saharan Africa describing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health service access and outcomes for newborns in two countries. We analysed data from the digital quality improvement and data collection tool, the NeoTree, to carry out an interrupted time series analysis of newborn admission rates, gestational age, birth weight, diagnosis of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and mortality from two large hospitals in Malawi and Zimbabwe (n[~]7000 babies). We found that the indirect impacts of COVID-19 were context-specific. In Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Zimbabwe, initial resilience was demonstrated in that there was no evidence of change in mortality, birth weight or gestational age. In comparison, at Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi, soon after the first case of COVID-19, the data revealed a fall in admissions (by 42%), gestational age (1 week), birth weight (300 grams), and outside referrals (by 28%), and there was a slight weekly increase in mortality (2%). In the Zimbabwean hospital, admission numbers did not initially change after the first case of COVID-19 but fell by 48% during a nurses strike, which in itself was in response to challenges exacerbated by the pandemic.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur data confirms the reports from frontline healthcare workers of a perceived decline in neonatal service access and provision in LMICs. Digital routine healthcare data capture enabled rapid profiling of indirect impacts of COVID-19 on newborn care and outcomes in two tertiary referral hospitals, Malawi and Zimbabwe. While a decrease in service access was seen in both countries, the impacts on care provided and outcome differed by national context. Health systems strengthening, for example digital data capture, may assist in planning context-specific mitigation efforts.",Simbarashe Chimhuya; Samuel R Neal; Gwendoline Chimhini; Hannah Gannon; Mario Cortina Borja; Caroline Crehan; Deliwe Nkhoma; Tarisai Chiume; Emma Wilson; Tim Hull-Bailey; Felicity Fitzgerald; Msandeni Chiume; Michelle Heys,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249322,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249322,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
321,"Construction of a demand and capacity model for intensive care and hospital ward beds, and mortality from COVID-19","BackgroundThis paper describes the construction of a model used to estimate the number of excess deaths that could be expected as a direct consequence of a lack of hospital bed and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity.

MethodsA series of compartmental models was used to estimate the number of deaths under different combinations of care required (ICU or ward), and care received (ICU, ward or no care) in England up to the end of April 2021. Model parameters were sourced from publicly available government information, organisations collating COVID-19 data and calculations using existing parameters. A compartmental sub-model was used to estimate the mortality scalars that represent the increase in mortality that would be expected from a lack of provision of an ICU or general ward bed when one is required. Three illustrative scenarios for admissions numbers,  Optimistic,  Middling and  Pessimistic, are described showing how the model can be used to estimate mortality rates under different scenarios of capacity.

ResultsThe key output of our collaboration was the model itself rather than the results of any of the scenarios. The model allows a user to understand the excess mortality impact arising as a direct consequence of capacity being breached under various scenarios or forecasts of hospital admissions. The scenarios described in this paper are illustrative and are not forecasts.

There were no excess deaths from a lack of capacity in any of the  Optimistic scenario applications in sensitivity analysis.

Several of the  Middling scenario applications under sensitivity testing resulted in excess deaths directly attributable to a lack of capacity. Most excess deaths arose when we modelled a 20% reduction compared to best estimate ICU capacity. This led to 597 deaths (0.7% increase).

All the  Pessimistic scenario applications under sensitivity analysis had excess deaths. These ranged from 49,219 (19.4% increase) when we modelled a 20% increase in ward bed availability over the best-estimate, to 103,845 (40.9% increase) when we modelled a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability below the best-estimate. The emergence of a new, more transmissible variant (VOC 202012/01) increases the likelihood of real world outcomes at, or beyond, those modelled in our  Pessimistic scenario.

The results can be explained by considering how capacity evolves in each of the scenarios. In the Middling scenario, whilst ICU capacity may be approached and even possibly breached, there remains sufficient ward capacity to take lives who need either ward or ICU support, keeping excess deaths relatively low. However, the Pessimistic scenario sees ward capacity breached, and in many scenarios for a period of several weeks, resulting in much higher mortality in those lives who require care but do not receive it.

ConclusionsNo excess deaths from breaching capacity would be expected under the unadjusted  Optimistic assumptions of demand. The  Middling scenario could result in some excess deaths from breaching capacity, though these would be small (0.7% increase) relative to the total number of deaths in that scenario. The  Pessimistic scenario would certainly result in significant excess deaths from breaching capacity. Our sensitivity analysis indicated a range between 49,219 (19.4% increase) and 103,845 (40.9% increase) excess deaths.

Without the new variant, exceeding capacity for hospital and ICU beds did not appear to be the most likely outcome but given the new variant it now appears more plausible and, if so, would result in a substantial increase in the number of deaths from COVID-19.",Stuart McDonald; Christopher John Martin; Steve Bale; Michiel Luteijn; Rahuldeb Sarkar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249341,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249341,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
322,Evaluation of at-home methods for N95 filtering facepiece respirator decontamination,"Shortages in N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are significant as FFRs are essential for the protection of healthcare professionals and other high-risk groups against Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In response to these shortages during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) permitting FFR decontamination and reuse. However, although industrial decontamination services are available at some large institutions, FFR decontamination is not widely available.

Effective FFR decontamination must 1) deactivate the virus; 2) preserve FFR integrity, specifically fit and filtering capability; and 3) be non-toxic and safe. Here we identify and compare at-home methods for heat-based FFR decontamination that meet these requirements, but utilize common household appliances. Our results identify viable protocols for simple and accessible FFR decontamination, while also highlighting methods that may jeopardize FFR integrity and should be avoided.

323,Heterogeneity versus the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In this paper, heterogeneity is formally defined, and its properties are explored. We define and distinguish observable versus non-observable heterogeneity. It is proposed that heterogeneity among the vulnerable is a significant factor in the contagion impact of COVID-19, as demonstrated with incidence rates on a Diamond Princess Cruise ship in February 2020. Given the nature of the disease, its heterogeneity and human social norms, pre-voyage and post-voyage quick testing procedures may become the new standard for cruise ship passengers and crew. The technological advances in testing available today would facilitate more humanistic treatment as compared to more archaic quarantine and isolation practices for all onboard ship. With quick testing, identification of those infected and thus not allowed to embark on a cruise or quarantining those disembarking and other mitigation strategies, the popular cruise adventure could be available safely again.

324,Complex Systems Analysis Informs on the Spread of COVID-19,"The non-linear progression of new infection numbers in a pandemic poses challenges to the evaluation of its management. The tools of complex systems research may aid in attaining information that would be difficult to extract with other means. To study the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilize the reported new cases per day for the globe, nine countries and six US states through October 2020. Fourier and univariate wavelet analyses inform on periodicity and extent of change. Evaluating time-lagged data sets of various lag lengths, we find that the autocorrelation function, average mutual information and box counting dimension represent good quantitative readouts for the progression of new infections. Bivariate wavelet analysis and return plots give indications of containment versus exacerbation. Homogeneity or heterogeneity in the population response, uptick versus suppression, and worsening or improving trends are discernible, in part by plotting various time lags in three dimensions.

325,Incidence and Characteristics of Co-infection and Secondary Infection in Patients with COVID-19,"ObjectiveThe etiology and epidemiology of co-infection and secondary infection in COVID-19 patients remain unknown. The study aims to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of co-infection and secondary infection in COVID-19 patients, mainly focusing on Streptococcus pneumoniae co-infections.

MethodsThis study was a prospective, observational cohort study of the inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 in two designated hospitals in south China enrolled between Jan 11 and Feb 22, 2020. The urine specimen was collected on admission and applied for pneumococcal urinary antigen tests (PUATs). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data of patients were recorded simultaneously.

ResultA total of 146 patients with a confirm diagnosis of COVID-19 at the median age of 50.0 years (IQR 36.0-61.0) were enrolled, in which, 16 (11.0%) were classified as severe cases and 130 (89.0%) as non-severe cases. Of the enrolled patients, only 3 (2.1%) were considered to present the co-infection, in which 1 was co-infected with S.pneumoniae, 1 with B. Ovatus infection and the other one with Influenza A virus infection. Secondary infection occurred in 16 patients, with S. maltophilia as the most commonly isolated pathogen (43.8%), followed by P. aeruginosa (25.0%), E. aerogenes (25.0%), C. parapsilosis (25.0%) and A. fumigates (18.8%).

326,The Effect of Frames on COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy,"In order to control the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it will be important to develop a communication strategy to counteract ""vaccine hesitancy"". This paper reports the results of a survey experiment testing the impacts of several types of message content: the safety and efficacy of the vaccine itself, the likelihood that others will take the vaccine, and the possible role of politics in promoting the vaccine. In an original survey of 1123 American M-Turk respondents, we provided six different information conditions suggesting the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, the lack of safety/efficacy of the vaccine, the suggestion that most others would take the vaccine, the suggestion that most others would not take the vaccine, the suggestion that the vaccine is being promoted to gain greater control over individual freedom, and the suggestion that it is being rushed for political motivations. We compared the responses for those in the treatment groups with a control group who received no additional information. In comparison to the control group, those who received information about the safety/efficacy of the vaccine were more likely to report that they would take the vaccine, those who received information that others were reluctant to take the vaccine were more likely to report that they themselves would not take it, that other Americans would not take it, and that it was not important to get the vaccine, and those who received information about political influences on vaccine development expressed hesitancy to take it.

MethodsA systematic review of randomized clinical trials, observational studies and case series published in PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and CENTRAL from December 1, 2019 to March 25, 2020. Studies of adult patients with COVID-19 that reported at least one hemostatic laboratory parameter were included.

ResultsData were extracted from 57 studies (N=12,050 patients) that met inclusion criteria. The average age of patients was 52 years and 45% were women. Of the included studies, 92.7% (N=38/41 studies) reported an average platelet count [&ge;] 150 x 109/L, 68.2% (N=15/22 studies) reported an average prothrombin time (PT) between 11-14 s, 55% (N=11/20 studies) reported an average activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) between 25-35 s, and 34.4% (N=11/32 studies) reported a D-dimer concentration above the upper limit of normal (ULN). Eight studies (7 cohorts and 1 case series) reported hemostatic lab values for survivors versus non-survivors. Among non-survivors, D-dimer concentrations were reported in 4 studies and all reported an average above the ULN.

328,Use of the FebriDx point-of-care assay as part of a triage algorithm for medical admissions with possible COVID-19,"BackgroundPatients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 must be rapidly identified and isolated to prevent nosocomial transmission. However, isolation facilities are often limited, and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results are too slow to inform emergency department triage. We evaluated a pragmatic triage algorithm to isolate patients with suspected COVID-19 using simple clinical criteria and the FebriDx assay.

MethodsAll medical admissions in a large UK hospital were triaged as likely, possible or unlikely COVID-19 based on clinical criteria. Patients triaged as possible COVID-19 underwent FebriDx lateral flow assay on capillary blood, and those who tested MxA positive were isolated. We evaluated the accuracy of the algorithm and the FebriDx assay compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs as the reference standard.

ResultsBetween 10th August 2020 and 4th November 2020, 136/3,443 medical admissions (4.0%) were diagnosed with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. Prevalence of COVID-19 was 45.7% (80/175) in those triaged as likely, 4.1% (50/1,225) in possible and 6/2,033 (0.3%) in unlikely COVID-19. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, clinical triage had sensitivity of 95.6% (130/136) and specificity of 61.5% (2027/3297), whilst the triage algorithm including FebriDx had sensitivity of 92.6% (126/136) and specificity of 86.4% (2849/3297). The triage algorithm reduced the need for 2,859 patients to be admitted to isolation rooms. The patients missed by the algorithm had mild or asymptomatic COVID-19.

ConclusionsA simple triage algorithm including FebriDx assay had good sensitivity and is a useful  rule-out for COVID-19. The algorithm is useful for managing medical admissions from the emergency department.

SummaryWe studied a COVID-19 triage algorithm for hospital medical admissions using clinical parameters and the FebriDx assay.

329,Reverse Transcriptase Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for COVID-19 Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BackgroundCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a severe outbreak and become a global public health priority. Rapid increment of infection number along with significant deaths have placed the virus as a serious threat to human health. Rapid, reliable, and simple diagnostic methods are critically essential for disease control. While Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the current diagnostic gold standard, Reverse Transcriptase Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) appears as a compelling alternative diagnostic test due to its more simplicity, shorter time to result, and lower cost. This study examined RT-LAMP application for rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR assay.

MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis (2020) was conducted in 6 scientific databases following the PRISMA Guideline. Original published studies on human clinical samples in English were included. Articles evaluated sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP relative to RT-PCR were considered eligible. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was examined based on QUADAS-2.

ResultsA total of 351 studies were found based on the keywords and search queries. 14 eligible case control studies fitted the respective criteria. Quality assessment using QUADAS-2 indicated low risk bias in all included studies. All case studies, comprises 2,112 samples, had the cumulative sensitivity of 95.5% (CI 97.5%=90.8-97.9%) and cumulative specificity of 99.5% (CI 97.5%=97.7-99.9%).

Moreover, the models trained by our approach offer insights into the spread of COVID-19, such as the association between the baseline transmission rate and the state-level demographics, the effectiveness of local policies in reducing COVID-19 infections, and so on. This work provides a good understanding of COVID-19 evolution with respect to state-level characteristics and can potentially inform local policymakers in devising customized response strategies.",Yifei Wang; Hao Peng; Long Sha; Zheyuan Liu; Pengyu Hong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249218,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249218,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
332,Outbreak or pseudo-outbreak? Integrating SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to validate infection control practices in an end stage renal disease facility,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 poses a particularly high risk for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients and led to a need for facility-wide control plans to prevent introduction and spread of infection within ESRD facilities. Rapid identification of clusters of contemporaneous cases is essential, as these may be indicative of within-facility spread. Nevertheless, in a setting of high community COVID-19 prevalence, a series of ESRD patients may test positive at around the same time without their shared ESRD facility being the nexus for disease spread. Here we describe a series of five cases occurring within an eleven-day period in November 2020 in a hospital-based 32-station ESRD facility in southwest Wisconsin, the subsequent facility-wide testing, and the use of genetic sequence analysis of positive specimens to evaluate whether these cases were linked.

MethodsFour patient cases and one staff case were identified in symptomatic individuals by RT-PCR. Facility-wide screening was initiated at the request of local public health and conducted using Abbot BinaxNOW antigen tests. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from residual diagnostic test specimens using an amplicon-based approach on an Ion Torrent S5 sequencer.

ResultsResidual specimens from 4 of 5 cases were available for sequence analysis. Each sequence was very clearly genetically distinct from the others, indicating that these contemporaneous cases were not linked. Facility-wide screening of 47 staff and 107 patients did not identify any additional cases.

ConclusionsThese data indicate that despite the outward appearance of a case cluster, the facility did not experience within-facility spread nor serve as the epicenter of a new outbreak, suggesting that the enacted rigorous infection control procedures (screening, masking, distancing) practiced stringently by patients and staff were sufficient to permit dialysis to proceed safely in a very high-risk population under pressure from increasing community spread. These data also demonstrate the utility of rapid turnaround SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in outbreak investigations in settings like ESRD facilities.",Bridget L Pfaff; Craig S Richmond; Arick P Sabin; Deena M Athas; Jessica C Adams; Megan E Meller; Kumari Usha; Sarah A Schmitz; Brian J Simmons; Andrew J Borgert; Paraic A Kenny,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249062,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249062,2021-01-06,2021-01-06,,True
333,Modelling COVID -19 Transmission in a Hemodialysis Centre Using Simulation Generated Contacts Matrices,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly threatening to the patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on intermittent hemodialysis and their care providers. Hemodialysis patients who receive life-sustaining medical therapy in healthcare settings, face unique challenges as they need to be at a dialysis unit three or more times a week, where they are confined to specific settings and tended to by dialysis nurses and staff with physical interaction and in close proximity. Despite the importance and critical situation of the dialysis units, modelling studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in these settings are very limited. In this paper, we have used a combination of discrete event and agent-based simulation models, to study the operations of a typical large dialysis unit and generate contact matrices to examine outbreak scenarios. We present the details of the contact matrix generation process and demonstrate how the simulation calculates a micro-scale contact matrix comprising the number and duration of contacts at a micro-scale time step. We have used the contacts matrix in an agent-based model to predict disease transmission under different scenarios. The results show that micro-simulation can be used to estimate contact matrices, which can be used effectively for disease modelling in dialysis and similar settings.",Mohammadali Tofighi; Ali Asgary; Asad A.

335,Covid19Risk.ai: An open source repository and online calculator of prediction models for early diagnosis and prognosis of Covid-19,"ObjectiveThe current pandemic has led to a proliferation of predictive models being developed to address various aspects of COVID-19 patient care. We aimed to develop an online platform that would serve as an open source repository for a curated subset of such models, and provide a simple interface for included models to allow for online calculation. This platform would support doctors during decision-making regarding diagnoses, prognoses, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients, expediting the models transition from research to clinical practice.

MethodsIn this proof-of-principle study, we performed a literature search in PubMed and WHO database to find suitable models for implementation on our platform. All selected models were publicly available (peer reviewed publications or open source repository) and had been validated (TRIPOD type 3 or 2b). We created a method for obtaining the regression coefficients if only the nomogram was available in the original publication. All predictive models were transcribed on a practical graphical user interface using PHP 8.0.0, and published online together with supporting documentation and links to the associated articles.

ResultsThe open source website https://covid19risk.ai/ currently incorporates nine models from six different research groups, evaluated on datasets from different countries. The website will continue to be populated with other models related to COVID-19 prediction as these become available. This dynamic platform allows COVID-19 researchers to contact us to have their model curated and included on our website, thereby increasing the reach and real-world impact of their work.

ConclusionWe have successfully demonstrated in this proof-of-principle study that our website provides an inclusive platform for predictive models related to COVID-19. It enables doctors to supplement their judgment with patient-specific predictions from externally-validated models in a user-friendly format. Additionally, this platform supports researchers in showcasing their work, which will increase the visibility and use of their models.",Iva Halilaj; Avishek Chatterjee; Yvonka  van Wijk; Guangyao Wu; Brice  van Eeckhout; Cary Oberije; Philippe Lambin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425384,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.425384,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,False
336,Syncope and COVID-19 disease - a systematic review.,"BackgroundSyncope is not a common manifestation of COVID-19, but it may occur in this context and it can be the presenting symptom in some cases. Although several mechanisms may explain the pathophysiology behind COVID-19 related syncope, a valid relationship has not been established yet. In this systematic review, we aimed to examine the current incidence of syncope in COVID-19 patients and to explore different patterns observed in this setting.

MethodsA systematic review across PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS was performed, according to PRISMA guidelines, in order to identify all relevant articles regarding both COVID-19 and syncope.

ResultsWe identified 81 publications, of which 62 were excluded. The cumulative incidence of syncope and pre-syncope across the selected studies was 7.1% (256/3584 patients). Unspecified syncope was the most common type (76.2% of the reported episodes), followed by reflex syncope (18.1% of the cases). Orthostatic hypotension was responsible for 3.6% of the cases and syncope of presumable cardiac cause accounted for 2.0%. Arterial hypertension was present in 64.7% of the patients and either angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were used by 39.5% of hypertensive patients with syncope.

ConclusionSyncope, although not considered a typical symptom of the COVID-19 disease, can be associated with it, particularly in early stages. Different types of syncope were seen in this context, each with different implications requiring distinct approaches. A careful reevaluation of blood pressure whenever a patient develops COVID-19 is suggested, including reassessment of antihypertensive therapy.",Raquel Falcao de Freitas; Sofia Cardoso Torres; Jose Pedro L.

337,Hospitalization as reliable indicator of second wave COVID-19 pandemic in eight European countries,"Time dependent reproduction number (Rt) is one of the most popular parameters to track the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. However, especially at the initial stages, Rt can be highly underestimated because of remarkable differences between the actual number of infected people and the daily incidence of people who are tested positive. Here, we present the analysis of daily cumulative number of hospitalized (HP) and intensive care unit (ICU) patients both in space and in time in the early phases of second wave COVID-19 pandemic across eight different European countries, namely Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and United Kingdom. We derive simple model equations to fit the time dependence of these two variables where exponential behavior is observed. Growth rate constants of HP and ICU are listed, providing country-specific parameters able to estimate the burden of SARS-COV-2 infection before extensive containment measures take place. Our quantitative parameters, fully related to hospitalizations, are disentangled from the capacity range of the screening campaign, for example the number of swabs, and they cannot be directly biased by the actual number of infected people. This approach can give an array of reliable indicators which can be used by governments and healthcare systems to monitor the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic.",Mattia Allieta; Davide Rossi Sebastiano,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249084,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249084,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
338,Optimizing testing for COVID-19 in India,"COVID-19 testing across India uses a mix of two types of tests. Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are relatively inexpensive point-of-care lateral-flow-assay tests, but they are also less sensitive. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test has close to 100% sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, but delays in returning results, as well as increased costs relative to RATs, may vitiate this advantage.

India-wide, about 49% of COVID-19 tests are RATs, but some Indian states, including the large states of Uttar Pradesh (pop. 227.9 million) and Bihar (pop. 121.3 million) use a much higher proportion of such tests. Here we show, using simulations based on epidemiological network models, that the judicious use of RATs can yield epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing and isolation of positives, provided a few conditions are met. These are (a) that RAT test sensitivity is not too low, (b) that a reasonably large fraction of the population, of order 0.5% per day, can be tested, (c) that those testing positive are isolated for a sufficient duration, and that (d) testing is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical interventions for increased effectiveness. We assess optimal testing regimes, taking into account test sensitivity and specificity, background seroprevalence and current test pricing. We find, surprisingly, that even 100% RAT test regimes should be acceptable, from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided the conditions outlined above are met.

Author summaryUsing network models, we study optimal ways of combining low sensitivity, relatively inexpensive point-of-care rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 with higher sensitivity but more expensive laboratory RT-PCR tests. We take into account background seroprevalence and current test pricing for such tests in India, finding that even purely rapid antigen test-based regimes can produce the same reduction in overall infections that pure RT-PCR tests are capable of. This is provided one can test at scale and isolate those testing positive effectively, that the sensitivity of the rapid test is not too low and that non-pharmaceutical interventions proceed in parallel for increased effectiveness.",Philip Cherian; Sandeep Krishna; Gautam I Menon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249106,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249106,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
339,"Empty Streets, Speeding and Motor Vehicle Collisions during Covid-19 Lockdowns: Evidence from Northern Ireland","Covid-19 and lockdowns have had spillover effects on other health outcomes. Motor vehicle collisions (MVC) are likely to have been affected by the pandemic due to, among others, less traffic volume and speeding on empty streets. This paper studies the impact of the pandemic on MVCs in Northern Ireland. Using monthly data on injuries and deaths, we find a steep decline in slight and serious injuries compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. However, we find no effect on the number of deaths. Based on data from speeding tickets, a plausible explanation for the differential effect on the number of injuries and deaths is speeding on empty streets during the pandemic.",Sotiris Vandoros; Fotis Papailias,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249173,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249173,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
340,Prediction of confirmed and death cases of Covid-19 in Chile through time series techniques: A comparative study,"(1) BackgroundChile has become one of the countries most affected by Covid-19, a pandemic that has generated a large number of cases worldwide, which if not detected and treated in time can cause multi-organic failure and even death. The social determinants of health such as education, work, social security, housing, environment, support networks and social cohesion are important aspects to consider for the control and intervention of this pathology. Therefore, it is essential to have information about the progress of the infections at the national level and thus apply effective public health interventions. In this paper, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile and thus support the decisions of health agencies;

(2) MethodsWe modeled the confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile by using ARIMA models, exponential smoothing techniques, Poisson models for time-dependent counting data. In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions by using a training set and test set;

(3) ResultsThe database used in this paper allows us to say that for the confirmed Covid-19 cases the best model corresponds to a well-known Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series model, whereas for deaths from Covid-19 in Chile the best model resulted in damped trend method;

341,OPTIMIZING COVID-19 VACCINE USAGE,"As the worldwide vaccination, it is imperative to minimize vaccine wastage by effectively using all doses available. Vaccine wastage can occur at multiple points during the vaccination process, but it is mainly because the device dead space and the filling process technique. However, there are no studies discussing the waste volume effect of COVID-19 vaccines in clinical practice. There is an increasing COVID-19 vaccine demand that we estimate up to several billion dual doses. The objective of this study was to assess the number of 0.3mL doses obtained from a multiple-dose vial using 1ml and 3ml syringes with different type of needles replicating the first COVID-19 vaccination protocol.

Our results suggest that it is possible to obtain six or seven doses from each vial instead five. We provide evidence to optimize between 20% and 40% additional vaccine doses per vial if the current 5-dose vials are used, making scarce supplies go further.

We leverage  augmented curation to extract symptoms and signs occurring post - COVID as noted in follow up physicians notes of COVID-19 patients at the Mayo Clinic who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and September 2020, or influenza between 2014 and 2019. We compare the chart prevalence of signs/symptoms and diseases in the 3-to-6 month post-diagnosis vs. 1-to-6 month pre-diagnosis period for each disease, and subsequently compare the observed effect size of each symptom across the two diseases. Relative to post-influenza, we observe a significant increase in the chart prevalence of terms including ""depression"", ""anxiety"", ""obesity"", and ""bleeding"" in COVID-19 patients under the age of 55. Across all age groups, ""nodules"" and ""cysts"" were also significantly increased.

343,The impact of vitamin D supplementation on mortality rate and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundSeveral studies have suggested the positive impact of vitamin D on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes and mortality rate of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted through the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Embase, Ovid, and The Cochrane Library with no limitation in time and language, until December 16, 2020. The results were screened based on their accordance with the subject. Two independent reviewers selected the eligible studies and the outcomes of interest were extracted. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and Quasi-Experimental Studies, the remaining results were appraised critically. Statistical analysis was performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.0.

ResultsOf the 2311 results, 1305 duplicated results were removed. After screening the titles, abstracts, and the full-text articles of the remaining records, four studies and 259 patients were enrolled, including 139 patients in vitamin D intervention groups. In three of the studies, the patients survival and mortality rate were evaluated. The pooled analysis of these studies showed a significantly lower mortality rate among the intervention groups (10.56%) compared with the control groups (23.88%) (OR = 0.264, 95% CI = 0.099-0.708, p-value = 0.008). Two of the studies reported the clinical outcomes based on the World Health Organizations Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) score for COVID-19, where both of them showed a significant decrease in OSCI score in the vitamin D intervention groups. Additionally, One study reported a lower rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and one study reported a significant decrease in serum levels of Fibrinogen.

344,"The social experience of participation in a COVID-19 vaccine trial: Subjects' motivations, others' concerns, and insights for vaccine promotion","BackgroundVaccine hesitancy could undermine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs. Knowledge about peoples lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake.

AimTo use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process.

MethodsWe interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of peoples lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making.

ResultsParticipants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing ones duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe.

345,Different selection dynamics of S and RdRp between SARS-CoV-2 genomes with and without the dominant mutations,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide, with no dedicated treatment or vaccine currently available. As pharmaceutical research against and the most frequently used tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection both depend on the genomic and peptide sequences of the virus for their efficacy, understanding the mutation rates and content of the virus is critical. Two key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are the S protein, responsible for viral entry into the cells, and RdRp, the RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome. Due to their roles in the viral cycle, these proteins are crucial for the fitness and infectiousness of the virus. Our previous findings had shown that the two most frequently observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14408C>T in the RdRp coding region, and 23403A>G in the S gene, are correlated with higher mutation density over time. In this study, we further detail the selection dynamics and the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 genes, comparing them between isolates carrying both mutations, and isolates carrying neither. We find that the S gene and the RdRp coding region show the highest variance between the genotypes, and their selection dynamics contrast each other over time. The S gene displays higher positive selection in mutant isolates early on, and undergoes increasing negative selection over time, whereas the RdRp region in the mutant isolates shows strong negative selection throughout the pandemic.",Necla Koçhan; Doğa Eskier; Asli Suner; Gökhan Karakülah; Yavuz Oktay,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.20237602,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.20237602,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True
346,Pharmacokinetic modelling to estimate intracellular favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate exposure to support posology for SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe role of favipiravir as a treatment for COVID-19 is unclear, with discrepant activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, concerns about teratogenicity and pill burden, and an unknown optimal dose. In Vero-E6 cells, high concentrations are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this analysis was to use available data to simulate intracellular pharmacokinetics of favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate (FAVI-RTP) to better understand the putative applicability as a COVID-19 intervention.

MethodsPreviously published in vitro data for the intracellular production and elimination of FAVI- RTP in MDCK cells incubated with parent favipiravir was fitted with a mathematical model to describe the time course of intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations as a function of incubation concentration of parent favipiravir. Parameter estimates from this model fitting were then combined with a previously published population PK model for the plasma exposure of parent favipiravir in Chinese patients with severe influenza (the modelled free plasma concentration of favipiravir substituting for in vitro incubation concentration) to predict the human intracellular FAVI-RTP pharmacokinetics.

ResultsIn vitro FAVI-RTP data was adequately described as a function of in vitro incubation media concentrations of parent favipiravir with an empirical model, noting that the model simplifies and consolidates various processes and is used under various assumptions and within certain limits. Parameter estimates from the fittings to in vitro data predict a flatter dynamic range of peak to trough for intracellular FAVI-RTP when driven by a predicted free plasma concentration profile.

ConclusionThis modelling approach has several important limitations that are discussed in the main text of the manuscript. However, the simulations indicate that despite rapid clearance of the parent drug from plasma, sufficient intracellular FAVI-RTP may be maintained across the dosing interval because of its long intracellular half-life. Population average intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations are estimated to maintain the Km for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase for 3 days following 800 mg BID dosing and 9 days following 1200 mg BID dosing after a 1600 mg BID loading dose on day 1.

347,Prior Bariatric Surgery in COVID-19 Positive Patients May Be Protective,"IntroductionPatients infected with novel COVID-19 virus have a spectrum of illnesses ranging from asymptomatic to death. Data has shown that age, gender and obesity are strongly correlated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients. Bariatric surgery is the only treatment that provides significant, sustained weight loss in the severely obese. We look at whether prior bariatric surgery correlates with increased risk of hospitalization and outcome severity after COVID-19 infection.

MethodsA cross-sectional retrospective analysis of a COVID-19 database from a single, NYC-based, academic institution was conducted. A cohort of COVID-19 positive patients with a history of bariatric surgery (n=124) were matched in a 4:1 ratio to a control cohort of COVID-19 positive patients who were eligible for bariatric surgery (BMI [&ge;]40 kg/m2 or BMI [&ge;]35 kg/m2 with a comorbidity) (n=496). A comparison of outcomes, including mechanical ventilation requirements and deceased at discharge, was done between cohorts using Chi-square test or Fishers exact test. Additionally, overall length of stay and duration of time in ICU were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Conditional logistic regression analyses were done to determine both unadjusted (UOR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR).

ResultsA total of 620 COVID-19 positive patients were included in this analysis. The categorization of bariatric surgeries included 36% Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB, n=45), 35% laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, n=44), and 28% laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n=35). The body mass index (BMI) for the bariatric group was 36.1 kg/m2 (SD=8.3), which was significantly lower than the control group, 41.4 kg/m2 (SD=6.5) (p<0.0001). There was also less burden of diabetes in the bariatric group (32%) compared to the control group (48%) (p=0.0019). Patients with a history of bariatric surgery were less likely to be admitted through the emergency room (UOR=0.39, p=0.0001), less likely to have had a ventilator used during the admission (UOR=0.42, p=0.028), had a shorter length of stay in both the ICU (p=0.033) and overall (UOR=0.44, p=0.0002), and were less likely to be deceased at discharge compared to the control group (OR=0.42, p=0.028).

348,COVID-HEART: Development and Validation of a Multi-Variable Model for Real-Time Prediction of Cardiovascular Complications in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,"Cardiovascular (CV) manifestations of COVID-19 infection carry significant morbidity and mortality. Current risk prediction for CV complications in COVID-19 is limited and existing approaches fail to account for the dynamic course of the disease. Here, we develop and validate the COVID-HEART predictor, a novel continuously-updating risk prediction technology to forecast CV complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The risk predictor is trained and tested with retrospective registry data from 2178 patients to predict two outcomes: cardiac arrest and imaging-confirmed thromboembolic events. In repeating model validation many times, we show that it predicts cardiac arrest with an average median early warning time of 18 hours (IQR: 13-20 hours) and an AUROC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91-0.92), and thromboembolic events with a median early warning time of 72 hours (IQR: 12-204 hours) and an AUROC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.67-0.73).

349,Optimizing vaccine allocation for COVID-19 vaccines: critical role of single-dose vaccination.,"Most COVID-19 vaccines require two doses, and current vaccine prioritization guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines assume full-dose vaccine deployment. However in the context of limited vaccine supply and an expanding pandemic, policymakers are considering single-dose vaccination as an alternative strategy. Using a mathematical model combined with optimization algorithms, we determined the optimal allocation with one and two doses of vaccine to minimize five metrics of disease burden under various degrees of viral transmission. Under low transmission, we show that the optimal allocation of vaccine critically depends on the level of single-dose efficacy (SDE). If the SDE is high, single-dose vaccination is optimal, preventing up to 36% more deaths than a strategy prioritizing full-dose vaccination for older adults first. With low or moderate SDE, mixed vaccination campaigns with coverage of all older adults with one dose are optimal. However, with modest or high transmission, vaccinating older adults first with two doses is best, preventing up to 41% more deaths than a single-dose vaccination given across all populations. Further, we show that maintaining social distancing interventions and speedy deployment are key for effective vaccination campaigns. Our work suggests that it is imperative to determine the efficacy and durability of single-dose vaccines, as mixed or single-dose vaccination campaigns may have the potential to contain the pandemic much more quickly.",Laura Matrajt; Julia Eaton; Tiffany Leung; Dobromir Dimitrov; Joshua T Schiffer; David A Swan; Holly Janes,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249099,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249099,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True

351,COVID-19 immunization threshold(s): an analysis,"2As COVID-19 vaccine research efforts seem to be yielding the first tangible results, the proportion of individuals needed to reap the benefits of herd immunity is a key element from a Public Health programs perspective.

This magnitude, termed the critical immunization threshold (q), can be obtained from the classical SIR model equilibrium equation, equaling (1 - 1/R0)/ {epsilon}, where R0 is the basic reproduction number and{epsilon} is the vaccine efficacy. When a significant proportion of the population is already immune, this becomes (n - 1/R0)/ {epsilon}, where n is the proportion of non-immune individuals. A similar equation can be obtained for short-term immunization thresholds(qt), which are dependent on Rt.

qs for most countries are between 60-75% of the population. Current qt for most countries are between 20-40%.

Therefore, the combination of gradual vaccination and other non-pharmaceutical interventions will mark the transition to the herd immunity, providing that the later turns out to be a feasible objective.

As of 28 November 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with a total of more than 6,171,5119 confirmed infections and more than 1,44,4235 confirmed deaths reported worldwide. The main focus of this paper is to generate LTM real-time out of sample forecasts of the future COVID-19 confirmed and death cases respectively for the top ten profoundly affected countries including for the world. To solve this problem we introduced a novel hybrid approach AARNN model based on ARIMA and ARNN forecasting model that can generate LTM (fifty days ahead) out of sample forecasts of the number of daily confirmed and death COVID-19 cases for the ten countries namely USA, India, Brazil, Russia, France, Spain, UK, Italy, Argentina, Colombia and also for the world respectively.

353,Value of radiomics features from adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images predicting COVID-19 progression,"BackgroundValue of radiomics features from the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images for predicting disease progression in patients with COVID-19 has not been studied.

MethodsA total of 1,245 patients (685 moderate and 560 severe patients) were enrolled in a retrospective study. We proposed 3D V-Net to segment adrenal glands in onset CT images automatically, and periadrenal fat was obtained using inflation operation around the adrenal gland. Next, we built a clinical model (CM), three radiomics models (adrenal gland model [AM], periadrenal fat model [PM], and fusion of adrenal gland and periadrenal fat model [FM]), and radiomics nomogram (RN) after radiomics features extracted to predict disease progression in patients with COVID-19.

ResultsThe auto-segmentation framework yielded a dice value of 0.79 in the training set. CM, AM, PM, FM, and RN obtained AUCs of 0.712, 0.692, 0.763, 0.791, and 0.806, respectively in the training set. FM and RN had better predictive efficacy than CM (P < 0.0001) in the training set. RN showed that there was no significant difference in the validation set (mean absolute error [MAE] = 0.04) and test set (MAE = 0.075) between predictive and actual results. Decision curve analysis showed that if the threshold probability was more than 0.3 in the validation set or between 0.4 and 0.8 in the test set, it could gain more net benefits using RN than FM and CM.

ConclusionRadiomics features extracted from the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images may predict progression in patients with COVID-19.

354,"The incidence, characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women hospitalized with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK from March to September 2020: a national cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS)","BackgroundEvidence on risk factors, incidence and impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant mothers and their babies has rapidly expanded but there is a lack of population level data to inform accurate incidence rates and unbiased descriptions of characteristics and outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to describe the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in the UK compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2 in order to inform future clinical guidance and management.

Methods and FindingsWe conducted a national, prospective cohort study of all hospitalized pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 1st March 2020 to 31st August 2020 using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) across all 194 hospitals in the UK with a consultant-led maternity unit. Incidence was estimated using the latest national maternity data. Overall, 1148 hospitalized women had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, 63% of which were symptomatic. Therefore, the estimated incidence of hospitalization with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 2.0 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.9-2.2) and for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 1.2 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.1-1.4). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, women hospitalized with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be overweight or obese (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39-2.48 and aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.53-2.29 respectively), to be of Black, Asian or Other minority ethnic group (aOR 6.24, 95% CI 3.93-9.90, aOR 4.36, 95% CI 3.19-5.95 and aOR 12.95, 95% CI 4.93-34.01 respectively), and to have a relevant medical comorbidity (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.32-2.54). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 57.67, 95% CI 7.80-426.70) but the absolute risk of poor outcomes was low. Cesarean births and neonatal unit admission were increased regardless of symptom status (symptomatic aOR 2.60, 95% CI 1.97-3.42 and aOR 3.08, 95% CI 1.99-4.77 respectively; asymptomatic aOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.52-2.70 and aOR 1.84, 95% 1.12-3.03 respectively). Iatrogenic preterm births were more common in women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (aOR 11.43, 95% CI 5.07-25.75). The risks of stillbirth or neonatal death were not significantly increased, regardless of symptom status but numbers were small. The limitations of this study include the restriction to women hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2, who may by nature of their admission have been at greater risk of adverse outcome.

ConclusionsWe have identified factors that increase the risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. The increased risks of cesarean and iatrogenic preterm birth provide clear evidence of the indirect impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mothers and maternity care in high income settings. Clinicians can be reassured that the majority of women do not experience severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and women with mild disease can be discharged to continue their pregnancy safely.",Nicola Vousden; Kathryn Bunch; Edward Morris; Nigel Simpson; Christopher Gale; Patrick O'Brien; Maria Quigley; Peter Brocklehurst; Jennifer J Kurinczuk; Marian Knight,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249195,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249195,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,True

This study aimed to evaluate cell lines commonly used in virus diagnosis and isolation for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. While multiple kidney cell lines from monkeys were susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2, many cell types derived from human, dog, mink, cat, mouse, or chicken were not. Analysis of MDCK cells, which are most commonly used for surveillance and study of influenza viruses, demonstrated that they were insusceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that the cellular barrier to productive infection was due to low expression level of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and lower receptor affinity to SARS-CoV-2 spike, which could be overcome by over-expression of canine ACE2 in trans.

However, IFNa alone was insufficient to completely abolish SARS-CoV-2 replication. Combinations of IFNa with camostat, remdesivir, EIDD-2801, cycloheximide or convalescent serum showed strong synergy and effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection.

357,Crystallographic molecular replacement using an in silico-generated search model of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8,"The majority of crystal structures are determined by the method of molecular replacement (MR). The range of application of MR is limited mainly by the need for an accurate search model. In most cases, pre-existing experimentally determined structures are used as search models. In favorable cases, ab initio predicted structures have yielded search models adequate for molecular replacement. The ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents a challenging case for MR using an ab initio prediction because ORF8 has an all {beta}-sheet fold and few orthologs. We previously determined experimentally the structure of ORF8 using the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing method, having been unable to find an MR solution to the crystallographic phase problem. Following a report of an accurate prediction of the ORF8 structure, we assessed whether the predicted model would have succeeded as an MR search model.

Multiple efforts are being performed to control this disease. Vaccinations are already in progress. However, no effective treatments have been found so far. The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that through the Spike protein interacts with its cell surface receptor ACE2 to enter into the host cells. Therefore, compounds able to block this interaction may help to stop disease progression. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of compounds reported to interact and modify the activity of ACE2 on the binding of the Spike protein. Among the compounds tested, we found that hydroxyzine could inhibit the binding of the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein to ACE2 in a qualitative in vitro assay. This finding supports the reported clinical data showing the benefits of hydroxyzine on COVID-19 patients, raising the need for further investigation into its effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 given its well-characterized medical properties and affordable cost.",Maria Dolores Rivas; Jose Maria Rafael Saponi-Cortes; Jose Zamorano,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.424792,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.424792,2021-01-05,2021-01-05,,False

A broad deployment of effective immunization campaigns to achieve population immunity at global scale will depend on the biological and logistical attributes of the vaccine. Here, two adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based vaccine candidates demonstrate potent immunogenicity in mouse and nonhuman primates following a single injection. Peak neutralizing antibody titers remain sustained at 5 months and are complemented by functional memory T-cells responses. The AAVrh32.33 capsid of the AAVCOVID vaccine is an engineered AAV to which no relevant pre-existing immunity exists in humans.

361,Molecular Mechanism of the N501Y Mutation for Enhanced Binding between SARS-CoV-2's Spike Protein and Human ACE2 Receptor,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an ongoing global pandemic for over a year. Recently, an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.7) with an unusually large number of mutations had become highly contagious and wide-spreading in United Kingdom. From genome analysis, the N501Y mutation within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2s spike protein might have enhanced the viral proteins binding with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The latter is the prelude for the virus entry into host cells. So far, the molecular mechanism of this enhanced binding is still elusive, which prevents us from assessing its effects on existing therapeutic antibodies. Using all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that Y501 in mutated RBD can be well coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, increasing the overall binding affinity between RBD and hACE2 by about 0.81 kcal/mol. We further explored how the N501Y mutation might affect the binding between a neutralizing antibody (CB6) and RBD. We expect that our work can help researchers design proper measures responding to this urgent virus mutation, such as adding a modified/new neutralizing antibody specifically targeting at this variant in the therapeutic antibody cocktail.

362,In-Vitro Fluorescence Microscopy Studies Show Retention of Spike-Protein (SARS-Cov-2) on Cell Membrane in the Presence of Amodiaquin Dihydrochloride Dihydrate Drug,"The ability of S-glycoprotein (S-protein) in SARS-Cov-2 to bind to the host cell receptor protein (angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) leading to its entry in cellular system determines its contagious index and global spread. Three available drugs (Riboflavin, Amodiaquin dihydrochloride dihydrate (ADD) and Remidesivir) were investigated to understand the kinetics of S-protein and its entry inside a cellular environment. Optical microscopy and fluorescence-based assays on 293T cells (transfected with ACE2 plasmid) were used as the preamble for assessing the behaviour of S-protein in the presence of these drugs for the first 12 hours post S-protein - ACE2 binding. Preliminary results suggest relatively long retention of S-protein on the cell membrane in the presence of ADD drug. Evident from the %-overlap and colocalization of S-protein with endosome studies, a large fraction of S-protein entering the cell escape endosomal degradation process, suggesting S-protein takes non-endocytic mediated entry in the presence of ADD, whereas in the presence of Riboflavin, S-protein carry out normal endocytic pathway, comparable to control (no drug) group. Therefore, present study indicates ADD potentially affects S-proteins entry mechanism (endocytic pathway) in addition to its reported target action mechanism. Hence, ADD substantially interfere with S-protein cellular entrance mechanism. However, further detailed studies at molecular scale will clarify our understanding of exact intermediate molecular processes.

With the aim of decentralizing early treatment to family practitioners, we addressed the question: Can early home treatment with AZM alone or with zinc help prevent hospitalisation, death, and long-COVID-19?

MethodologyWe conducted a scoping review of articles published from 31st December 2019 to 5th November 2020 in Pubmed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv databases, and a review of undergoing clinical trials published in the Clinicaltrial.gov database.

ResultsMany studies report on outpatient treatment with a combination of AZM + HCQ versus AZM alone, and few studies propose the addition of Zinc (Zn) to AZM. In addition, we identified 5 clinical trials currently recruiting individuals for early outpatient treatment with AZM. However, we failed in identifying any study or clinical trial conducted with family practitioners responding to our question.

DiscussionThe antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory benefits of AZM + Zn make this drugs combination a good candidate therapy to treat flu-like-COVID-19 and atypical pneumoniae. The antibacterial action of AZM can also help disrupting the bacteria/virus cooperation that is poorly documented. Considering pros and cons of macrolide use (including antimicrobial resistance), we call for early use of this therapy by family practitioners for home treatment of individuals presenting mild or moderate symptoms under rigorous scientific guidance to prevent hospitalisation, death and long-COVID.",Philippe LEPERE; Bruno Escarguel; Selda Yolartiran; Claude Escarguel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248975,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248975,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
365,"Postlockdown Dynamics of COVID-19 in New York, Florida, Arizona, and Wisconsin","The COVID-19 pandemic is widely studied as it continues to threaten many populations of people especially in the USA, the leading country in terms of both deaths and cases. More and more reports show that the spread of COVID-19 involves infected individuals first passing through a pre-symptomatic infectious stage in addition to the incubation period and that many of the infectious individuals are asymptomatic. In this study, we design and use a mathematical model to primarily address the question of who are the main drivers of COVID-19 - the symptomatic infectious or the presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious in the states of Florida, Arizona, New York, Wisconsin and the entire United States. We emphasize the benefit of lockdown by showing that for all four states, earlier and later lockdown dates decrease the number of cumulative deaths. This benefit of lockdown is also evidenced by the decrease in the infectious cases for Arizona and the entire US when lockdown is implemented earlier. When comparing the influence of the symptomatic infectious versus the presympomatic/asymptomatic infectious, it is shown that, in general, the larger contribution comes from the latter group. This is seen from several perspectives (1) in terms of daily cases, (2) in terms of daily cases when the influence of one group is targeted over the other by setting the effective contact rate(s) for the non-targeted group to zero, and (3) in terms of cumulative cases and deaths for the US and Arizona when the influence of one group is targeted over the other by setting the effective contact rate(s) for the non-targeted group to zero. The consequences of the difference in the contributions of the two infectious groups is simulated in terms of testing and these simulations show that an increase in testing and isolating for the presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group has more impact than an increase in testing for the symptomatic infectious. For example, for the entire US, a 50% increase in testing for the presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group results in a 35% decrease in deaths as opposed to a lower 6% decrease in deaths when a 50% increase in testing rate for the symptomatic infectious is implemented. We also see that if the testing for infectious symptomatic is kept at the baseline value and the testing for the presymptomatic and asymptomatic is increased from 0.2 to 0.25, then the control reproduction number falls well below 1. On the other hand, to get even close to such a result when keeping the presymptomatic and asymptomatic at baseline fitted values, the symptomatic infectious testing rate must be increased considerably more - from 0.25 to 1.7. Lastly, we use our model to simulate an implementation of a natural herd immunity strategy for the entire U.S. and for the state of Wisconsin (the most recent epicenter) and we find that such a strategy requires a significant number of deaths and as such is questionable in terms of success. We conclude with a brief summary of our results and some implications regarding COVID-19 control and mitigation strategies.",Shery Scott; Keisha Cook; Kamal Barley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248967,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248967,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
366,Global surveillance of potential antiviral drug resistance in SARS-CoV-2: proof of concept focussing on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have involved many repurposed drugs. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, encoded by nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) has been targeted by numerous inhibitors with debated clinical impact. Among these, remdesivir has been conditionally approved for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Although the emergence of antiviral resistance, an indirect proxy for antiviral efficacy, poses a considerable healthcare threat, an evolutionary perspective on emerging resistant mutants is still lacking.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is under purifying selection, that potential escape mutations are rare, and unlikely to lead to viral fitness loss.

In more than 56,000 viral genomes from 105 countries dating from December 2019 to July 2020 we found negative selective pressure affecting nsp12 (Tajimas D = -2.62), with potential antiviral escape mutations in only 0.3% of sequenced genomes. Those affected known key residues, such as Nsp12:Val473 and Nsp12:Arg555. Of the potential escape mutations found globally, in silico structural models show that this rarely implies loss of stability in RdRp. No potential escape mutation were found in our local cohort of remdesivir treated patients from the first wave (n=8). Our results indicate that RdRp is a suitable drug target, and that remdesivir does not seem to exert high selective pressure. Our study could be the starting point of a larger monitoring effort of drug resistance throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend the application of repetitive genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from patients treated with antivirals to provide early insights into the evolution or antiviral resistance.",Alfredo Mari; Tim-Christoph Roloff; Madlen Stange; Kirstine Kobberoee Soegaard; Erblin Asllanaj; Gerardo Tauriello; Leila Tamara Alexander; Michael Schweitzer; Karoline Leuzinger; Alexander Gensch; Aurelien Martinez; Julia Bielicki; Hans Pargger; Martin Siegemund; Christian Nickel; Roland Bingisser; Michael Osthoff; Stefano Bassetti; Parham Sendi; Manuel Battegay; Catia Marzolini; Helena Seth-Smith; Torsten Schwede; Hans H.

367,Autoimmunity to the Lung Protective Phospholipid-Binding Protein Annexin A2 Predicts Mortality Among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundAnnexin A2 is a phospholipid-binding protein involved in fibrinolysis, cell membrane stabilization and repair, and ensuring the integrity of the pulmonary microvasculature. Given the autoantibodies observed in COVID-19 and that Annexin A2 is a known target of antiphospholipid antibodies, we studied autoimmunity directed against Annexin A2 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe used ELISA to identify the levels of IgG autoantibodies recognizing Annexin A2 and A5 among 86 hospitalized cases of COVID-19. Using logistic regression, we analyzed the association between anti-Annexin A2 and A5 antibody levels with mortality after adjusting for age, sex, race and key comorbidities.

ResultsWe found higher average levels of anti-Annexin A2 antibodies among hospitalized COVID-19 patients that died when compared with non-critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients (p-value = 0.006) and critically ill COVID-19 patients (p-value = 0.04). No significant differences in anti-Annexin A5 antibody levels were identified. Regression analysis showed that anti-Annexin A2 antibody levels as measured in relative units strongly predicted mortality with an odds ratio of 9.3 (95% CI: 1.9 to 44.6, p=0.005). In contrast, anti-Annexin A5 antibody levels were not associated with higher mortality (95% CI: 0.5 to 15.2, p=0.22).

ConclusionsWe determined that anti-Annexin A2 antibodies were elevated among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and these levels predicted mortality. It is known that inhibition of Annexin A2 induces systemic thrombosis, cell death, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Autoimmunity to Annexin A2 is a potential mechanism that may explain the key clinical findings of severe COVID-19.",Marisol Zuniga; Claudia Gomes; Steven E Carsons; Michael T Bender; Paolo Cotzia; Qing Robert Miao; David C Lee; Ana Rodriguez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248807,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248807,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
368,COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy worldwide: a systematic review of vaccine acceptance rates,"IntroductionUtility of vaccine campaigns to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not merely dependent on vaccine efficacy and safety. Vaccine acceptance among the general public and the healthcare workers, appears to have a decisive role for successful control of the pandemic.

AimTo provide an up-to-date assessment of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates worldwide.

MethodsA systematic search of the peer-reviewed English survey literature indexed in PubMed was done on December 25, 2020. Results from 30 studies, met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis for final COVID-19 vaccine acceptance estimates. Results of an additional recent survey from Jordan and Kuwait was considered in this review as well.

ResultsSurvey studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found from 33 different countries. Among adults representing the general public, the highest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China (91.3%). On the other hand, the lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%). Only eight surveys among healthcare workers (doctors, nurses) were found, with vaccine acceptance rates ranging from 27.7% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 78.1% in Israel. In a majority of survey studies among the general public (62%), the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination showed a level of [&ge;] 70%.

ConclusionsLow rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were reported in the Middle East, Russia, Africa and several European countries. This could represent a major problem in the global efforts that aim to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. More studies are recommended to address the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Such studies are particularly needed in the Middle East Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Middle and Latin America.

Based on GISAID data we have shown nearly exponential growth of the VUI-202012/01 to non-VUI-202012/01 genomes ratio in the five-week period since October 19 till November 22, 2020, with weekly growth rate of 2.31 [95% CI: 2.08-2.57]. Assuming the serial interval of 6.73 days we estimated the replicative advantage of VUI-202012/01 lineage as 2.316.73/7 = 2.24 [95% CI: 2.03-2.48].

371,Primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic - observations and challenges identified through a survey and interviews with community paediatricians: the calm before the storm,"BackgroundGlobally, the COVID-19 pandemic has a major impact on healthcare provision. The effects in primary care are understudied.

AimTo document changes in consultation numbers and patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify challenges for patient care.

MethodsSurvey of 44 paediatric primary care practices on consultation numbers and patient management changes (response rate 50%), and semi-structured interviews to identify challenges for patient care.

ResultsNumbers of consultations for scheduled developmental examinations remained unchanged compared to the previous year while emergency visits were strongly reduced (mean 87.3 less/week in March-May 2020 compared to 2019, median reduction 55.0%). Children dependent on developmental therapy and with chronic health conditions were identified as patient groups receiving deteriorated care. High patient numbers, including of mildly symptomatic children presenting for health certificates, in combination with increased organisational demands and expected staff outages are priority concerns for the winter.

ConclusionPrimary care paediatricians offered stable service through the early pandemic but expect strained resources for the upcoming winter. Unambiguous guidance on which children should present to primary care and who should be tested would help to allocate resources appropriately, and this guidance needs to consider age group specific issues including high prevalence of respiratory symptoms, dependency on carers and high contact rates.",Malte Kohns Vasconcelos; Katharina Weil; Daniela Vesterling-Hoerner; Mehrsad Klemm; Tarik el Scheich; Hanna Renk; Katharina Remke; Hans Martin Bosse,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249037,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249037,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True

A connection is made between the exposure dose and the probability of developing an airborne disease. This allows a simple assessment of the outdoor versus indoor risk of contamination to be made in a variety of meteorological situations. It is shown quantitatively that for most cases, the outdoor risk is orders of magnitude less than the indoor risk and that it can become comparable only for extremely specific meteorological and geographical situations. It sheds a light on various observations of Covid-19 spreading in mountain valleys with temperature inversions while at the same time other areas are much less impacted.

375,Reliability of Google Trends: Analysis of the Limits and Potential of Web Infoveillance During COVID-19 Pandemic and for Future Research,"BackgroundAlongside the COVID-19 pandemic, government authorities around the world have had to face a growing infodemic capable of causing serious damages to public health and economy. In this context, the use of infoveillance tools has become a primary necessity.

ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to test the reliability of a widely used infoveillance tool which is Google Trends. In particular, the paper focuses on the analysis of relative search volumes (RSVs) quantifying their dependence on the day they are collected.

MethodsRSVs of the query coronavirus + covid during February 1 - December 4, 2020 (period 1), and February 20 - May 18, 2020 (period 2), were collected daily by Google Trends from December 8 to 27, 2020. The survey covered Italian regions and cities, and countries and cities worldwide. The search category was set to all categories. Each dataset was analyzed to observe any dependencies of RSVs from the day they were gathered. To do this, by calling i the country, region, or city under investigation and j the day its RSV was collected, a Gaussian distribution [Formula] was used to represent the trend of daily variations of xij = RSVsij. When a missing value was revealed (anomaly), the affected country, region or city was excluded from the analysis. When the anomalies exceeded 20% of the sample size, the whole sample was excluded from the statistical analysis. Pearson and Spearman correlations between RSVs and the number of COVID-19 cases were calculated day by day thus to highlight any variations related to the day RSVs were collected. Student t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between the average RSVs of the various countries, regions, or cities of a given dataset. Two RSVs were considered statistical confident when t < 1.5. A dataset was deemed unreliable if the confident data exceeded 20% (confidence threshold). The percentage increase{Delta} was used to quantify the difference between two values.

ResultsGoogle Trends has been subject to an acceptable quantity of anomalies only as regards the RSVs of Italian regions (0% in both period 1 and period 2) and countries worldwide (9.7% during period 1 and 10.9% during period 2). However, the correlations between RSVs and COVID-19 cases underwent significant variations even in these two datasets (Max |{Delta}| = + 625% for Italian regions, and Max |{Delta}| = +175% for countries worldwide). Furthermore, only RSVs of countries worldwide did not exceed confidence threshold. Finally, the large amount of anomalies registered in Italian and international cities RSVs made these datasets unusable for any kind of statistical inference.

ConclusionsIn the considered timespans, Google Trends has proved to be reliable only for surveys concerning RSVs of countries worldwide. Since RSVs values showed a high dependence on the day they were gathered, it is essential for future research that the authors collect queries data for several consecutive days and work with their RSVs averages instead of daily RSVs, trying to minimize the standard errors until an established confidence threshold is respected.",Alessandro Rovetta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248969,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248969,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True

Method876 suspected COVID-19 patients and a subsample of 232 cases with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent brain CT/MRI scan (n=35) or only chest CT (n=197) in two radiology departments, were evaluated.

Results5.59% of all suspected COVID-19 patients found had brain scans and 98.74% chest CT. There was a statistically significant difference with associations regarding the COVID-19 brain scan group for: admission to ICU, greater severity of lung injuries, the use of mechanical ventilator, seizure, sepsis, and stroke and statistical tendency for chronic renal failure and systemic arterial hypertension. 40.0% of COVID-19 patients from the brain scan group were abnormal on brain CT and/or brain MRI. 22.9% cases with any kind of bleeding or microbleeding, 8.6% with restricted diffusion lesions. One ischemic stroke case was associated with irregularity at M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. There was a case of left facial nerve palsy with enhancement of left geniculate ganglia. An analyse of the olfactory bulbs was possible in 12 brain MRIs and 100% had enhancement and/or microbleeding. There was no statistical difference regarding death (9.1% versus 5.2%).

In conclusionthe COVID-19 patients group on which brain CT and/or MRI needed to be performed was statically associated with the more severe COVID-19 disease, an indication to ICU, a more severe form of lung disease, use of mechanical ventilator, seizure, sepsis and stroke. Less than half of patients had abnormal brain imaging scans with all of them showing vascular brain injury lesion, being more frequently microbleeding or bleeding, followed by restricted diffusion lesions.

377,Lived experiences of pregnant and new mothers during COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative analysis of YouTube birth stories.,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought on unprecedented changes, not only to our daily lives but also to our healthcare system. The pandemic has particularly impacted pregnant women that must give birth with tight restrictions and significant uncertainties. Birth stories have frequently been used as a way for women to describe their experiences with the birthing process. In this uncertain time, birth stories can provide valuable insight into how pregnancy and birth stressors during a pandemic can impact the patients overall experience. This study sought to describe and understand pregnant and new mothers lived experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsResearchers extracted relevant YouTube birth stories using predetermined search terms and inclusion criteria. The mothers birth stories were narrated in their second or third trimester or those who had recently given birth during the study period. Birth stories were analyzed using an inductive and deductive approach to capture different aspects of the birthing experience.

ResultsOverall, eighty-three birth stories were analyzed. Within these birth stories, four broad themes and twelve subthemes emerged. Key themes included a sense of loss, hospital experiences, experiences with healthcare providers, and unique experiences during birth and postpartum. The birth stories revealed negative and positive birth experiences. Particularly, mothers were frustrated with constantly changing policies within the healthcare setting that negatively affected their birthing experience. On the other hand, support from healthcare professionals, having their partners in the delivery room, and having a positive mindset was instrumental in having a positive birth experience.

ConclusionResults from this study provided a detailed description of womens lived experience with giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic.

378,An Intrinsic and Extrinsic Evaluation of Learned COVID-19 Concepts using Open-Source Word Embedding Sources,"IntroductionScientists are developing new computational methods and prediction models to better clinically understand COVID-19 prevalence, treatment efficacy, and patient outcomes. These efforts could be improved by leveraging documented, COVID-19-related symptoms, findings, and disorders from clinical text sources in the electronic health record. Word embeddings can identify terms related to these clinical concepts from both the biomedical and non-biomedical domains and are being shared with the open-source community at large. However, its unclear how useful openly-available word embeddings are for developing lexicons for COVID-19-related concepts.

ObjectiveGiven an initial lexicon of COVID-19-related terms, characterize the returned terms by similarity across various, open-source word embeddings and determine common semantic and syntactic patterns between the COVID-19 queried terms and returned terms specific to word embedding source.

Materials and MethodsWe compared 7 openly-available word embedding sources. Using a series of COVID-19-related terms for associated symptoms, findings, and disorders, we conducted an inter-annotator agreement study to determine how accurately the most semantically similar returned terms could be classified according to semantic types by three annotators. We conducted a qualitative study of COVID-19 queried terms and their returned terms to identify useful patterns for constructing lexicons. We demonstrated the utility of applying such terms to discharge summaries by reporting the proportion of patients identified by concept for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and COVID-19 cohorts.

ResultsWe observed high, pairwise inter-annotator agreement (Cohens Kappa) for symptoms (0.86 to 0.99), findings (0.93 to 0.99), and disorders (0.93 to 0.99). Word embedding sources generated based on characters tend to return more lexical variants and synonyms; in contrast, embeddings based on tokens more often return a variety of semantic types. Word embedding sources queried using an adjective phrase compared to a single term (e.g., dry cough vs. cough; muscle pain vs. pain) are more likely to return qualifiers of the same semantic type (e.g., ""dry"" returns consistency qualifiers like ""wet"", ""runny""). Terms for fever, cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia retrieved a higher proportion of patients than other clinical features.

379,Efficiency of Artificial Intelligence in Detecting COVID-19 Pneumonia and Other Pneumonia Causes by Quantum Fourier Transform Method,"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan in December 2019 and has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, this deadly pandemic has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to detect positive cases as early as possible to prevent the further spread of this outbreak. Currently, the most widely used COVID-19 detection technique is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RT-PCR is time-consuming to confirm infection in the patient. Because RT-PCR is less sensitive, it provides high false-negative results. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended as a solution to this problem by healthcare professionals because of its higher sensitivity for early and rapid diagnosis. In addition, radiation used in CT poses a serious threat to patients. In this study, we propose a CNN-based method to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other types of viral and bacterial pneumonia using low-dose CT images to reduce the radiation dose used in CT. In our study, we used a data set consisting of 7717 CT images of 350 patients that we collected from Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University Research Hospital. We used a CNN-based network that suppresses noise to remove interference from low-dose CT images. In the image preprocessing phase, we provided lung segmentation from CT images and applied quantum Fourier transform. By evaluating all possible variations of local knowledge at the same time with quantum Fourier transformation, the most informative spatial information was extracted. In CNN-based architecture, we used pre-trained ResNet50v2 as a feature extractor and fine-tune by training with our dataset. We visualized the efficiency of the ResNet50v2 network using the t-SNE method. We performed the classification process with a fully connected layer. We created a heat map using the GradCam technique to see where the model focuses on the images while classifying. In this experimental study, the results of 99.5%, 99.2%, 99.0%, 99.7%, and 99.1%, were obtained in the context of performance criteria such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and f1 score, respectively.

380,Evaluation of three rapid lateral flow antigen detection tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to high demand of diagnostic tools. Rapid antigen detection tests have been developed and many have received regulatory acceptance such as CE IVD or FDA markings. Their performance needs to be carefully assessed.

Materials and Methods158 positive and 40 negative retrospective samples collected in saline and analyzed by a laboratory-developed RT-PCR test were used to evaluate Sofia (Quidel), Standard Q (SD Biosensor), and Panbio (Abbott) rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs). A subset of the specimens was subjected to virus culture.

ResultsThe specificity of all RADTs was 100% and the sensitivity and percent agreement was 80% and 85% for Sofia, 81% and 85% for Standard Q, and 83% and 86% for Panbio, respectively. All three RADTs evaluated in this study reached a more than 90% sensitivity for samples with a high viral load as estimated from the low Ct values in the reference RT-PCR. Virus culture was successful in 80% of specimens with a Ct value <25.

ConclusionsAs expected, the RADTs were less sensitive than RT-PCR. However, they benefit from the speed and ease of testing, and lower price as compared to RT-PCR. Repeated testing in appropriate settings may improve the overall performance.",Anu E Jaaskelainen; Maarit J Ahava; Pia Jokela; Leonora Szirovicza; Sari Pohjala; Olli Vapalahti; Maija Lappalainen; Jussi Hepojoki; Satu Kurkela,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249057,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249057,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
381,Development of Electrospun Nanofibrous Filters for Controlling Coronavirus Aerosols,"Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a critical role in spreading COVID-19. To protect public health, we designed and fabricated electrospun nanofibrous air filters that hold promise for applications in personal protective equipment and indoor environment. Due to ultrafine nanofibers ([~]300 nm), the electrospun air filters had a much smaller pore size compared to the surgical mask and cloth masks (a couple of microns versus tens to hundreds of microns). A coronavirus strain was used to generate aerosols for filtration efficiency tests, which can better represent SARS-CoV-2 than other agents used for aerosol generation in previous studies. The electrospun air filters showed excellent performance by capturing up to 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols, which outperformed many commercial face masks. In addition, since NaCl aerosols have been widely used in filtration tests, we compared the filtration efficiency obtained from the coronavirus aerosols and the NaCl aerosols. The NaCl aerosols were demonstrated as an eligible surrogate for the coronavirus aerosols in the filtration tests, when air filters and face masks with diverse pore sizes, morphologies, and efficiencies were used. Our work paves a new avenue for advancing air filtration by developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission. Moreover, the removal efficiency of the NaCl aerosols can be reasonably translated into understanding how air filters capture the coronavirus aerosols.

382,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in England: Insights from linking epidemiological and genetic data,"The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, now designated Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC) by Public Health England, originated in the UK in late Summer to early Autumn 2020. We examine epidemiological evidence for this VOC having a transmission advantage from several perspectives. First, whole genome sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing provides an indication of changing prevalence of different genetic variants through time. Phylodynamic modelling additionally indicates that genetic diversity of this lineage has changed in a manner consistent with exponential growth. Second, we find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Third, we examine growth trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers at local area level across England, and show that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. Available SGTF data indicate a shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases.

Fourth, we assess the association of VOC frequency with independent estimates of the overall SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number through time. Finally, we fit a semi-mechanistic model directly to local VOC and non-VOC case incidence to estimate the reproduction numbers over time for each. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial transmission advantage, with the estimated difference in reproduction numbers between VOC and non-VOC ranging between 0.4 and 0.7, and the ratio of reproduction numbers varying between 1.4 and 1.8. We note that these estimates of transmission advantage apply to a period where high levels of social distancing were in place in England; extrapolation to other transmission contexts therefore requires caution.",Erik Volz; Swapnil Mishra; Meera Chand; Jeffrey C Barrett; Robert Johnson; Lily Geidelberg; Wes R Hinsley; Daniel J Laydon; Gavin Dabrera; Áine O'Toole; Roberto Amato; Manon Ragonnet-Cronin; Ian Harrison; Ben Jackson; Cristina V Ariani; Olivia Boyd; Nick Loman; John T McCrone; Sonia Gonçalves; David Jorgensen; Richard Myers; Verity Hill; David K Jackson; Katy Gaythorpe; Natalie Groves; John Sillitoe; Dominic P Kwiatkowski; - COG-UK; Seth Flaxman; Oliver Ratman; Samir Bhatt; Susan Hopkins; Axel Gandy; Andrew Rambaut; Neil M Ferguson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249034,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249034,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
383,Is sickle cell disease a risk factor for severe COVID-19 : a multicenter national retrospective cohort,"IntroductionCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is an infectious disease which has evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Growing evidence suggests that individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at higher risk of a more serious COVID-19 illness. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy which increases the susceptibility to infections and as a consequent has higher risks of morbidity and mortality.

The impact of COVID-19 on SCD patients could lead to further increase in disease severity and mortality. Studies that examine the effect of SCD on COVID-19 outcomes are lacking. This study aims to determine whether SCD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection in regards to the requirement of non-invasive ventilation/high flow nasal cannula (NIV/HFNC), mechanical intubation (MV) or death.

MethodsRetrospective cohort study which included COVID-19 patients admitted to four Ministry of Health COVID-19 treatment facilities in Bahrain during the period of 24, February 2020, to 31, July 2020. All SCD patients with COVID-19 were included and compared to randomly selected non-SCD patients with COVID-19. Data for the selected patients were collected from the medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to control for confounders and estimate the effect of SCD on the outcomes.

ResultsA total of 1,792 patients with COVID-19 were included; 38 of whom were diagnosed with SCD as well. In the SCD group, one (2.6%) patient required NIV/HFNC, one (2.6%) required MV and one (2.6%) death occurred. In comparison, 56 (3.2%) of the non-SCD patients required NIV/HFNC, 47 (2.7%) required MV and death occurred in 58 (3.3%) patients. Upon adjusting for confounders, SCD had an odds ratio of 1.847 (95% CI: 0.39 - 8.83; p=0.442).

384,Early measurement of blood sST2 is a good predictor of death and poor outcomes in patients admitted for COVID-19 infection,"ImportanceAlthough several biomarkers have shown correlation to prognosis in COVID-19 patients, their clinical value is limited because of lack of specificity, suboptimal sensibility, or poor dynamic behavior.

ObjectiveIn search of better prognostic markers in COVID-19, we hypothesized that circulating soluble ST2 (sST2) could be associated to a worse outcome, prompted by our previous knowledge of sST2 involvement in heart failure-associated lung deterioration, and by mounting evidence favoring a role of IL-33/ST2 axis in the disease.

Design, Setting and participantsOne hundred and fifty-two patients admitted for confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in a prospective non-interventional, observational study carried out in a tertiary teaching center. Blood samples were drawn at admission, 48-72 hours later and at discharge. sST2 concentrations, and routine blood laboratory were analyzed.

Main outcomesPrimary end-points were admission at intensive care unit (ICU) and, mortality. Other outcomes were a need for high oxygen flow therapy (HOF) or increasing treatment at 48/72 hours.

ResultsMedian age was 57.5 years (SD: 12.8), 60.4% males. Ten per cent of patients (n=15) were derived to ICU and/or died during admission. The rest stayed hospitalized 8(IQR:6) days on average. About 34% (n=47), 38% (n=53) and 48.5% (n=66) needed HOF, up-titrate therapy or both, respectively.

Median (IQR) sST2 serum concentration (ng/mL) rose to 53.1(30.9) at admission, peaked at 48-72h (79.5[64]) and returned to admission levels at discharge (44.9[36.7]), remaining significantly elevated above healthy donor values (18.6[15.1]).

A concentration of sST2 above 58.9 ng/mL identified patients progressing to ICU admission or death. These results remained significant after multivariable analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of sST2 for the occurrence of end-points was 0.776 (p=0.001). Admission sST2 was higher in patients who needed up-tritate therapy.

385,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the air from hospitals and closed rooms occupied by COVID-19 patients,"To understand air transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and risks for health care personnel and visitors to hospitals, we analyzed air samples collected from various enclosures in hospitals at Hyderabad and Mohali and performed closed room experiments with COVID-19 positive individuals. We collected 64 air samples from COVID and non-COVID areas of various hospitals and 17 samples from closed rooms occupied by COVID patients. 4 samples from COVID care areas were positive for SARS-CoV-2 with no obvious predilection towards ICU/non-ICU areas in the hospital samples. In the closed room experiments, where one or more COVID-19 patients spent a short duration of time, one sample - collected immediately after the departure of three symptomatic patients from the room - was positive. Our results indicate that the chance of picking up SARS-CoV-2 in the air is directly related to a number of COVID positive cases in the room, their symptomatic status, and the duration of exposure and that the demarcation of hospital areas into COVID and non-COVID areas is a successful strategy to prevent cross infections. In neutral environmental conditions, the virus does not seem to spread farther away from the patients, especially if they are asymptomatic, giving an objective evidence for the effectiveness of physical distancing in curbing the spread of the epidemic.",Shivranjani Moharir; Sharat Sharath Chandra; Arushi Goel; Bhuwaneshwar Thakur; Gurpreet Singh Bhalla; Dinesh Kumar; Digvijay Singh Naruka; Ashwani Kumar; Amit Tuli; Swathi Suravaram; Thrilok Chander Bingi; M Srinivas; Rajarao Mesipogu; Krishna Reddy; Sanjeev Khosla; Karthik Bharadwaj Tallapaka; Rakesh K Mishra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248890,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248890,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
386,"Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19: a prompt, feasible, and sensitive diagnostic tool for COVID-19 based on a 1,757-patient cohort (The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis).","ImportanceIn the COVID-19 pandemic, a limiting barrier for more successful approaches to COVID-19 is the lack of appropriate timing for its diagnosis, during the viral replication stage, when antiviral approaches could demonstrate efficacy, precluding progression to severe stages. Three major reasons that hamper the diagnosis earlier in the disease are the unspecific and mild symptoms in the first stage, the cost- and time-limitations of the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, and the insufficient sensitivity of this test as desired for screening purposes during the pandemic. More sensitive and earlier methods of COVID-19 detection should be considered as key for breakthrough changes in the disease course and response to specific therapeutic strategies. Our objective was to propose a clinical scoring for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis) that has been validated in a large population sample, aiming to encourage the management of patients with high pre-clinical likelihood of presenting COVID-19, at least during the pandemics, independent of a rtPCR-SARS-COV-2 test.

Materials and methodsThis is a compounded retrospective and prospective analysis of clinical data prospectively collected from the Pre-AndroCoV and AndroCov Trials that resulted in a clinical scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis based on likelihood of presenting COVID-19 according to the number of symptoms, presence of anosmia, and known positive household contact, in a variety of combinations of scoring criteria, aiming to the detect scorings that provided the highest pre-test probability and accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and accuracy were calculated for subjects screened in two different periods and altogether, for females, males, and both, in a total of nine different scenarios, for combinations between one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia in subjects without known positive household contacts, and no symptoms, one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia or ageusia in subjects with known positive household contacts.

Results1,757 patients were screened for COVID-19. Among the multiple combinations, requiring two or more symptoms with or without anosmia or ageusia for subjects without known contact and one or more symptoms with or without anosmia or ageusia with known positive contacts presented the highest accuracy (80.4%), and higher pretest probability and accuracy than virtually all rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 commercially available kit tests.

ConclusionThe AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis was demonstrated to be a feasible, quick, inexpensive and sensitive diagnostic tool for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. A clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 should avoid delays and missed diagnosis, and reduce costs, and should therefore be recommended as a first-line option for COVID-19 diagnosis for public health policies, at least while SARS-CoV-2 is the prevailing circulating virus.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 sensitive, accurate, and feasible?

FindingsThe present analysis of a 1,757-subject cohort of the AndroCoV trials demonstrated that clinical scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis can deliver a more sensitive and prompter diagnosis than the current gold-standard diagnostic method, rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, with an accuracy above 80%.

MeaningA clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 avoids missed diagnosis due to insufficient sensitivity or incorrect timing of the performance of rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, reduces costs, avoid delays on specific managements, and allows the testing of potentially effective antiviral therapeutic approaches that should work if administered in the early stage of COVID-19",Flavio A Cadegiani; John A McCoy; Carlos Gustavo Wambier; Andy Goren,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248803,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248803,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
387,PREDICTORS OF UPTAKE OF A POTENTIAL COVID-19 VACCINE AMONG NIGERIAN ADULTS,"BackgroundThe Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) pandemic is not abating and there is no approved treatment yet. The development of vaccines is hoped to help in addressing this disease outbreak. However, in the face of anti-vaccines uprise, it is important to understand the factors that may influence the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines as this will influence how successful the fight against COVID-19 will be in the long term.

MethodsA cross-sectional study among 776 adult Nigerians (age [&ge;]18 years) was conducted in the 36 States of Nigeria and the Capital City with online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 5 sections: socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, respondents knowledge of COVID-19, respondents risk perception of COVID-19, vaccination history of respondents, and willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Descriptive analysis of variables was done and multivariate analysis using logistic regression was carried out to determine the predictors of uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The level of significance was predetermined at a p-value < 0.05. Data analysis was done with SPSS version 21.

ResultsMost of the respondents were male (58.1%). Most participants were willing to take a potential COVID-19 vaccine (58.2%), while 19.2% would not take it with 22.6% indecisive. 53.5% would prefer a single dose COVID-19 vaccine. For vaccine uptake, being male (p= 0.002) and the perception that ""vaccines are good"" (p< 0.001) were the positive predictor of uptake of a potential COVID-19 vaccine.

388,Insights into the molecular mechanism of anticancer drug ruxolitinib repurposable in COVID-19 therapy,"Due to non-availability of specific therapeutics against COVID-19, repurposing of approved drugs is a reasonable option. Cytokines imbalance in COVID-19 resembles cancer; exploration of anti-inflammatory agents, might reduce COVID-19 mortality. The current study investigates the effect of ruxolitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected alveolar cells compared to the uninfected one from the GSE5147507 dataset. The protein-protein interaction network, biological process and functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes were studied using STRING App of the Cytoscape software and R programming tools. The present study indicated that ruxolitinib treatment elicited similar response equivalent to that of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected situation by inducing defense response in host against virus infection by RLR and NOD like receptor pathways. Further, the effect of ruxolitinib in SARS-CoV-2 infection was mainly caused by significant suppression of IFIH1, IRF7 and MX1 genes as well as inhibition of DDX58/IFIH1-mediated induction of interferon-I and -II signalling.",Manisha Mandal; Shyamapada Mandal,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248986,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248986,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
389,Imprecise assessment of mask use may obscure associations with SARS-CoV-2 positivity,"Masks are effective measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, however, lack of a national mandate coupled with poor adherence has led to suboptimal levels of transmission reduction. Although data has suggested that mask adherence is high, few studies have captured details on how mask wearing changes with activities and how these behaviors are associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We recruited an online sample of 3,058 respondents from three US states (MD, FL, IL; n[~]1000/state) between September 16 - October 15, 2020. The median age of the sample was 47; 53% were female, 56% were white and 22% were working outside the home. Seventy three percent of the sample reported always wearing a mask indoors and outdoors based on local guidelines, however, 78% of participants who reported always wearing a mask reported taking their mask off when outside the home. While overall masking according to guidelines was not significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, sometimes, often or always removing a mask during activities were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (adjusted odds ratio for always vs never removing mask: 9.92; 95% CI: 1.16 - 85.1). These findings suggest that masks were most effective when worn without removal reflecting the need for consistent use.",Sophie Berube; Steven Clipman; Shruti H Mehta; Sunil Solomon; Amy Wesolowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249033,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249033,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
390,COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency Department (COPE),"Background and aimThe COVID-19 pandemic is putting extraordinary pressure on emergency departments (EDs). To support decision making about hospital admission, we aimed to develop a simple and valid model for predicting mortality and need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) in suspected-COVID-19 patients presenting at the ED.

MethodsFor model development, we included patients that presented at the ED and were admitted to 4 large Dutch hospitals with suspected COVID-19 between March and August 2020, the first wave of the pandemic in the Netherlands. Based on prior literature we included patient characteristics, vital parameters and blood test values, all measured at ED admission, as potential predictors. Logistic regression analyses with post-hoc uniform shrinkage was used to obtain predicted probabilities of in-hospital death and of being admitted to the ICU, both within 28 days after admission. Model performance (AUC; calibration plots, intercepts and slopes) was assessed with temporal validation in patients who presented between September and December 2020 (second wave). We used multiple imputation to account for missing predictor values.

ResultsThe development data included 5,831 patients who presented at the ED and were hospitalized, of whom 629 (10.8%) died and 5,070 (86.9%) were discharged within 28 days after admission. A simple model - named COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency Department (COPE) - with linear age and logarithmic transforms of respiratory rate, CRP, LDH, albumin and urea captured most of the ability to predict death within 28 days. Patients who were admitted in the first month of the pandemic had substantially increased risk of death (odds ratio 1.99; 95% CI 1.61-2.47). COPE was well-calibrated and showed good discrimination for predicting death in 3,252 patients of the second wave (AUC in 4 hospitals: 0.82; 0.82; 0.79; 0.83). COPE was also able to identify patients at high risk of needing IC in second wave patients below the age of 70 (AUC 0.84; 0.81), but overestimated ICU admission for low-risk patients. The models are implemented as a web-based application.

ConclusionCOPE is a simple tool that is well able to predict mortality and ICU admission for patients who present to the ED with suspected COVID-19 and may help to inform patients and doctors when deciding on hospital admission.",David van Klaveren; Alexandros Rekkas; Jelmer Alsma; Rob JCG Verdonschot; Dick TJJ Koning; Marlijn JA Kamps; Tom Dormans; Robert Stassen; Sebastiaan Weijer; Klaas-Sierk Arnold; Marieke Roelink; Stephanie CE Schuit; Hester Lingsma,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249023,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249023,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
391,Percentage of reported Covid-19 cases in Colombia: Estimating the true scale of the pandemic,"Since March 6, when Colombia confirmed its first case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the country healthcare system, with a limited testing capability, has struggled to monitor and report current cases. At the outbreak of a virus, data on cases is sparse and commonly severe cases, with a higher probability of a fatal resolution, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases. In addition, in an under-sampling situation, the number of total cases is under-estimated leading to a biased case fatality rate estimation, most likely inflating the virus mortality. Real time estimation of case fatality ratio can also be biased downwards by overlooking the delay between symptoms onset to death. In this communication, using reported data from Instituto Nacional de Salud up to December 28, we estimate the case fatality rate for Covid-19 in Colombia and some of its regions and cities adjusting for delay from onset to death. We then apply the method proposed by Russell et al. [1], and use our corrected case fatality rate to estimate the percentage of Covid-19 cases reported in Colombia as 42.95% (95% confidence interval: 42.50-43.41), which corresponds to a total of 3661,621 estimated Covid-19 cases in the country.",Nicolás Parra; Vladimir Vargas-Calderón; Juan Sebastián Flórez; Leonel Ardila; Carlos Viviescas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249052,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249052,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True

The vaccine is characterized by its coverage, induced temporal immunity and efficacy. The population dynamics of both diseases considers infected individuals of each disease and hosts that are susceptible to one but have recovered from the other. We do not incorporate coinfection. We postulate two main transmission factors affecting the effective contact rates: i) that the virus with higher reproduction number can superinfect the one with lower reproduction number and ii) that there is some protection induced by vaccination against the weaker virus that reduces the probability of infection by the stronger virus. Our results indicate that coexistence of the viruses is possible in the long term. The time-dependent effective contact rate may induce either alternating outbreaks of each disease or synchronous outbreaks. We also found the existence of bi-stability triggered by a backward bifurcation, conducive to scenarios where, at the population level, vaccine application may promote persistence of both diseases provided the effective coverage and vaccine efficacy are low.",Manuel Adrian Acuna Zegarra; Mayra Nunez Lopez; Mario Santana Cibrian; Andreu Comas Garcia; Jorge X.

393,Cardiometabolic risks of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization using Mendelian Randomization,"IntroMany cardiometabolic conditions have demonstrated associative evidence with COVID-19 hospitalization risk. However, the observational designs of the studies in which these associations are observed preclude causal inferences of hospitalization risk. Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an alternative risk estimation method more robust to these limitations that allows for causal inferences.

Methods & materialsWe applied four MR methods (MRMix, IMRP, IVW, MREgger) to publicly available GWAS summary statistics from European (COVID-19 GWAS n=2,956) and multi-ethnic populations (COVID-19 GWAS n=10,808) to better understand extant causal associations between Type II Diabetes (GWAS n=659,316), BMI (n=681,275), diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure (n=757,601 for each) and COVID-19 hospitalization risk across populations.

ResultsAlthough no significant causal effect evidence was observed, our data suggested a trend of increasing hospitalization risk for Type II diabetes (IMRP OR, 95% CI: 1.67, 0.96-2.92) and pulse pressure (OR, 95% CI: 1.27, 0.97-1.66) in the multi-ethnic sample.

ConclusionsType II diabetes and Pulse pressure demonstrates a potential causal association with COVID-19 hospitalization risk, the proper treatment of which may work to reduce the risk of a severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization. However, GWAS of COVID-19 with large sample size is warranted to confirm the causality.",Noah J Lorincz-Comi; Xiaofeng Zhu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248889,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248889,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
394,Lockdown Effects on Sars-CoV-2 Transmission - The evidence from Northern Jutland,"The exact impact of lockdowns and other NPIs on Sars-CoV-2 transmission remain a matter of debate as early models assumed 100% susceptible homogenously transmitting populations, an assumption known to overestimate counterfactual transmission, and since most real epidemiological data are subject to massive confounding variables. Here, we analyse the unique case-controlled epidemiological dataset arising from the selective lockdown of parts of Northern Denmark, but not others, as a consequence of the spread of mink-related mutations in November 2020. Our analysis shows that while infection levels decreased, they did so before lockdown was effective, and infection numbers also decreased in neighbour municipalities without mandates. Direct spill-over to neighbour municipalities or the simultaneous mass testing do not explain this. Instead, control of infection pockets possibly together with voluntary social behaviour was apparently effective before the mandate, explaining why the infection decline occurred before and in both the mandated and non-mandated areas. The data suggest that efficient infection surveillance and voluntary compliance make full lockdowns unnecessary at least in some circumstances.",Kasper Planeta Kepp; Christian Bjornskov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248936,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248936,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
395,Unsupervised Discovery of Risk Profiles on Negative and Positive COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients,"COVID-19 is a viral disease that affects people in different ways: Most people will develop mild symptoms; others will require hospitalization, and a few others will die. Hence identifying risk factors is vital to assist physicians in the treatment decision. The objective of this paper is to determine whether unsupervised analysis of risk factors of positive and negative COVID-19 subjects may be useful for the discovery of a small set of reliable and clinically relevant risk-profiles. We selected 13367 positive and 19958 negative hospitalized patients from the Mexican Open Registry. Registry patients were described by 13 risk factors, three different outcomes, and COVID-19 test results. Hence, the dataset could be described by 6144 different risk-profiles per age group. To discover the most common risk-profiles, we propose the use of unsupervised learning. The data was split into discovery (70%) and validation (30%) sets. The discovery set was analyzed using the partition around medoids (PAM) method and robust consensus clustering was used to estimate the stable set of risk-profiles. We validated the reliability of the PAM models by predicting the risk-profile of the validation set subjects. The clinical relevance of the risk-profiles was evaluated on the validation set by characterizing the prevalence of the three patient outcomes: pneumonia diagnosis, ICU, or death. The analysis discovered six positives and five negative COVID-19 risk-profiles with strong statistical differences among them. Henceforth PAM clustering with consensus mapping is a viable method for unsupervised risk-profile discovery among subjects with critical respiratory health issues.",Fahimeh Nezhadmoghadam; Jose Tamez-Pena,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248908,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248908,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
396,Identical trends of SARS-Cov-2 transmission and retail and transit mobility during non-lockdown periods,"Recent literature strongly supports the idea that mobility reduction and social distancing play a crucial role in transmission of SARS-Cov-2 infections. It was shown during the first wave that mobility restrictions reduce significantly infection transmission. Here we document the reverse relationship by showing, between the first two Covid-19 waves, a high positive correlation between the trends of SARS-Cov-2 transmission and mobility. These two trends oscillate simultaneously and increased mobility following lockdown relaxation has a significant positive relationship with increased transmission. From a public health perspective, these results highlight the importance of following the evolution of mobility when relaxing mitigation measures to anticipate the future evolution of the spread of the SARS-Cov-2.",Bernard Cazelles; Catherine Comiskey; Benjamin Nguyen Van Yen; Clara Champagne; Benjamin Roche,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248990,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248990,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
397,The Silent Pandemic COVID -19 in the Asymptomatic Population,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world there is a great need to understand the dynamics of spread. Currently the seroprevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 doubles every 3 months, this silent epidemic of new infections may be the main driving force behind the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Public health official quickly recognized that clinical cases were just the tip of the iceberg. In fact a great deal of the spread was being driven by the asymptomatically infected who continued to go out, socialize and go to work. While seropositivity is an insensitive marker for acute infection it does tell us about the prevalence COVID-19 in the population.

ObjectiveDescribe the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States over time.

MethodologyRepeated convenience samples from a commercial laboratory dedicated to the assessment of life insurance applicants were tested for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, in several time periods between May and December of 2020. US census data were used to estimate the population prevalence of seropositivity.

ResultsThe raw seroprevalence in the May-June, September, and December timeframes were 3.0%, 6.6% and 10.4%, respectively. Higher rates were noted in younger vs. older age groups. Total estimated seroprevalence in the US is estimated at 25.7 million cases.

398,Characterizing Two Outbreak Waves of COVID-19 in Spain Using Phenomenological Epidemic Modelling,"Since the first case reported of SARS-CoV-2 the end of December 2019 in China, the number of cases quickly climbed following an exponential growth trend, demonstrating that a global pandemic is possible. As of December 3, 2020, the total number of cases reported are around 65,527,000 contagions worldwide, and 1,524,000 deaths affecting 218 countries and territories. In this scenario, Spain is one of the countries that has suffered in a hard way, the ongoing epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, namely COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we present the utilization of phenomenological epidemic models to characterize the two first outbreak waves of COVID-19 in Spain. The study is driven using a two-step phenomenological epidemic approach. First, we use a simple generalized growth model to fit the main parameters at the early epidemic phase; later, we apply our previous finding over a logistic growth model to that characterize both waves completely. The results show that even in the absence of accurate data series, it is possible to characterize the curves of case incidence, and even construct short-term forecast in the near time horizon.",Miguel Lopez; Alberto Peinado; Andres Ortiz,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20247833,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20247833,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
399,Antemortem vs. postmortem histopathological and ultrastructural findings in paired transbronchial biopsies and lung autopsy samples from three patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major cause of death in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Multiple autopsy-based reports of COVID-19 lung pathology describe diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), organizing pneumonia (OP) and fibrotic change, but data on early pathological changes as well as during progression of the disease are rare.

Research questionComparison of histopathological and ultrastructural findings in paired transbronchial biopsies (TBBs) and autopsy material from three patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection.

MethodsWe prospectively enrolled 3 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Full clinical evaluation was performed including high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT). We took TBBs at different time points during the disease and autopsy tissue samples after the patients death.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR and/or FISH in all TBBs. Lung histology revealed pneumocyte hyperplasia and capillary congestion in one patient who died short after hospital admission with detectable virus in 1/2 autopsy samples from the lung. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 2/2 autopsy samples from a patient with a fulminant course of the disease and very short latency between biopsy and autopsy, both showing widespread DAD. In a third patient with a prolonged course, i.e. five weeks of ICU treatment with ECMO, autopsy samples showed extensive interstitial fibrosis without detectable virus by RT-PCR and/or FISH.

InterpretationWe report the course of COVID-19 in paired TBB and autopsy samples from three patients at an early stage, in rapidly progressive and in a prolonged disease course. Our findings illustrate vascular, organizing and fibrotic patterns of COVID-19-induced lung injury and suggest an early spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the upper airways to the lung periphery with diminishing viral load during disease.",Daniel Gagiannis; Vincent G Umathum; Wilhelm Bloch; Conn Rother; Marcel Stahl; Hanno M Witte; Sonja Djudjaj; Peter Boor; Konrad Steinestel,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248929,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248929,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True

AimTo describe clinical, laboratorial and treatment of confirmed COVID-19 pediatric admitted in hospitals.

MethodsA retrospective study was conducted in children (0-18 years), admitted between March and November 15, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or serological tests. Clinical data about symptoms, laboratorial exams and treatments were analysed. Patients were evaluated according predominant (PRS) or non-predominant respiratory symptoms (non-PRS)

ResultsSixty-four patients were evaluated, being the median age 5.6 years. Forty-seven (73.4%) children were admitted with PRS and 17 (26.4%) with non-PRS. The main symptoms in the PRS group were fever in 74.5% of children and cough in 66%; and fever in 76.5% and edema/cavitary effusion in 29.4% in the non-PRS group. The median of C-reactive protein (in mg/dl) was 2.5 in the PRS group and 6.1 in the non-PRS group. Antibiotics were used in 85.1% of the PRS group and 94.1% of non-group. Comorbidity was present in 30/47 (63.8%) of PRS group and 8/17 (47.1%) of non-PRS group (p=0.22). Length of stay until 7 days in patients with comorbidity was present in 27/64 (42.1%) and more than 7 days in 11/64 (17.1%) (p= 0.2)

ConclusionNon-PRS represented more than one quarter of admitted patients. Fever was the main symptom detected, elevated CRP was frequent and antibiotics were commonly prescribed.

401,Strategies to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in classroom settings: Combined impacts of ventilation and mask effective filtration efficiency,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be significant and global. As the global community learns more about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is strong evidence that a significant modality of transmission is via the long-range airborne route, referred to here as aerosol transmission. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of ventilation, mask effective filtration efficiency, and the combined effect of the two on the reduction of aerosol infection probability for COVID-19 in a classroom setting. The Wells-Riley equation is used to predict the conditional probability of infection for three distinct airborne exposure scenarios: (1) an infectious instructor exposing susceptible students; (2) an infectious student exposing other susceptible students; and (3) an infectious student exposing a susceptible instructor. Field measurements were performed in a classroom using a polydisperse neutralized salt (NaCl) aerosol, generated in a size range consistent with human-generated SARS-CoV-2 containing bioaerosols, as a safe surrogate. Measurements included time-resolved and size-resolved NaCl aerosol concentration distributions and size-resolved effective filtration efficiency of different masks with and without mask fitters. The measurements were used to validate assumptions and inputs for the Wells-Riley model. Aerosol dynamics and distribution measurements confirmed that the majority of the classroom space is uniform in aerosol concentration within a factor of 2 or better for distances > 2 m from the aerosol source. Mask effective filtration efficiency measurements show that most masks fit poorly with estimated leakage rates typically > 50%, resulting in significantly reduced effective filtration efficiency. However, effective filtration efficiencies approaching the mask material filtration efficiency were achievable using simple mask fitters. Wells-Riley model results for the different scenarios suggest that ventilation of the classroom alone is not able to achieve infection probabilities less than 0.01 (1%) for air exchanges rates up to 10 h-1 and an event duration of one hour. The use of moderate to high effective filtration efficiency masks by all individuals present, on the other hand, was able to significantly reduce infection probability and could achieve reductions in infection probability by 5x, 10x, or even >100x dependent on the mask used and use of a mask fitter. This enables conditional infection probabilities < 0.001 (0.1%) or even < 0.0001 (0.01%) to be reached with the use of masks and mask fitters alone. Finally, the results demonstrate that the reductions provided by ventilation and masks are synergistic and multiplicative. The results reinforce the use of properly donned masks to achieve reduced aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases transmitted via respiratory aerosol indoors and provide new motivation to further improve the effective filtration efficiency of common face coverings through improved design, and/or the use of mask fitters.",David A Rothamer; Scott T Sanders; Douglas Reindl; Timothy H Bertram,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249101,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249101,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True

In the present study, we shared our experiences on telerehabilitation services established primarily for students with visual disabilities (SwVD) amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its outputs.

MethodsFollowing the lockdown declared on March 23, 2020, the rehabilitative team of a tertiary eye center in north India received information that many VCS were stranded in schools for the blind in Delhi, and feeling with anxiety and panic in absence of teachers. Shortly, the room for vision rehabilitation clinic was set-up for tele-facilities. The intended services was explained while disseminating the mobile numbers. A semi-structured questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended was developed to record COVID-19 knowledge and concerns. Inductive content analysis was used to report the qualitative information.

ResultsAs of June 30, 2020, a total of 492 clients contacted the team, with maximum from Delhi (41.5%), and predominantly males (78.8%). Around 80.3% of callers were VCS with age range of 11 to 30 years. The two most frequently encountered health needs were itching in eyes (36.1%) and headache (29%). Television news was the most used medium among callers to get COVID-19 information. Cough is a less frequently known mode of transmission (28%), similarly handwashing as a less known for prevention (17.2%). Eight concerns were recorded based on qualitative data analysis.

The novelty of the methodology is based on the computation of the affinity between the lesion masks features extracted from the image. First, a batch of vectorized lesion masks is constructed. Then, the model learns the parameters of the affinity matrix that captures the relationship between features in each vector. Finally, the affinity is expressed as a single vector of pre-defined length. Without any complicated data manipulation, class balancing tricks, and using only a fraction of the training data, we achieve a 91.74% COVID-19 sensitivity, 85.35% common pneumonia sensitivity, 97.26% true negative rate and 91.94% F1-score.

404,Effect of public health interventions during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Cyprus: a modelling study,"BackgroundCyprus addressed the first wave of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. The aims of this study were: a) to estimate epidemiological parameters of this wave including infection attack ratio, infection fatality ratio, and case ascertainment ratio, b) to assess the impact of public health interventions, and c) to examine what would have happened if those interventions had not been implemented.

MethodsA dynamic, stochastic, individual-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model was developed to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression in the population of the Republic of Cyprus. The model was fitted to the observed trends in COVID-19 deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) bed use.

ResultsBy May 8 2020th, the infection attack ratio was 0.31% (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 0.15%, 0.54%), the infection fatality ratio was 0.71% (95% CrI: 0.44%, 1.61%), and the case ascertainment ratio was 33.2% (95% CrI: 19.7%, 68.7%). If Cyprus had not implemented any public health measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 14th. The interventions averted 715 (95% CrI: 339, 1235) deaths. If Cyprus had only increased ICU beds, without any social distancing measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 19th.

The Panbio is United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals within the first 7 days of COVID-19 symptom onset(s).

METHODSSymptomatic adults recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the community were recruited into the study. Paired nasopharyngeal (NP), throat, and saliva swabs were collected, with one paired swab tested immediately with the Panbio, and the other transported in universal transport media and tested using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated. Subsequently, individuals within 7 days of symptom onset who presented to community assessment centres for SARS-CoV-2 testing had Panbio testing completed and paired with RT-PCR results from parallel NP or throat swabs.

RESULTS145 individuals were included in the study. Collection of throat and saliva was stopped early due to poor performance (throat PPA 57.7%, n=61, and saliva PPA 2.6%, n=41). NP swab PPA was 87.7% [n=145, 95% confidence interval 81.0% - 92.7%]. There were 1,641 symptomatic individuals tested by Panbio in community assessment centres, with 268/1641 (16.3%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. There were 37 false negatives, corresponding to a PPA of 86.2% [81.5% - 90.1%].

406,"Implications in the quantitation of SARS-CoV2 copies in concurrent nasopharyngeal swabs, whole mouth fluid and respiratory droplets","ImportanceThe nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) is considered the ideal diagnostic specimen for Covid-19, while WMF is recently promoted due to collection simplicity and importance in disease transmission. There is limited knowledge on the relative viral load in these samples - NPS, whole mouth fluid (WMF) and respiratory droplets (RD; another important source in transmission), on how the loads vary with disease severity and on how much virus is shed.

ObjectiveTo quantify and compare SARS-CoV2 copies in the NPS, WMF and RD samples, and correlate with disease severity.

DesignCross sectional study.

SettingTertiary care multi-speciality hospital with limited resources in a low-to-middle income country.

ParticipantsEighty suspected COVID-19 patients were recruited from the COVID-19 out-patient clinic and hospital isolation wards.

InterventionConcurrent NPS, WMF and RD samples were collected from all the recruited patients and tested for SARS-CoV2 copies by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Main outcomes and measuresThe main outcome was COVID-19 measured by SARS-CoV2 quantitative RT-PCR in NPS samples. COVID-19 disease severity was determined according to NIH criteria. Virus shedding was defined as the presence of SARS-CoV2 copies in the WMF and RD samples.

ResultsSARS-CoV2 was detected in 55/80 (69%) of the NPS samples. Of these 55, WMF and RD samples were positive in 44 (80%) and 17 (31%), respectively. The concordance of WMF with NPS was 84% (p=0.02). SARS-CoV2 copy numbers were comparable in the NPS (median: 8.74x10^5) and WMF (median: 3.07x10^4), but lower in RD samples (median: 3.60x10^2). Patients with mild disease had higher copies in the NPS (median: 3.46x10^6), while patients with severe disease had higher copies in the WMF (median: 1.34x10^6) and RD samples (median: 4.29x10^4). The 25-75% interquartile range of NPS SARS-CoV2 copies was significantly higher in the WMF (p=0.0001) and RD (p=0.01) positive patients.

Conclusion and relevanceSARS-CoV2 copies are highest in NPS samples. WMF is a reliable surrogate sample for diagnosis. High copy numbers in the NPS imply initial virological phase and higher risk of virus shedding via WMF and RD.

408,"The Joint Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on Infections, Hospitalizations, and Mortality: An Agent-Based Simulation","BackgroundVaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to significantly reduce transmission and morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. This modeling study simulated the comparative and joint impact of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage with and without non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on total infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.

MethodsAn agent-based simulation model was employed to estimate incident SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths over 18 months for the State of North Carolina, a population of roughly 10.5 million. Vaccine efficacy of 50% and 90% and vaccine coverage of 25%, 50%, and 75% (at the end of a 6-month distribution period) were evaluated. Six vaccination scenarios were simulated with NPIs (i.e., reduced mobility, school closings, face mask usage) maintained and removed during the period of vaccine distribution.

ResultsIn the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy and 25% coverage), 2,231,134 new SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred with NPIs removed and 799,949 infections with NPIs maintained. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy and 75% coverage), there were 450,575 new infections with NPIs maintained and 527,409 with NPIs removed. When NPIs were removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared to the worst-case scenario (absolute risk reduction 13% and 8%, respectively).

ConclusionSimulation results suggest that premature lifting of NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. Our findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many pre-pandemic activities can be resumed.",Mehul D Patel; Erik Rosenstrom; Julie S Ivy; Maria E Mayorga; Pinar Keskinocak; Ross M Boyce; Kristen Hassmiller Lich; Raymond L Smith; Karl T Johnson; Julie L Swann,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248888,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20248888,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
409,"THE INFLUENCE OF HLA GENOTYPE ON SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, AND SEVERITY OF, COVID-19 INFECTION","BackgroundThe impact of COVID-19 varies markedly, not only between individual patients but also between different populations. We hypothesised that differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes might influence this variation.

MethodsUsing next generation sequencing, we analysed the class I and class II classical HLA genes of 147 white British patients with variable clinical outcomes. 49 of these patients were admitted to hospital with severe COVID infection. They had no significant pre-existing comorbidities. We compared the results to those obtained from a group of 69 asymptomatic hospital workers who evidence of COVID exposure based on blood antibody testing. Allelic frequencies in both the severe and asymptomatic groups were compared to local and national healthy controls with adjustments made for age and sex. With the inclusion of hospital staff who had reported localised symptoms only (limited to loss of smell/taste, n=13) or systemic symptoms not requiring hospital treatment (n=16), we carried out ordinal logistic regression modelling to determine the relative influence of age, BMI, sex and the presence of specific HLA genes on symptomatology.

FindingsWe found a significant difference in the allelic frequency of HLA-DRB1*04:01 in the severe patient compared to the asymptomatic staff group (5.1% versus 16.7%, p=0.003 after adjustment for age and sex). There was a significantly lower frequency of the haplotype DQA1*01:01/DQB1*05:01/DRB1*01:01 in the asymptomatic group compared to the background population (p=0.007). Ordinal logistic regression modelling confirmed the significant influence of DRB1*04:01 on the clinical severity of COVID-19 observed in the cohorts.

InterpretationThis study provides evidence that patient age, sex, BMI and HLA genotype interact to determine the clinical outcome of COVID-19 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSHLA genes are implicated in host resistance or susceptibility to a range of pathogens. No studies thus far have compared HLA allele frequencies in patients requiring hospital admission following COVID-19 exposure to a group of asymptomatic individuals.

Added value of this studyThe results indicate that the presence of HLA-DRB1*04:01 might confer protection from the development of respiratory failure following exposure to COVID. Individuals remaining asymptomatic following exposure to COVID are less likely to carry the haplotype DQA1*01:01/DQB1*05:01/DRB1*01:01 compared to the background population. This may indicate a host defence pathway not primarily dependent on an IgG response for clearance of infection. These findings conflict with larger genome wide association studies which compared HLA allelic frequencies of severely unwell patients with the background population.

410,Analysis of the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic in Berlin towards an universal prognostic relationship,"The present work is a continuation and development of research on prediction and analysis of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.

The proposed model adequately describes the development of the coronavirus epidemic with insufficient adherence to quarantine and social distancing. The transition from the absolute number of infected persons to their relative number per inhabitant of a settlement makes it possible to obtain universal calculation ratios.

In performing the calculations, the choice of the date of the beginning of the epidemic is of great importance. Recommendations are given on how to determine the date of the beginning of the epidemic based on the analysis of statistical data on the spread of the epidemic. The coefficient of virus transmission rate k included in the calculated prognostic relation depends on the population size and the type of virus strain in the settlement in question. A simple ratio for calculating this coefficient as a function of population size is proposed.

Control calculations performed using only a single empirical coefficient showed high accuracy. The calculated curves for Germany, Berlin, and its districts agree well with the corresponding statistical data. The correlation coefficients between the corresponding curves reach values of 0.93 to 0.97. The further development of the model should thus go in the direction of identifying causal links between the intensity of the epidemic and the main factors affecting this process. Some of these factors are related to the characteristics of the populations behaviour and the infrastructure of cities. The increase in the incidence in areas with a large percentage of the population rooted in Islamic countries is one of the main factors determining the development of the epidemic in Berlin. In order to explain and clarify this conclusion, it is necessary to make further assumptions about the possible emergence of a new strain of coronavirus in Berlin and in Germany and, accordingly, about the possibility of new epidemic waves. A preliminary ratio for predicting the spread of the epidemic under conditions of simultaneous existence of both strains of coronavirus is given.

Simplicity of the proposed prognostic method and high accuracy of the results allow to recommend it as an effective tool for operative analysis of various measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19 epidemic including mass vaccination of population.",Denis Below; Jana Mairanowski; Felix Mairanowski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249117,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249117,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
411,Changes in COVID-19-related outcomes and the impacts of the potential risk factors over time: a follow-up analysis,"ImportanceCharacteristics of COVID-19 patients changed over the course of the pandemic. Understanding how risk factors changed over time can enhance the coordination of healthcare resources and protect the vulnerable.

ObjectiveTo investigate the overall trend of severe COVID-19-related outcomes over time since the start of the pandemic, and to evaluate whether the impacts of potential risk factors, such as race/ethnic groups, changed over time.

DesignThis retrospective cohort study included patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine (MM) from March 10, 2020, to September 2, 2020. According to the quarter in which they first tested positive, the COVID-19-positive cohort were stratified into three groups: Q1, March 1, 2020 - March 31, 2020; Q2, April 1, 2020 - June 30, 2020; Q3, July 1, 2020 - September 2, 2020.

SettingsLarge, academic medical center.

ParticipantsIndividuals tested or treated for COVID-19.

ExposureExamined potential risk factors included age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcomes included COVID-19-related hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality, which were identified from the electronic health records from MM.

ResultsThe study cohort consisted of 53,853 patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at MM, with mean (SD) age of 44.8 (23.1), mean (SD) BMI of 29.1 (7.6), and 23,814 (44.2%) males. Among the 2,582 patients who tested positive, 719 (27.8%) were hospitalized, 377 (14.6%) were admitted to ICU, and 129 (5.0%) died. The overall COVID-positive hospitalization rate decreased from 41.5% in Q1 to 12.6% in Q3, and the overall ICU admission rate decreased from 24.5% to 5.3%. Black patients had significantly higher (unadjusted) overall hospitalization rate (265 [41.1%] vs 326 [23.2%]), ICU admission rate (139 [21.6%] vs 172 [12.2%]), and mortality rate (42 [6.5%] vs 56 [4.0%]) than White patients. Each quarter, the hospitalization rate remained higher for Black patients compared to White patients, but this difference was attenuated over time for the (unadjusted) odds ratios (Q1: OR=1.9, 95% CI [1.25, 2.90]; Q2: OR=1.42, 95% CI [1.02, 1.98]; Q3: OR=1.36, 95% CI [0.67, 2.65]). Similar decreasing patterns were observed for ICU admission and mortality. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, the racial disparities in hospitalization between White and Black patients were not significant in each quarter of the year (Q1: OR=1.43, 95% CI [0.75, 2.71]; Q2: OR=1.25, 95% CI [0.79, 1.98]; Q3: OR=1.76 95% CI [0.81, 3.85]), in contrast to what was observed in the full cohort (OR=1.85, 95% CI [1.39, 2.47]). Additionally, significant association of hospitalization with living in densely populated area was identified in the first quarter (OR= 664, 95% CI [20.4, 21600]), but such association disappeared in the second and third quarters (Q2: OR= 1.72 95% CI [0.22, 13.5]; Q3: OR=3.69, 95% CI [0.103, 132]). Underlying liver diseases were positively associated with hospitalization in White patients (OR=1.60, 95% CI [1.01, 2.55], P=.046), but not in Black patients (OR=0.49, 95% CI [0.23, 1.06], P=.072, Pint=.013). Similar results were obtained for the effect of liver diseases on ICU admission in White and Black patients (White: OR=1.75, 95% CI [1.01, 3.05], P=.047; Black: OR=0.46, 95% CI [0.17, 1.26], P=.130, Pint=.030).

Conclusions and RelevanceThese findings suggest that the COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality rates were decreasing over the course of the pandemic. Although racial disparities persisted, the magnitude of the differences in hospitalization and ICU admission rates diminished over time.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionsC_ST_ABSHow did the overall hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates change over the course of the pandemic and how did they vary by race?

FindingsIn this cohort study of 2,582 patients testing positive for COVID-19, the unadjusted hospitalization rate decreased from 50.5% in Q1 (March 10, 2020, to March 31, 2020) to 17.9% in Q3 (July 1, 2020, to September 2, 2020) for Black patients, and from 23.2% in Q1 to 13.8% in Q3 for White patients. After adjusting for age, sex, sociodemographic factors, and comorbidity conditions, the odds ratios of hospitalization between White and Black patients were not significant in each quarter of the year 2020. No significant associations between ICU admission and race/ethnic groups were identified in each quarter or the entire three quarters.

MeaningThese findings suggests an appreciable decline in hospitalization and ICU admission rates among COVID-19 positive patients.

412,Diagnostic performance and clinical implications of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing in Mexico using real-world nationwide COVID-19 registry data,"BACKGROUNDSARS-CoV-2 testing capacity is important to monitor epidemic dynamics. Given difficulties of large-scale RT-PCR implementation, rapid antigen tests (Rapid Ag-T) have been proposed as alternatives in settings such as Mexico.

OBJECTIVESTo evaluate diagnostic performance of Rapid Ag-T for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated clinical implications compared to RT-PCR testing in Mexico.

METHODSWe analyzed data from the COVID-19 registry of the Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology up to December 31st, 2020 (n=3,374,165) and cases with both RT-PCR and Rapid Ag-T (n=18,446). We evaluated diagnostic performance using accuracy measures and assessed time-dependent changes in AUROC. We also explored test discordances as predictors of hospitalization, intubation, severe COVID-19 and mortality.

RESULTSRapid Ag-T is primarily used in Mexico City. Rapid Ag-T have low sensitivity 37.6% (95%CI 36.6-38.7), high specificity 95.4% (95%CI 95.1-95.8) and acceptable positive 86.1% (95%CI 85.0-86.6) and negative predictive values 67.2% (95%CI 66.2-69.2). Rapid Ag-T has optimal diagnostic performance up to days 7-10 after symptom, and its performance is modified by testing location, comorbidity, and age. RT-PCR(-) / Rapid Ag-T(+) cases had higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes and were older, RT-PCR(+)/ Rapid Ag-T(-) cases had slightly higher risk or adverse outcomes and [&ge;]7 days from symptom onset. Cases detected with rapid Ag-T were younger, without comorbidities, and milder COVID-19 course.

CONCLUSIONSRapid Ag-T could be used as an alternative to RT-PCR for large scale SARS-CoV-2 testing in Mexico.

413,Can Catastrophe Theory explain expansion and contagious of Covid-19?,"Since SARS-Cov-2 started spreading in China and turned into a pandemic disease called Covid-19, many articles about prediction with mathematical model have appeared in the literature. In addition to models in specialized journals, a significant amount of software was made available, presenting with dashboards spreading of the pandemic for each new. These models are solved by computer simulation of traditional exponential models as a representation of the growth of cases and deaths. Some more accurate models are based on existing variations of SIR model (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered). A third class of study is developed in spatial or probabilistic models as a way of forecasting the effect of Covid-19 around the world. Data on the number of positive cases in all countries, show that SARS-Cov-2 shows great resistance even after strategies of lockdown or social distancing. The purpose of this article is to show how the bifurcation theory, known as Catastrophe Theory, can help to understand why Covid-19 expansion rates change so much and even with low values for a longtime trigger contagion quickly and abruptly.

The Catastrophe Theory was conceived by the mathematician Rene Thom in the 60s with wide applications in works in the 70s. The outbreak of spruce budworm in Canada revealed a very interesting opportunity to test Catastrophe Theory whose explanation for the phenomenon was widely debated in the academic world. Inspired by the same mathematical approach to this phenomenon in Canada in the 1970s, we applied the Catastrophe Theory in the current Covid-19 pandemic. We observed that sudden outbreaks occur when the carrying capacity and the rate of expansion of the virus reach a region of bifurcation on the cusp surface. With actual Covid-19 data obtained from WHO, we fitted the dynamic model using the particle swarm technique and compared the results in the bifurcation plan with the Covid-19 outbreaks in different regions of the world. It is possible in many cases to observe the trajectory of the parameters between limit points in the bistable region and the consequent explosion of cases observed for each country assessed.",Marco A L Caetano,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249133,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249133,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
414,"Survival analysis of all critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the main hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia, 30 March to 12 June 2020: what interventions are proving effective?","OBJECTIVESTo determine risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the main public sector hospital in Somalia and identify interventions contributing to improved clinical outcome in a low-resource and fragile setting.

SETTINGMain public sector tertiary hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia.

PARTICIPANTSAll 131 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the main public tertiary hospital in Somalia between 30 March and 12 June 2020.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESWe extracted demographic and clinical data from hospital records of all 131 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital until their death or recovery. We used Kaplan-Meier statistics to estimate survival probabilities and the log-rank test to assess significant differences in survival between groups. We used the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate likelihood of death and assess the effect of risk factors on survival.

RESULTSOf the 131 patients, 52 (40%) died in the hospital and 79 (60%) survived to discharge. The factors independently associated with increased risk of in-hospital death were: age [&ge;] 60 years - survival probability on day 21 in patients < 60 years was 0.789 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.658-0.874) compared with 0.339 (95% CI: 0.205-0.478) in patients [&ge;] 60 years; cardiovascular disease (survival probability 0.478 (95% CI: 0.332-0.610) in patients with cardiovascular disease compared with 0.719 (95% CI: 0.601-0.807) in patients without cardiovascular disease); and non-invasive ventilation on admission - patients who were not ventilated were significantly more likely to survive than those who were (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONOur study, which includes the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to a single hospital in a sub-Saharan African country, confirms that underlying conditions and age are associated with increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19.

415,Implementing Building-Level SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Surveillance on a University Campus,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a source of ongoing challenges and presents an increased risk of illness in group environments, including jails, long term care facilities, schools, and, of course, residential college campuses. Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the universitys fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in identification of smaller clusters than were reported in other types of cluster events. Wastewater surveillance was able to detect single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with total resident populations of 150-200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments.",Cynthia J Gibas; Kevin Lambirth; Neha Mittal; Md Ariful Islam Juel; Visva Bharati Barua; Lauren Roppolo Brazell; Keshawn Hinton; Jordan Lontai; Nicholas Stark; Isaiah Young; Cristine Quach; Morgan Russ; Jacob Kauer; Bridgette Nicolosi; Srinivas Akella; Wenwu Tang; Don Chen; Jessica Schlueter; Mariya Munir,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20248843,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20248843,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
416,"Stages of COVID-19 pandemic and paths to herd immunity by vaccination: dynamical model comparing Austria, Luxembourg and Sweden","BackgroundWorldwide more than 72 million people have been infected and 1.6 million died with SARS-CoV-2 by 15th December 2020. Non-pharmaceutical interventions which decrease social interaction have been implemented to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to mitigate stress on healthcare systems and prevent deaths. The pandemic has been tackled with disparate strategies by distinct countries resulting in different epidemic dynamics. However, with vaccines now becoming available, the current urgent open question is how the interplay between vaccination strategies and social interaction will shape the pandemic in the next months.

MethodsTo address this question, we developed an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model including social interaction, undetected cases and the progression of patients trough hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs) and death. We calibrated our model to data of Luxem-bourg, Austria and Sweden, until 15th December 2020. We incorporated the effect of vaccination to investigate under which conditions herd immunity would be achievable in 2021.

ResultsThe model reveals that Sweden has the highest fraction of undetected cases, Luxembourg displays the highest fraction of infected population, and all three countries are far from herd immunity as of December 2020. The model quantifies the level of social interactions, and allows to assess the level which would keep Reff (t) below 1. In December 2020, this level is around 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic for all the three countries. The model allows to estimate the vaccination rate needed for herd immunity and shows that 2700 vaccinations/day are needed in Luxembourg to reach it by mid of April and 45,000 for Austria and Sweden. The model estimates that vaccinating the whole countrys population within 1 year could lead to herd immunity by July in Luxembourg and by August in Austria and Sweden.

ConclusionThe model allows to shed light on the dynamics of the epidemics in different waves and countries.

417,Need of care in interpreting Google Trends-based COVID-19 infodemiological study results: potential risk of false-positivity,"ObjectiveGoogle Trends (GT) is being used as an epidemiological tool to study coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by identifying keywords in search trends that are predictive for the COVID-19 epidemiological burden. However, many of the earlier GT-based studies include potential statistical fallacies by measuring the correlation between non-stationary time sequences without adjusting for multiple comparisons or the confounding of media coverage, leading to concerns about the increased risk of obtaining false-positive results. In this study, we aimed to apply statistically more favorable methods to validate the earlier GT-based COVID-19 study results.

MethodsWe extracted the relative GT search volume for keywords associated with COVID-19 symptoms, and evaluated their Granger-causality to weekly COVID-19 positivity in eight English-speaking countries and Japan. In addition, the impact of media coverage on keywords with significant Granger-causality was further evaluated using Japanese regional data.

ResultsOur Granger causality-based approach largely decreased (by up to approximately one-third) the number of keywords identified as having a significant temporal relationship with the COVID-19 trend when compared to those identified by the Pearson correlation-based approach. ""Sense of smell"" and ""loss of smell"" were the most reliable GT keywords across all the evaluated countries; however, when adjusted with their media coverage, these keyword trends did not Granger-cause the COVID-19 positivity trends (in Japan).

ConclusionOur results suggest that some of the search keywords reported as candidate predictive measures in earlier GT-based COVID-19 studies may potentially be unreliable; therefore, caution is necessary when interpreting published GT-based study results.",Kenichiro Sato; Tatsuo Mano; Atsushi Iwata; Tatsushi Toda,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249066,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249066,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
418,Divergences on expected pneumonia cases during the COVID-19 epidemic in Catalonia: A time-series analysis of primary care electronic health records covering about 6 million people.,"BackgroundPneumonia is one of the complications of COVID-19. Primary care electronic health records (EHR) have shown the utility as a surveillance system.

AimTo analyze the trends of pneumonia during two waves of COVID-19 pandemic in order to use it as a clinical surveillance system and an early indicator of severity.

MethodsTime series analysis of pneumonia cases, January 2014-December 2020. We collected pneumonia diagnoses from primary care EHR, covering >6 million people in Catalonia (Spain). We compared the trend of pneumonia in the season 2019-2020 with that in the previous years. We estimated the expected pneumonia cases with data from 2014 to 2018 using a time series regression adjusted by seasonality and influenza epidemics.

ResultsBetween 4 March and 5 May 2020, 11,704 excess pneumonia cases (95% CI: 9,909 to 13,498) were identified. We observed a second excess pneumonia period from 22 october to 15 november of 1,377 excess cases (95% CI: 665 to 2,089). In contrast, we observed two great periods with reductions of pneumonia cases in children, accounting for 131 days and 3,534 less pneumonia cases (95% CI: 1,005 to 6,064) from March to July; and 54 days and 1,960 less pneumonia cases (95% CI 917 to 3,002) from October to December.

MethodsA cross sectional household and online survey was conducted during the months of June-to- August. The study was conducted among adult between age 18 above in communities of western Uganda who consented to participate in the study. Study participants were selected using a convenience sampling technique and sampling was done by sending a structured online questionnaire via Google forms and a printed copies questionnaire made available to other participants that did not use the online questionnaire

ResultsThe percentage of respondents that know about self-medication is (97%) and those that practice self-medication are approximately (88%). 97% of respondents have heard about self-medication either through health workers, media, family members, friends and/or school while 3% said they have not heard about self-medication. The percentage of respondents who practiced self- medication during COVID-19 pandemic is 57% while those that did not is 43%. There is statistically difference in the number of those that practice self-medication and those that do not p < 0.005 at 95% confidence interval. Also there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of respondents that practice self-medication during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown compare to the practice before the pandemic lockdown p < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval.

ConclusionOur investigation showed adequate knowledge of self-medication and high level of self- medication practice with a decrease in self-medication practices during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown compared to the practice before the lockdown.",Samuel Sunday Dare; Ejike Daniel Eze; Isaac Echoru; Ibe Michael Usman; Fred Ssempijja; Edmund Eriya Bukenya; Robinson Ssebuufu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.20248576,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.20248576,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
420,"Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 among healthcare workers in public health facilities, Eastern Ethiopia","On 13 March 2020, Ethiopia reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa. COVID-19 is likely to overwhelm an already fragile health-care delivery system and reduce the availability of services for endemic health concerns such as malaria and diarrheal diseases.

Cross sectional study was conducted on heath care workers in three public health facilities in Somali region to assess knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19. T-test and ANOVA were used to analyze the relationship between the dependent, and independent variables. Spearmans correlation was used to assess the relationship between mean knowledge and attitude scores.

A vast majority of the participants were male (n = 293, 67.5%), with a mean age of 27.6 (SD: 5.3) years. The mean knowledge score was 13.7 (SD: 2.6) and the mean attitude score 10.5 (SD: 4.1). Only 45.2 % (n = 196) of the participants had a good attitude toward COVID-19. There was a negative correlation between knowledge scores, attitude scores (r=-0.295, P<0.001) and practice (r=-0.298, P<0.001).

The overall level of knowledge was good. However, the attitude and practice were relatively low.

421,Do school closures reduce community transmission of COVID-19? A systematic review of observational studies,"IntroductionSchool closures are associated with significant negative consequences and may exacerbate inequalities. They were implemented worldwide to control SARS-CoV-2 in the first half of 2020, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This review summarises the empirical evidence of their effect on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.

MethodsThe study protocol was registered on Prospero (ID:CRD42020213699). On 12 October 2020 we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19 Research Database, ERIC, the British Education Index, and the Australian Education Index. We included empirical studies with quantitative estimates of the effect of school closures/reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. We excluded prospective modelling studies and intra-school transmission studies. We performed a narrative synthesis due to data heterogeneity.

ResultsWe identified 3,318 articles, of which ten were included, with data from 146 countries. All studies assessed school closures, and one additionally examined re-openings. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Three studies, including the two at lowest risk of bias, reported no impact of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 transmission; whilst the other seven reported protective effects. Effect sizes ranged from no association to substantial and important reductions in community transmission.

DiscussionStudies were at risk of confounding and collinearity from other non-pharmacological interventions implemented close to school closures. Our results are consistent with school closures being ineffective to very effective. This variation may be attributable to differences in study design or real differences. With such varied evidence on effectiveness, and the harmful effects, policymakers should take a measured approach before implementing school closures.

Panel:  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA previous systematic review, published by some of us in April 2020, found good evidence that school closures are effective for the control of influenza, but limited evidence of effectiveness for coronavirus outbreaks. At the time there was no available empirial evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Added value of this studyThis study is the first systematic review of the empirical evidence from observational studies of the effect of school closures and reopenings on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We include 10 studies, covering 146 countries. There was significant heterogeneity between studies. Some studies reported large reductions in incidence and mortality associated with school closures, however, studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity, and studies at lower risk of bias reported no association.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe evidence is consistent with either no effect, or a protective effect of school closures.

422,COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Among Health Care Workers in the United States,"BackgroundAcceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine will play a major role in combating the pandemic. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are amongst the first group to receive vaccination, so it is important to consider their attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination to better address barriers to widespread vaccination acceptance.

MethodsWe conducted a cross sectional study to assess the attitude of HCWs toward COVID-19 vaccination. Data was collected between October 7th and November 9th, 2020. We received 4080 responses out of which 3479 were complete responses and were included in final analysis.

Results36% of respondents were willing to take the vaccine as soon as it became available while 56% were not sure or would wait to review more data. Vaccine acceptance increased with increasing age, education, and income level. Lower acceptance was noted in females (31%), Black (10%), Latinx (30%) and Conservative/Republican (21%) HCWs, and those working in a rural setting (26%). Direct medical care providers had higher vaccine acceptance (49%). Safety (69%), effectiveness (69%) and speed of development/approval (74%) were noted as the most common concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination in our survey.

ConclusionImmediate acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine is low, with the majority of HCWs choosing to wait to review more data before deciding on personal vaccination. Overall attitudes toward vaccination were positive but specific concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine are prevalent. Differences in vaccine acceptance were noted between individual and group characteristics which should be addressed to avoid exacerbating health inequities.",Rahul Shekhar; Abu Baker Sheikh; Shubhra Upadhyay; Mriganka Singh; Saket Kottewar; Hamza Mir; Eileen Barrett; Suman Pal,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249184,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249184,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
423,Spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks in South Carolina: A time series forecasting analysis,"BackgroundPopulation mobility is closely associated with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) transmission, and it could be used as a proximal indicator to predict future outbreaks, which could inform proactive non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease control. South Carolina (SC) is one of the states which reopened early and then suffered from a sharp increase of COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility to predict daily new cases at both state- and county- levels in SC.

MethodsThis longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020 in SC and its top five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases. Daily new case was calculated by subtracting the cumulative confirmed cases of previous day from the total cases. Population mobility was assessed using the number of users with travel distance larger than 0.5 mile which was calculated based on their geotagged twitters. Poisson count time series model was employed to carry out the research goals.

ResultsPopulation mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence and those of the top five counties (i.e., Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, Richland). At the state-level, final model with time window within the last 7-day had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3-, 7-, 14- days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9-, 14-, 28-, 20-, and 9- days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3% to 74.5%.

ConclusionsPopulation mobility was positively associated with COVID-19 incidences at both state- and county- levels in SC. Using Twitter-based mobility data could provide acceptable prediction for COVID-19 daily new cases. Population mobility measured via social media platform could inform proactive measures and resource relocations to curb disease outbreaks and their negative influences.",Chengbo Zeng; Jiajia Zhang; Zhenlong Li; Xiaowen Sun; Bankole Olatosi; Sharon Weissman; Xiaoming Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249119,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249119,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
424,Burden of predominant psychological reactions among the healthcare workers and general during COVID-19 pandemic phase: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"AimPresent systematic review and meta-analysis examined the burden of psychological reactions predominantly anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia during novel COVID-19 pandemic phase among the frontline healthcare, non-frontline healthcare and general.

MethodologyPubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS were searched for studies between Jan 1, 2020 to May 25, 2020. Brief protocol of the systematic review was registered with the PROSPERO database, (CRD42020186229).Any study that reported the burden of at least one of psychological reactions including anxiety or depression or stress or insomnia was eligible. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic and results were synthesized using random effect meta-analysis.

ResultsOut of 52eligible studies, 43 reported anxiety, 43 reported depression, 20 reported stress and 11 reported insomnia. Overall prevalence for anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were 26.6%, 26.2%,26.2% and 34.4% respectively. Anxiety and depression were found highest among the COVID-19 patients (43.3% and 51.75 respectively). Apart from COVID-19 patients, prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were found highest among the frontline healthcare (27.2%, 32.1%,55.6% and 34.4% respectively) as compared to general healthcare workers (26.9%, 15.7%, 7.0% and 34.0% respectively) and general population (25.9%, 25.9%,25.4% and 29.4% respectively).

ConclusionAnxiety and depression were found highest among the COVID-19 patients. Apart from COVID-19 patients, the anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were more prevalent among frontline healthcare workers compared to general. Such increased prevalence is prompting towards the global mental health emergency. Therefore a call of urgent attention and pan-region effective mental-health intervention are required to mitigate these psychological reactions.",Bhaskar Thakur; Mona Pathak,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249126,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.21249126,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True

The Brazilian model estimation for SARS-CoV-2 peak contagion (BMESPC) was structured, capable of estimating the peak of contagion for SARS-CoV-2 in the first and second waves, as the main objective of this work. Using the BMESPC model, it was possible to estimate, with a certain reliability degree, the peak of contagion for the first and second waves in Brazil, with one day difference from the real to the forecast. While at the state level, the calculated confidence interval proved to be more accurate. In this way, it is possible to use BMESPC to forecast the peak of contagion for several regions, provided that the necessary structure and calibration are respected.",Guilherme Asai; Andre Kuroiva; Manuella Lucca Terra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.20248940,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.20248940,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
426,Humoral and cell-mediated response in colostrum after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"BackgroundColostrum provides an immune sharing between a mother and her infant. The transfer in colostrum of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the elicited cytokines may provide crucial protection to the infant. There is limited literature on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 present in colostrum.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and the associated cytokines in colostrum from women who tested positive for the virus.

Study DesignBetween March and September 2020 we obtained bilateral colostrum samples collected on spot cards within 48 hours of delivery from 15 new mothers who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Five of these 15 COVID-19 positive women also provided bilateral liquid colostrum within 1-2 days of providing the spot card samples. Archived bilateral colostrum samples collected from 8 women during 2011-2013 were used as pre-COVID-19 controls. All samples were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an ELISA that measures SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM, and for concentrations of 10 inflammatory cytokines (IFN{gamma}, TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13) using a multiplex electrochemiluminescent sandwich assay.

ResultsBilateral colostrum samples from 73%, 73% and 33% of the 15 COVID-19 mothers exhibited IgA, IgG, and IgM reactivity to RBD respectively. Colostrum samples from two of the 8 pre-pandemic controls showed IgA and IgG reactivity to RBD. Additionally, COVID-19 mothers had significantly higher levels of 9 of the 10 inflammatory markers (all except IFN{gamma}) as compared to the pre-COVID-19 controls. Comparable results were obtained with both the spot card-eluates and liquid samples.

ConclusionsA strong humoral immune response is present in the colostrum of women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before delivering. High levels of 9 inflammatory markers were also present in the colostrum. The evolution and duration of the antibody response, as well as dynamics of the cytokine response, remain to be determined. Our results also indicate that future large-scale studies can be conducted with milk easily collected on paper spot cards.",Vignesh Narayanaswamy; Brian Pentecost; Dominique Alfandari; Emily Chin; Kathleen Minor; Alyssa Kastrinakis; Tanya Lieberman; Kathleen F Arcaro; Heidi Leftwich,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.20248715,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.20248715,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
427,Nested pool testing strategy for the reliable identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2,"The progress of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires the design of cost-effective testing programs at large scale. To this end, pooling multiple samples can provide a solution. Defining a cost-effective strategy requires the establishment of an efficient deconvolution and re-testing procedure that eventually allows the identifcation of the carrier. Based on Dorfmans algorithm, we developed an adaptive nested strategy for which we have, for a given prevalence, simple analytic expressions of the optimal number of samples in the starting pool, of the number of partitioning steps (stages) in the optimal path, of the pool sizes in each of these stages and of the expected average number of tests needed to identify the infected individuals. In this paper we analyze the strategy in detail focusing on its practical implementation when there are restrictions that prevent the use of the optimum. More specifically, we analyze how to proceed when the infection prevalence is poorly known a priori or when the optimal requires starting with pool sizes that are too large for the reliable detection of an infected sample. The sensitivity of the RT-qPCR assay, the gold standard RNA detection method, is a major concern in the case of SARS-CoV-2: it is estimated that half of the infected individuals give false negative results. Recently, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was shown to be 10 - 100 times more sensitive than RT-qPCR, making this technology suitable for pool testing. ddPCR has the added value of providing the direct quantification of the RNA content at the end of the test. In the paper we show how this feature can be used for verification purposes. The analyses and strategies presented here should be useful to those considering the adoption of a pooling approach for RNA detection, particularly, for the identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Author summaryThe progress of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires the design of cost-effective testing programs at large scale. Running tests on pooled samples can provide a solution if the tests sensitivity is high enough. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the current gold standard test, RT-qPCR, has shown some limitations that only allow the use of pools with relatively few samples. In this regard, Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has been shown to be 10 - 100 times more sensitive than RT-qPCR, making it suitable for test pooling. In this paper we describe a nested pool testing method in which the properties that make it optimal are simple analytic functions of the infection prevalence. We discuss how to proceed in practical implementations of the strategy, particularly when there are constraints that prevent the use of the optimal. We also show how its nested nature can be combined with the direct RNA quantification that the ddPCR test provides to identify the presence of unviable samples in the pools and for self-consistency tests. The studies of this paper should be useful for those considering the adoption of test pooling for RNA detection.",Ines Armendariz; Pablo A Ferrari; Daniel Fraiman; Jose Mario Martinez; Hugo G Menzella; Silvina Ponce Dawson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249170,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249170,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
428,Evaluation of serological lateral flow assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However, standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are needed.

MethodsWe evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests in April 2020. We evaluated the assays performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10-40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence.

ResultsCombined IgG+IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9% to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6% to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG+IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG+IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1 g/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 g/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and Vivachek.

ConclusionWe provide a public resource of the accuracy of select lateral flow assays with potential for home testing. The cost-effectiveness, scalable manufacturing process, and suitability for self-testing makes LFAs an attractive option for monitoring disease prevalence and assessing vaccine responsiveness. Our web tool provides an easy-to-use interface to demonstrate the impact of prevalence and test accuracy on the positive predictive values.",Bianca A. Trombetta; Savannah E. Kandigian; Robert R.

429,Autoimmune anti-DNA antibodies predict disease severity in COVID-19 patients,"COVID-19 can lead to severe disease and death, however the mechanisms of pathogenesis in these patients remain poorly understood. High levels of autoimmune antibodies have been observed frequently in COVID-19 patients but their specific contribution to disease severity and clinical manifestations remain unknown.

We performed a retrospective study of 115 COVID-19 hospitalized patients with different degrees of severity to analyze the generation of autoimmune antibodies to common antigens: a lysate of erythrocytes, the lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and DNA.

High levels of IgG autoantibodies against erythrocyte lysates were observed in a large percentage (up to 41%) of patients. Anti-DNA antibodies determined upon hospital admission correlated strongly with later development of severe disease, showing a positive predictive value of 89.5% and accounting for 22% of total severe cases. Statistical analysis identified strong correlations between anti-DNA antibodies and markers of cell injury, coagulation, neutrophil levels and erythrocyte size.

430,SARS-CoV-2 induces a durable and antigen specific humoral immunity after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 infection,"Current SARS-CoV-2 serological assays generate discrepant results, and the longitudinal characteristics of antibodies targeting various antigens after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 are yet to be established. This longitudinal cohort study including 1972 healthcare workers, of which 386 participants exhibited antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at study inclusion, reveal that these antibodies remain detectable in the vast majority of participants, 98%, at least four months post infection, despite having had no or mild symptoms. These antibody levels did not differ from those found in 59 convalescent COVID-19 patients (p=0.7). Virus neutralization capacity was confirmed by microneutralization assay in 93% of study participants at least four months post infection. Contrary to antibodies targeting the spike protein, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were only detected in 68% of previously anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive healthcare workers, and these four-month follow-up levels were substantially lower in healthcare workers than in convalescent COVID-19 patients (p=2*10-5). Our findings support a durable and functional humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, even after no or mild symptoms. We further demonstrate differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen, arguing against the use of the nucleocapsid protein as target antigen in population-based SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys.",Sebastian Havervall; August Jernbom Falk; Jonas Klingstrom; Henry Ng; Nina Greilert Norin; Lena Gabrielsson; Ann-Christine Salomonsson; Eva Isaksson; Ann-Sofie Rudberg; Cecilia Hellstrom; Eni Andersson; Jennie Olofsson; Lovisa Skoglund; Jamil Yousef; Elisa Pin; Wanda Christ; Mikaela Olausson; My Hedhammar; Hanna Tegel; Sara Mangsbo; Mia Phillipson; Anna Manberg; Sophia Hober; Peter Nilsson; Charlotte Thalin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249162,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249162,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
431,The Impact of the November 2020 English National Lockdown on COVID-19 case counts,"In the UK the epidemic of COVID-19 continues to pose a significant threat to public health. On the 14th October the English government introduced a tier system for control of the epidemic but just 3 weeks later a National lockdown across all areas of England was implemented. When English areas emerged from Lockdown many were placed in different tiers (most typically moved up at least one tier). However, the effectiveness of the tier system has been challenged by the emergence of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 which appears to be much more infectious. In addition, from early November a trial mass testing service was being run in Liverpool. We used publicly available data of daily cases by local authority (local government areas) and estimated the reproductive rate (R value) of the epidemic based on 7-day case numbers compared with the previous 7-day period. There was a clear surge in infections from a few days before to several days after the lockdown was implemented. But this surge was almost exclusively associated with Tier 1 and Tier 2 authorities. In Tier 3 authorities where hospitality venues were only allowed to operate as restaurants there was no such surge. After this initial surge, cases declined in all three tiers with the R value dropping to a mean of about 0.7 independent of tier. London, The South East and East of England Regions saw rising infection rates in the last week or so of lockdown primarily in children of secondary school age. We could find no obvious benefit of the trial mass screening programme in Liverpool city. We conclude that in Tiers 1 and 2 much of the beneficial impact of the national lockdown was lost probably because of the leak of its likely implementation five days early leading to increased socialising in these areas before the start of lockdown. We further conclude that given that the new variant is estimated to have an R value of between 0.39 and 0.93 greater than previous variants, any lockdown as strict as the November one would be insufficient to reverse the increase in infections by itself. The value of city-wide mass testing to control the epidemic remains uncertain.",Paul R Hunter; Julii Suzanne Brainard; Alastair R Grant,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249169,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249169,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
432,How vaccination and contact isolation might interact to suppress transmission of Covid-19: a DCM study,"This report describes a dynamic causal model that could be used to address questions about the rollout and efficacy of vaccines in the United Kingdom. For example, is suppression of community transmission a realistic aspiration? And, if not, what kind of endemic equilibrium might be achieved? What percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated? And over what timescale? It focuses on the synergies among (i) vaccination, (ii) the supported isolation of contacts of confirmed cases and (iii) restrictions on contact rates (i.e., lockdown and social distancing). To model these mitigations, we used a dynamic causal model that embeds an epidemiological model into agent-based behavioural model. The model structure and parameters were optimised to best explain responses--to the first and subsequent waves--enabling predictions over the forthcoming year under counterfactual scenarios. Illustrative analyses suggest that the full potential of vaccination is realised by increasing the efficacy of contact tracing: for example, under idealised (best case) assumptions--of an effective vaccine and efficient isolation of infected pre-symptomatic cases-- suppression of community transmission would require 50% herd immunity by vaccinating 22% by the end of 2021; i.e., 15 million people or about 50,000 per day. With no change in the isolation of contacts, 36% would require vaccination, i.e., 25 million people. These figures should not be read as estimates of the actual number of people requiring vaccination; however, they illustrate the potential of this kind of model to quantify interactions among public health interventions.

433,"What is the value of community oximetry monitoring in people with SARS-CoV-2? A prospective, open-label clinical study","BackgroundIn people with COVID-19, hypoxia at the time of admission is known to be related to mortality. Monitoring of oxygen saturations (SpO2) is therefore an increasingly common part of community-based care, with the aim of improving the identification of adults who are deteriorating. We set out to investigate whether rigid SpO2 triggers, or absolute change in SpO2, is more indicative of deterioration in COVID-19.

MethodsA prospective, uncontrolled, open-label study in a large UK general practice was conducted between May and November 2020. Participants recorded twice daily oximetry and symptom diary for 14 days after test-confirmed COVID-19. Primary outcomes were the proportion of people whose SpO2 dropped to [&le;] 94% and [&le;] 92%, the average maximum reduction in SpO2, and admission to hospital. We also investigated the relationship between MRC Dyspnoea scale, modified Roth score, and SpO2 through correlation analyses.

Results52 participants were recruited, following which 41 participants completed the study. The average age was 45.9 years with 63.4% identifying as female. The mean maximum reduction in SpO2 was 2.8%. The average time to maximum reduction in SpO2 was 6.4 days. Nine participants (22.0%) had a reduction in SpO2 to [&le;]94%. Three of these had a reduction in SpO2 to [&le;]92%, for which all three were admitted to hospital. Modified Roth score and SpO2 were weakly positively correlated (.31). MRC dyspnoea scale score and SpO2 were moderately negatively correlated (-.53).

ConclusionsA reduction in SpO2 to [&le;]92% was found to be highly predictive for admission to hospital. Modified Roth score or MRC dyspnoea scale scores should not be used as proxy measures for oximetry. This study contributes to the ongoing narrative around community-based oximetry and provides insight and recommendations for those currently engaging in or planning to roll out similar schemes.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis study is pragmatically designed to answer an important clinical question in primary care.
C_LIO_LIThis study focused on previously published values of SpO2 for triggering escalation of care and therefore provides answers based on current clinical practice.
C_LIO_LI11 of the 52 patients who were recruited into the study did not return their oximeter or oximetry diary at the end of the study period.
C_LIO_LIWe did not validate the accuracy or reliability of the oximetry / symptom diaries, as these were self-completed by the participants themselves.
C_LIO_LIOther than admission to hospital and mortality within the study period, no other clinical outcomes have been recorded.

434,Mental health of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and evidence-based frameworks for mitigation: A rapid review,"BackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the mental health of health care workers (HCWs), and optimal strategies to provide psychological support for HCWs are not currently established.

AimsTo rapidly review recently-published literature on the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsQuery of all quantitative research through the PubMed database on the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic which utilized validated mental health instruments. 723 articles were screened and 87 articles were included.

ResultsNearly all included studies were cross-sectional, survey-based assessments of the prevalence of and risk factors for mental illness. Only one interventional study was identified. Prevalence of mental health outcomes varied widely: 7.0-97.3% anxiety, 10.6-62.1% depression, 2.2-93.8% stress, 3.8-56.6% post traumatic stress, 8.3-88.4% insomnia, and 21.8-46.3% burnout. Risk and protective factors were identified in personal and professional domains, including degree of COVID-19 exposure, adequacy of protective equipment, and perception of organizational support.

ConclusionsThe myriad risk factors for poor mental health among HCWs suggests that a comprehensive psychosocial support model with individual- and organization-level interventions is necessary.

435,On the lag between deaths and infections in the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic,"One of the key issues in fighting the current pandemic, or the ones to come, is to obtain objective quantitative indicators of the effectiveness of the measures taken to contain the epidemic. The aim of this work is to point out that the lag between the daily number of infections and casualties provides one such indicator. For this we determined the lag during the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic for a series of countries using the data available at the server of the John Hopkins University using three different methods. Somewhat surprisingly, we find a lag varying substantially between countries, taking negative values (thus the maximum daily number of casulties preceding the maximum daily namber of new infections) in countries where no steps to contain the epidemic have been taken at the outset, with an average lag of 7 {+/-} 0.3 days. Our results can be useful to health authorities in a search for the best strategy to fight the epidemic.

Key MessagesO_LIThe lags between the maximum daily infections and casualties during the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic differ widely between countries.
C_LIO_LIThese lags are clear for some countries, but impossible to determine confidently for most.
C_LIO_LIIn some countries the day at which the maximal number of daily deaths is attained precedes the day of the maximal number of casualties, indicating a failure to protect the most vulnerable part of the population.

436,"Accuracy of the Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index for predicting short-term mortality among 1,307 Yale New Haven Hospital inpatients and 427,224 Medicare patients","BackgroundThe Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index incorporates age, sex, and pre-existing comorbidity diagnoses readily available in the electronic health record (EHR) to predict 30-day all-cause mortality in both inpatients and outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We examined the performance of the Index using data from Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) and national Medicare data overall, over time, and within important patient subgroups.

Methods and findingsWith measures and weights previously derived and validated in a national Veterans Healthcare Administration (VA) sample, we evaluated the accuracy of the VACO Index for estimating inpatient (YNHH) and both inpatient and outpatient mortality (Medicare) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and comparisons of predicted versus observed mortality by decile (calibration plots). The VACO Index demonstrated similar discrimination and calibration in both settings, over time, and among important patient subgroups including women, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans. In sensitivity analyses, we allowed component variables to be re-weighted in the validation datasets and found that weights were largely consistent with those determined in VA data. Supplementing the VACO Index with body mass index and race/ethnicity had no effect on discrimination.

ConclusionAmong COVID-19 positive individuals, the VACO Index accurately estimates risk of short-term mortality among a wide variety of patients. While it modestly over-estimates risk in recent intervals, the Index consistently identifies those at greatest relative risk. The VACO Index could identify individuals who should continue practicing social distancing, help determine who should be prioritized for vaccination, and among outpatients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicate who should receive greater clinical attention or monoclonal antibodies.",Joseph T King Jr.; James S Yoon; Zachary M Bredl; Joseph P Habboushe; Graham A Walker; Christopher T Rentsch; Janet P Tate; Nitu M Kashyap; Richard C Hintz II; Aneesh P Chopra; Amy C Justice,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.01.20249069,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.01.20249069,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,True
437,Laboratory Biomarkers of COVID-19 Disease Severity and Outcome: Findings from a Developing Country,"AimTo identify laboratory biomarkers that predict disease severity and outcome among COVID-19 patients admitted to the Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among 429 RT-PCR confirmed COVID- 19 patients who were on follow up from July to October 2020 and with complete clinical and laboratory data. Data was described using frequency tables. Robust Poisson regression model was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 disease severity where adjusted relative risk (RR), P-value and 95% CI for RR were used to test significance and interpretation of results. Binary Logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of statistically significant association between the explanatory variables and COVID-19 disease outcome where adjusted odds ratio, P- value and 95% CI for adjusted odds ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results

ResultsAmong the 429 patients studied, 182 (42.4%) had Severe disease at admission and the rest 247 (57.6%) had Non-severe disease (15.6% mild and 42.0% moderate). Regarding disease outcome, 45 (10.5%) died and 384 (89.5%) were discharged alive. Age group (ARR= 1.779, 95% CI= 1.405- 2.252, p-value < 0.0001), Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (ARR= 4.769, 95% CI= 2.419 - 9.402 p-value <0.0001), Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (ARR= 1.358, 95% CI= 1.109- 1.662 p-value=0.003), Sodium (ARR= 1.321, 95% CI= 1.091- 1.600 p-value=0.004) and Potassium (ARR= 1.269, 95% CI= 1.059-1.521 p-value=0.010) were found to be significant predictors of COVID-19 disease severity.

The following factors were significantly associated with COVID-19 disease outcome; age group (AOR= 2.767, 95% CI= 1.099 - 6.067, p-value=0.031), white blood cell count (AOR= 4.253, 95% CI= 1.918 - 9.429, p-value=0.0001) and sodium level (AOR= 3.435, 95% CI= 1.439, 8.198, p-value=0.005).

ConclusionsThe laboratory markers of NLR of above three, raised SGOT and deranged sodium and potassium levels (both hypo- and hyper-states) were found to be significant predictors of developing severe COVID-19 disease. In addition, deranged values of white blood cell count and sodium levels were significantly associated with worse outcome of the disease. Therefore, assessing and monitoring these laboratory markers at the earliest stage of the disease could have a considerable impact in halting disease progression and death.",Tigist W.

438,Structure-function investigation of a new VUI-202012/01 SARS-CoV-2 variant,"The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus) has accumulated multiple mutations during its global circulation. Recently, a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 (VUI 202012/01) had been identified leading to sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in South-East England. The strain has accumulated 23 mutations which have been linked to its immune evasion and higher transmission capabilities. Here, we have highlighted structural-function impact of crucial mutations occurring in spike (S), ORF8 and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Some of these mutations might confer higher fitness to SARS-CoV-2.

SummarySince initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city of central China, its causative agent; SARS-CoV-2 virus has claimed more than 1.7 million lives out of 77 million populations and still counting. As a result of global research efforts involving public-private-partnerships, more than 0.2 million complete genome sequences have been made available through Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Similar to previously characterized coronaviruses (CoVs), the positive-sense single-stranded RNA SARS-CoV-2 genome codes for ORF1ab non-structural proteins (nsp(s)) followed by ten or more structural/nsps [1, 2]. The structural proteins include crucial spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins. The S protein mediates initial contacts with human hosts while the E and M proteins function in viral assembly and budding. In recent reports on evolution of SARS-CoV-2, three lineage defining non-synonymous mutations; namely D614G in S protein (Clade G), G251V in ORF3a (Clade V) and L84S in ORF 8 (Clade S) were observed [2-4]. The latest pioneering works by Plante et al and Hou et al have shown that compared to ancestral strain, the ubiquitous D614G variant (clade G) of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits efficient replication in upper respiratory tract epithelial cells and transmission, thereby conferring higher fitness [5, 6]. As per latest WHO reports on COVID-19, a new strain referred as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01) had been identified as a part of virological and epidemiological analysis, due to sudden rise in COVID-19 detected cases in South-East England [7]. Preliminary reports from UK suggested higher transmissibility (increase by 40-70%) of this strain, escalating Ro (basic reproduction number) of virus to 1.5-1.7 [7, 8]. This apparent fast spreading variant inculcates 23 mutations; 13 non-synonymous, 6 synonymous and 4 amino acid deletions [7]. In the current scenario, where immunization programs have already commenced in nations highly affected by COVID-19, advent of this new strain variant has raised concerns worldwide on its possible role in disease severity and antibody responses. The mutations also could also have significant impact on diagnostic assays owing to S gene target failures.",Jasdeep Singh; Nasreen Z Ehtesham; Syed Asad Rahman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.01.425028,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.01.425028,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,False
439,Spike protein disulfide disruption as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2,"The coronaviral pandemic is exerting a tremendously detrimental impact on global health, quality of life and the world economy, emphasizing the need for effective medications for current and future coronaviral outbreaks as a complementary approach to vaccines. The Spike protein, responsible for cell receptor binding and viral internalization, possesses multiple disulfide bonds raising the possibility that disulfide-reducing agents might disrupt Spike function, prevent viral entry and serve as effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show the first experimental evidence that reagents capable of reducing disulfide bonds can inhibit viral infection in cell-based assays. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) predict increased domain flexibility when the four disulfide bonds of the domain are reduced. This flexibility is particularly prominent for the surface loop, comprised of residues 456-490, which interacts with the Spike cell receptor ACE2. Consistent with this finding, the addition of exogenous disulfide bond reducing agents affects the RBD secondary structure, lowers its melting temperature from 52 to 36-39{degrees}C and decreases its binding affinity to ACE2 by two orders of magnitude at 37{degrees}C. Finally, the reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) inhibit viral replication at high {micro}M - low mM levels with a negligible effect on cell viability at these concentrations. The antiviral effect of monothiol-based reductants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not observed due to decreases in cell viability. Our research demonstrates the clear potential for medications that disrupt Spike disulfides as broad-spectrum anticoronaviral agents and as a first-line defense against current and future outbreaks.",Andrey M.

440,The ancient cardioprotective mechanisms of ACE2 bestow SARS-CoV-2 with a wide host range,"SARS-CoV-2 infects a broader range of mammalian species than previously anticipated, suggesting there may be additional unknown hosts wherein the virus can evolve and potentially circumvent effective vaccines. We find that SARS-CoV-2 gains a wide host range by binding ACE2 sites essential for ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Six mutations found only in rodent species immune to SARS-CoV-2 are sufficient to abolish viral binding to human and dog ACE2. This is achieved through context-dependent mutational effects (intramolecular epistasis) conserved despite ACE2 sequence divergence between species. Across mammals, this epistasis generates sequence-function diversity, but through structures all bound by SARS-CoV-2. Mutational trajectories to the mouse conformation not bound by SARS-CoV-2 are blocked, by single mutations functionally deleterious in isolation, but compensatory in combination, explaining why human polymorphisms at these sites are virtually non-existent. Closed to humans, this path was opened to rodents via permissive cardiovascular phenotypes and ancient increases to ACE2 activity, serendipitously granting SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This reveals how ancient evolutionary trajectories are linked with unprecedented phenotypes such as COVID-19 and suggests extreme caution should be taken to monitor and prevent emerging animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.

441,Glycan reactive anti-HIV-1 antibodies bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein but do not block viral entry,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a focal point for vaccine immunogen and therapeutic antibody design, and also serves as a critical antigen in the evaluation of immune responses to COVID-19. A common feature amongst enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 is the propensity for displaying host-derived glycans on entry spike proteins. Similarly displayed glycosylation motifs can serve as the basis for glyco-epitope mediated cross-reactivity by antibodies, which can have important implications on virus neutralization, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and the interpretation of antibody titers in serological assays. From a panel of nine anti-HIV-1 gp120 reactive antibodies, we selected two (PGT126 and PGT128) that displayed high levels of cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We report that these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and are unlikely to mediate ADE via Fc{gamma}RII receptor engagement. Nevertheless, ELISA and other immunoreactivity experiments demonstrate these antibodies are capable of binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike in a glycan-dependent manner. These results contribute to the growing literature surrounding SARS-CoV-2 S cross-reactivity, as we demonstrate the ability for cross-reactive antibodies to interfere in immunoassays.",Dhiraj Mannar; Karoline Leopold; Sriram Subramaniam,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.425141,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.425141,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,False
442,Comprehensive mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain that affect recognition by polyclonal human serum antibodies,"The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent serum antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spikes receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of serum neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal serum antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but there is substantial variation in the impact of mutations both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBDs receptor binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some sera is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in emerging viral lineages in South Africa and Brazil.

443,SARS-CoV-2 Fusion Peptide has a Greater Membrane Perturbating Effect than SARS-CoV with Highly Specific Dependence on Ca2+,"Coronaviruses are a major infectious disease threat, and include the zoonotic-origin human pathogens SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (SARS-2, SARS-1, and MERS). Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the spike (S) protein. In our previous ESR studies, the local membrane ordering effect of the fusion peptide (FP) of various viral glycoproteins including the S of SARS-1 and MERS has been consistently observed. We previously determined that the sequence immediately downstream from the S2 cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP. In this study, we used sequence alignment to identify the SARS-2 FP, and studied its membrane ordering effect. Although there are only three residue difference, SARS-2 FP induces even greater membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, possibly due to its greater hydrophobicity. This may be a reason that SARS-2 is better able to infect host cells. In addition, the membrane binding enthalpy for SARS-2 is greater. Both the membrane ordering of SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs are dependent on Ca2+, but that of SARS-2 shows a greater response to the presence of Ca2+. Both FPs bind two Ca2+ ions as does SARS-1 FP, but the two Ca2+ binding sites of SARS-2 exhibit greater cooperativity. This Ca2+ dependence by the SARS-2 FP is very ion-specific. These results show that Ca2+ is an important regulator that interacts with the SARS-2 FP and thus plays a significant role in SARS-2 viral entry. This could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium interaction or block the Ca2+ channel.",Alex Liqi Lai; Jack H Freed,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425297,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425297,2021-01-04,2021-01-04,,False
444,"The SARS-CoV-2 antibody landscape is lower in magnitude for structural proteins, diversified for accessory proteins and stable long-term in children","BackgroundChildren are less clinically affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults with the majority of cases being mild or asymptomatic and the differences in infection outcomes are poorly understood. The kinetics, magnitude and landscape of the antibody response may impact the clinical severity and serological diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, a comprehensive investigation of the antibody landscape in children and adults is needed.

MethodsWe tested 254 plasma from 122 children with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Hong Kong up to 206 days post symptom onset, including 146 longitudinal samples from 58 children. Adult COVID-19 patients and pre-pandemic controls were included for comparison. We assessed antibodies to a 14-wide panel of SARS-CoV-2 structural and accessory proteins by Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS).

FindingsChildren have lower levels of Spike and Nucleocapsid antibodies than adults, and their cumulative humoral response is more expanded to accessory proteins (NSP1 and Open Reading Frames (ORFs)). Sensitive serology using the three N, ORF3b, ORF8 antibodies can discriminate COVID-19 in children. Principal component analysis revealed distinct serological signatures in children and the highest contribution to variance were responses to non-structural proteins ORF3b, NSP1, ORF7a and ORF8. Longitudinal sampling revealed maintenance or increase of antibodies for at least 6 months, except for ORF7b antibodies which showed decline. It was interesting to note that children have higher antibody responses towards known IFN antagonists: ORF3b, ORF6 and ORF7a.

We created a structure-based phylogenetic computational tool 3DPhyloFold to systematically identify structurally similar serine proteases with known therapeutic inhibitors and demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo.4,5 Several candidate compounds, Avoralstat, PCI-27483, Antipain, and Soybean-Trypsin-Inhibitor, inhibited TMPRSS2 in biochemical and cell infection assays.

446,The impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns accounting for antibody-dependent enhancement,"BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines are approved, vaccination campaigns are launched, and worldwide return to normality seems within close reach. Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines.

Methods and findingsWe introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and - importantly - some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications.

We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75% - 80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions.

ConclusionsWith the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next years flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.",Nessma Adil M.

447,Direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using high-contrast pH-sensitive dyes,"The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects on health, healthcare infrastructure, social structure, and economics. One of the limiting factors in containing the spread of this virus has been the lack of widespread availability of fast, inexpensive, and reliable methods for testing of individuals. Frequent screening for infected and often asymptomatic people is a cornerstone of pandemic management plans. Here, we introduce two pH sensitive  LAMPshade dyes as novel readouts in an isothermal RT-LAMP amplification assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The resulting JaneliaLAMP (jLAMP) assay is robust, simple, inexpensive, has low technical requirements and we describe its use and performance in direct testing of contrived and clinical samples without RNA extraction.",Timothy A Brown; Katherine S.

448,Paired heavy and light chain signatures contribute to potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in public antibody responses,"Understanding protective mechanisms of antibody recognition can inform vaccine and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We discovered a new antibody, 910-30, that targets the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor binding site as a member of a public antibody response encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 genes. We performed sequence and structural analyses to explore how antibody features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer revealed its binding interactions and ability to disassemble spike. Despite heavy chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies highlighted the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2 binding competition and for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We defined paired heavy:light sequence signatures and determined antibody precursor prevalence to be ~1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients. These data reveal key structural and functional neutralization features in the IGHV3-53/3-66 public antibody class to accelerate antibody-based medical interventions against SARS-CoV-2.

449,The functions of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing and infection-enhancing antibodies in vitro and in mice and nonhuman primates,"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) protect against COVID-19, making them a focus of vaccine design. A safety concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is whether they mediate disease enhancement. Here, we isolated potent NAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from individuals with acute or convalescent SARS-CoV-2 or a history of SARS-CoV-1 infection. Cryo-electron microscopy of RBD and NTD antibodies demonstrated function-specific modes of antibody binding. Select RBD NAbs also demonstrated Fc receptor-{gamma} (Fc{gamma}R)-mediated enhancement of virus infection in vitro, while five non-neutralizing NTD antibodies mediated Fc{gamma}R-independent in vitro infection enhancement. However, both in vitro neutralizing and infection-enhancing RBD or infection-enhancing NTD antibodies protected from SARS-CoV-2 challenge in non-human primates and mice. One of 30 monkeys infused with enhancing antibodies had lung pathology and bronchoalveolar lavage cytokine evidence suggestive of enhanced disease. Thus, these in vitro assessments of enhanced antibody-mediated infection do not necessarily indicate biologically relevant in vivo infection enhancement.",Dapeng Li; Robert J Edwards; Kartik Manne; David R Martinez; Alexandra Schafer; S Munir Alam; Kevin Wiehe; Xiaozhi Lu; Robert Parks; Laura L Sutherland; Thomas H Oguin III; Charlene McDanal; Lautaro G Perez; Katayoun Mansouri; Sophie M.

450,Sequencing of Sars-CoV-2 genome using different Nanopore chemistries,"Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a rapid and cost-efficient tool for diagnostic and epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study compared results from sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome using R9 vs R10 flow cells and Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK) vs Ligation Sequencing Kit (LSK). The R9 chemistry provided a lower error rate (3.5%) than R10 chemistry (7%). The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes few homopolymeric regions. Longest homopolymers were composed of 7 (TTTTTTT) and 6 (AAAAAA) nucleotides. The R10 chemistry resulted in a lower rate of deletions in timine and adenine homopolymeric regions than R9, at expenses of a larger rate (~10%) of mismatches in these regions.

The LSK had a larger yield than RBK, and provided longer reads than RBK. It also resulted in a larger percentage of aligned reads (99% vs 93%) and also in a complete consensus genome.

The results from this study suggest that the LSK used on a R9 flow cell could maximize the yield and accuracy of the consensus sequence when used in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for this pandemic has imposed a severe burden on the medical settings. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an important structural protein playing a key role in the viral entry. This protein is responsible for the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process. The recent reports of the appearance and spread of new SARS-CoV-2 strain has raised alarms. It was reported that this new variant containing the prominent active site mutation in the RBD (N501Y) was rapidly spreading within the population.

453,Rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on copper touch surfaces determined using a cell culture infectivity assay,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in China in 2019 and has transmitted rapidly around the world, currently responsible for 83 million reported cases and over 1.8 million deaths. The mode of transmission is believed principally to be airborne exposure to respiratory droplets from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients but there is also a risk of the droplets contaminating fomites such as touch surfaces including door handles, stair rails etc, leading to hand pick up and transfer to eyes, nose and mouth. We have previously shown that human coronavirus 229E survives for more than 5 days on inanimate surfaces and another laboratory reproduced this for SARS-CoV-2 this year. However, we showed rapid inactivation of Hu-CoV-229E within 10 minutes on different copper surfaces while the other laboratory indicated this took 4 hours for SARS-CoV-2. So why the difference? We have repeated our work with SARS-CoV-2 and can confirm that this coronavirus can be inactivated on copper surfaces in as little as 1 minute.

Excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines, known as a  cytokine storm are associated with high mortality rates especially in the elderly and in patients with age-related morbidities. Senescent cells, characterized by secretion of such cytokines (Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype - SASP), are known to occur in this context as well as upon a variety of stressogenic insults. Applying both: i) a novel ""in house"" antibody against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ii) a unique senescence detecting methodology, we identified for the first time in lung tissue from COVID-19 patients alveolar cells acquiring senescent features harboring also SARS-CoV-2.

This study explored Google search trends to understand public responses to COVID-19 concerns in Bangladesh.

MethodsWe used country-level Google search trends data to examine the association between Google search terms related to COVID-19 deaths, face masks, and COVID-19 vaccines and the actual and one-week lagged actual COVID-19 death counts from February 2, 2020, to December 19, 2020, in Bangladesh. Results: Search terms related to COVID-19 deaths, face masks, and COVID-19 vaccines increased and peaked during March and April, but then began declining gradually after June 2020. The mean relative search volume for face masks (35 points) was higher than for death information (8 points) and vaccines (16 points) throughout the study period, and searching for masks peaked (100 points) during the third week of March. Search interests for death information and face masks were negatively correlated with the actual and one-week lagged actual COVID-19 death counts.

456,Determinants of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19; a prospective cohort study from Pakistan,"A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Indus Hospital Karachi, Pakistan between March and June 2020 to describe the determinants of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 186 adult patients were enrolled and all-cause mortality was found to be 36% (67/186). Those who died were older and more likely to be males (p<0.05). Temperature and respiratory rate were higher among non-survivors while Oxygen saturation was lower (p<0.05). Serum CRP, D-dimer and IL-6 were higher while SpO2 was lower on admission among non-survivors (p<0.05). Non-survivors had higher SOFA and CURB-65 scores while thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and severe ARDS was more prevalent among them (p<0.05). Use of non-invasive ventilation in emergency room, ICU admission and invasive ventilation were associated with mortality in our cohort (p<0.05). Length of hospital stay and days of intubation were longer in non-survivors (p<0.05). Use of azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, tocilizumab, antibiotics, IVIG or anticoagulation showed no mortality benefit (p>0.05). Multivariable logistic regression showed that age > 60 years, oxygen saturation <93% on admission, pro-calcitonin > 2 ng/ml, unit rise in temperature and SOFA score, ICU admission and sepsis during hospital stay were associated with higher odds of mortality. Larger prospective studies are needed to further strengthen these findings.

457,Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions: when can the UK relax about COVID-19?,"The announcement of efficacious vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 has been met with worldwide acclaim and relief. Many countries already have detailed plans for vaccine targeting based on minimising severe illness, death and healthcare burdens. Normally, relatively simple relationships between epidemiological parameters, vaccine efficacy and vaccine uptake predict the success of any immunisation programme. However, the dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is made more complex by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection and the potential relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines. In this study we use an age-structured mathematical model, matched to a range of epidemiological data, to consider the interaction between the UK vaccination programme and future relaxation (or removal) of NPIs. Our predictions highlight the population-level risks of early relaxation leading to a pronounced wave of infections, and the individual-level risk relative to vaccine status. While the novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for this outbreak, this is highly contingent on the transmission blocking action of the vaccine and the population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored as vaccine programmes are rolled out in the UK and other countries.",Sam Moore; Edward M Hill; Michael Tildesley; Louise M Dyson; Matt J Keeling,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.20248896,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.20248896,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True

In this cohort study, we performed proteomic and laboratorial profiling of plasma from 163 patients admitted to Bauru State Hospital (Bauru, SP, Brazil) between May 4th and July 4th, 2020, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab samples. Plasma samples were collected upon admission for routine laboratory analyses and shotgun quantitative label-free proteomics. Based on the course of the disease, the patients were further divided into 3 groups: a) mild symptoms, discharged without admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (n=76); b) severe symptoms, discharged after admission to an ICU (n=56); c) critical, died after admission to an ICU (n=31). White cells and neutrophils were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. Lymphocytes were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild ones and platelets were significantly lower in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Ferritin, TGO, urea and creatinine were significantly higher in critical patients compared to mild and severe ones. Albumin, CPK, LDH and D-dimer were significantly higher in severe and critical patients compared to mild ones. PCR was significantly higher in severe patients compared to mild ones. Proteomic analysis revealed marked changes between the groups in plasma proteins related to complement activation, blood coagulation, antimicrobial humoral response, acute inflammatory response, and endopeptidase inhibitor activity. Higher levels of IREB2, GELS, POLR3D, PON1 and ULBP6 upon admission to hospital were found in patients with mild symptoms, while higher levels of Gal-10 were found in critical and severe patients.

All sequences were publicly available on the National Biotechnology Information Center (NCBI) platform. Using specific methodologies for paired FST, AMOVA, mismatch, demographic-spatial expansion, molecular diversity and for the time of evolutionary divergence, it was possible to notice that only 79 sites remained conserved and that the high number of polymorphisms found helped to establish a clear pattern of genetic non-structuring, based on the time of divergence between the groups.

462,A renewal equation model to assess roles andlimitations of contact tracing for diseaseoutbreak control,"We propose a deterministic model capturing essential features of contact tracing as part of public health non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate an outbreak of an infectious disease. By incorporating a mechanistic formulation of the processes at the individual level, we obtain an integral equation (delayed in calendar time and advanced in time since infection) for the probability that an infected individual is detected and isolated at any point in time. This is then coupled with a renewal equation for the total incidence to form a closed system describing the transmission dynamics involving contact tracing. We define and calculate basic and effective reproduction numbers in terms of pathogen characteristics and contact tracing implementation constraints. When applied to the case of SARS-CoV-2, our results show that only combinations of diagnosis of symptomatic infections and contact tracing that are almost perfect in terms of speed and coverage can attain control, unless additional measures to reduce overall community transmission are in place. Under constraints on the testing or tracing capacity, a temporary interruption of contact tracing may, depending on the overall growth rate and prevalence of the infection, lead to an irreversible loss of control even when the epidemic was previously contained.",Francesca Scarabel; Lorenzo Pellis; Nicholas H Ogden; Jianhong Wu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.20232934,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.20232934,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True

Health science students are the future frontliners to fight pandemics. Awareness and perception toward COVID-19 among health science students and staff at Kuwait University was assessed.

MethodsBetween June and July 2020, an online questionnaire was distributed to all students and staff at HCS. The questionnaire was divided into six sections: socio-demography, risk and awareness, preparedness and prevention, source of information, policies, and social stigma.

ResultsA total of 592 students and 162 staff completed the questionnaire. The prevalence of self-reported chronic condition among students and staff was 14.0% and 19.1%, respectively. Moreover, self-reported COVID-19 prevalence among students and staff was 2.7% and 1.2%, respectively. Interestingly, 54% of students and 38.3% of staff reported that they knew someone within their immediate social environment who have been/are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among students, 92.4% wore face mask in indoor places (outside of their home) often/all the time compared to wearing it outdoors (69.3%); whereas, for staff, it was more common to wear it outdoor than in indoor places (75.9% vs. 81.5%). Both students and staff showed greatest deal of trust was in official government press release and consultation with healthcare workers.

Willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine was indicated by 50% of students strongly agreed and an additional 25.8% agreed to taking it. Interest vaccine uptake was lower among staff (28.4% and 34.6% strongly agreed or agreed, respectively). Participants strongly agreed or agreed (72.5% and 19.6% of students as well as 68.5% and 22.2% of staff) that wearing face mask in public should be obligatory. More than 18% of students and staff indicated that they would avoid contact with COVID-19 infected people.

464,Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK Household Longitudinal Study,"BackgroundVaccination is crucial to address the COVID-19 pandemic but vaccine hesitancy could undermine control efforts. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK population, identify which population subgroups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant, and report stated reasons for vaccine hesitancy.

MethodsNationally representative survey data from 12,035 participants were collected from 24th November to 1st December 2020 for wave 6 of the  Understanding Society COVID-19 web survey. Participants were asked how likely or unlikely they would be to have a vaccine if offered and their main reason for hesitancy. Cross-sectional analysis assessed prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and logistic regression models conducted.

FindingsOverall intention to be vaccinated was high (82% likely/very likely). Vaccine hesitancy was higher in women (21.0% vs 14.7%), younger age groups (26.5% in 16-24 year olds vs 4.5% in 75+) and less educated (18.6% no qualifications vs 13.2% degree qualified). Vaccine hesitancy was particularly high in Black (71.8%), Pakistani/Bangladeshi (42.3%), Mixed (32.4%) and non-UK/Irish White (26.4%) ethnic groups. Fully adjusted models showed gender, education and ethnicity were independently associated with vaccine hesitancy. Odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy were 12.96 (95% CI:7.34, 22.89) in the Black/Black British and 2.31 (95% CI:1.55, 3.44) in Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic groups (compared to White British/Irish ethnicity) and 3.24 (95%CI:1.93, 5.45) for people with no qualifications compared to degree educated. The main reason for hesitancy was fears over unknown future effects.

InterpretationOlder people at greatest COVID-19 mortality risk expressed the greatest willingness to be vaccinated but Black and Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic groups had greater vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine programmes should prioritise measures to improve uptake in specific minority ethnic groups.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Embase and Medline up to November 16, 2020, using key words ""vaccine hesitancy"" and ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"". Vaccine hesitancy is complex but also context specific. Previous research about vaccine hesitancy relates to existing adult and childhood vaccines, with limited evidence currently available on willingness to be vaccinated for newly available COVID-19 vaccines. Existing vaccination programmes often have lower uptake among more socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Uptake of vaccines has often varied across ethnic groups, but patterns have often varied across different vaccine programmes.

Added value of this studyOur study describes the sub-groups of the UK population who are more likely to be hesitant about a COVID-19 vaccine and examines possible explanations for this. We used nationally representative data from the COVID-19 survey element of the UKs largest household panel study. We asked specifically about vaccine hesitancy in relation to a COVID-19 vaccine at a time when initial results of vaccine trials were being reported in the media. We found willingness to be vaccinated is generally high across the UK population but marked differences exist across population subgroups. Willingness to be vaccinated was greater in older age groups and in men. However, some minority ethnic groups, particularly Black/Black British and Pakistani/Bangladeshi, had high levels of vaccine hesitancy but this was not seen across all minority ethnic groups. People with lower education levels were also more likely to be vaccine hesitant.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe current evidence base on vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 is rapidly emerging but remains limited. Polling data has also found relatively high levels of willingness to take up a COVID-19 vaccine and suggested greater risks of vaccine hesitancy among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people. Our study suggests that the risk of vaccine hesitancy differs across minority ethnic groups considerably, with Black ethnic groups particularly likely to be vaccine hesitant within the UK. Some White minority ethnic groups are also more likely to be vaccine hesitant than White British/Irish people.

466,COVID-19 severity impacts on long-term neurological manifestation after hospitalisation,"BackgroundPreclinical and clinical investigations have argued for nervous system involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection and for long term sequalae including neurological manifestations

Methodsa sample of 208 previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 165 patients were re-assessed at 6 months according to a structured standardized clinical protocol. Premorbid comorbidities and clinical status, severity of COVID-19 disease, complications during and after hospitalization were recorded.

ResultsAt 6-month follow-up after hospitalisation due to COVID-19 disease, patients displayed a wide array of neurological symptoms, being fatigue (34%), memory/attention (31%), and sleep disorders (30%) the most frequent. Subjects reporting neurological symptoms were affected by more severe respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection parameters during hospitalisation. At neurological examination, 37.4% of patients exhibited neurological abnormalities, being cognitive deficits (17.5%), hyposmia (15.7%) and postural tremor (13.8%) the most common. Patients with cognitive deficits at follow-up were comparable for age, sex and pre-admission comorbidities but experienced worse respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection disease and longer hospitalisation.

467,Simulating the impacts of interregional mobility restriction on the spatial spread of COVID-19 in Japan,"This study develops a spatial Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model that analyzes the effect of interregional mobility on the spatial spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Japan. National and local governments have requested that residents refrain from traveling between 47 prefectures during the state of emergency. However, the extent to which restricting the interregional mobility prevents infection expansion has not been elucidated. Our spatial SEIR model describes the spatial spread pattern of COVID-19 when people commute to a prefecture where they work or study during the daytime and return to their residential prefecture at night. We assume that people are exposed to infection risk during their daytime activities. According to our simulation results, interregional mobility restriction can prevent geographical expansion of the infection. However, in prefectures with many infectious individuals, residents are exposed to higher infection risk when their mobility is restricted. Our simulation results also show that interregional mobility restriction plays a limited role in reducing the national total number of infected individuals.",Keisuke Kondo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248926,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248926,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True
468,The Ugandan Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Model: A Data Driven Approach to Estimate Risk,"ObjectivesThe first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified on March 21, 2020, in Uganda. The number of cases increased to 8,287 by September 30, 2020. By May throughout June, most of the cases were predominantly imported cases of truck drivers from neighbouring countries. Uganda responded with various restrictions and interventions including lockdown, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and use of face masks in public, to control the growth rate of the outbreak. By end of September 2020, Uganda had transitioned into community transmissions and most of the reported cases were locals contacts and alerts. This study assessed risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 in Uganda, and presents estimates of the reproduction ratio in real time. An optimal control analysis was performed to determine how long the current mitigation measures such as controlling the exposure in communities, rapid detection, confirmation and contact tracing, partial lockdown of the vulnerable groups and control at the porous boarders, could be implemented and at what cost.

MethodsThe daily confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Uganda were extracted from publicly available sources. Using the data, relative risks for age, gender, and geographical location were determined. Four approaches were used to forecast SARS-CoV-2 in Uganda namely linear exponential, nonlinear exponential, logistic and a deterministic model. The discrete logistic model and the next generation matrix method were used to estimate the effective reproduction number.

ResultsResults showed that women were at a higher risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 than the men, and the population attributable risk of SARS-CoV-2 to women was 42.22%. Most of the women affected by SARS-CoV-2 were likely contacts of cargo truck drivers at the boarders, where high infection rates were reported. Although most deaths in Uganda were in the age group of 60-69, the highest case fatality rate per 1000 was attributable the age group of 80-89, followed by 70-79. Geographically, Amuru had the highest relative risk compared to the national risk to SARS-CoV-2. For the case of mitigation scenarios, washing hands with 70% com pliance and regular hand washing of 6 times a day, was the most effective and sustainable to reduce SARS- CoV-2 exposure. This was followed by public wearing of face masks if at least 60% of the population complied, and physical distancing by 60% of the population. If schools, bars and churches were opened without compliance, i.e., no distancing, no handwashing and no public wearing of face masks, to mitigation measures, the highest incidence was observed, leading to a big replacement number. If mitigation measures are not followed by the population, then there will be high incidences and prevalence of the virus in the population.",Betty K Nannyonga; Henry Kyobe Bosa; Yonas Tegegn Wodermariam; Pontiano Kaleebu; John Ssenkusu; Tom Lutalo; Willford Kirungi; Fredrick Edward Makumbi; Vincent Aloysius Ssembatya; Henry G Mwebesa; Diana Atwine; Jane Ruth Aceng; Rhoda K Wanyenze,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248922,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248922,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True
469,The evaluation of a newly developed antigen test (QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag) for SARS-CoV-2: A prospective observational study in Japan,"IntroductionSeveral antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed worldwide, but their clinical utility has not been well established. In this study, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of QuickNavi-COVID19 Ag, a newly developed antigen test in Japan.

MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted at a PCR center between October 7 and December 5, 2020. The included patients were referred from a local public health center and 89 primary care facilities. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples with flocked swabs; one was used for the antigen test and the other for real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using the results of real-time RT-PCR as a reference, the performance of the antigen test was evaluated.

ResultsA total of 1186 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 105 (8.9%). Of these 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic. The antigen test provided a 98.8% (95% confident interval [CI]: 98.0%-99.4%) concordance rate with real-time RT-PCR, along with a sensitivity of 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%-92.5%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%). False-negatives were observed in 14 patients, 8 of whom were asymptomatic and had a low viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) >30). In symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 91.7% (95% CI: 82.7%-96.9%).

471,"Covid-19, Lockdowns and Motor Vehicle Collisions: Empirical Evidence from Greece","Reduced mobility during Covid-19 lockdowns means fewer vehicles at risk of collision, but also an opportunity to speed on empty streets. Other collision risk factors that have changed during the pandemic include alcohol consumption, sleeping patterns, distraction, unemployment and economic uncertainty. Evidence on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on motor vehicle collisions is scarce, as such statistics are often released with a delay. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of the first wave of the pandemic and the first lockdown on motor vehicle collisions and associated injuries and deaths in Greece. Using monthly data at the regional unit level, I provide descriptive evidence and subsequently follow a difference-in-difference econometric approach, comparing trends in 2020 to those of the previous five years while controlling for unemployment and petrol prices. I found a steep decline in collisions, injuries and deaths compared to what would have been otherwise expected. In March and April 2020, there were about 1,226 fewer collisions, 72 fewer deaths, 40 fewer serious injuries and 1,426 fewer minor injuries compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic.",Sotiris Vandoros,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.20248883,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.26.20248883,2021-01-02,2021-01-02,,True
472,"Non-medical COVID-19-related personal impact in medical ecological perspective: A global multileveled, mixed method study","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread public health measures to reduce transmission, morbidity, and mortality attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While much research and focus surrounds COVID-19 vaccine development, testing, and supportive management, little is known about the determinants of non-medical, personal impact of COVID-19 prevention policies. We aimed to understand determinants of non-medical COVID-19 impact and to account for its multileveled, intersectional nature of associations.

MethodsThis cross-sectional, multi-level, convergent mixed-methods study assessed a range of beliefs, practices, and experiences relating to COVID-19. We recruited a global sample (n=7,411) using both Facebook and Amazon mTURK platforms. We constructed a novel data-driven non-medical COVID-19 Impact Score and four subcomponents (""Personal Action,"" ""Supply-related,"" ""Cancellations,"" and ""Livelihood"" impacts). We used generalized estimating equation models with identity link functions to determine concomitant association of individual, household, and country-level variables on the impact scores. We also classified 20,015 qualitative excerpts from 6859 respondents using an 80-code codebook.

ResultsTotal and component impact scores varied significantly by region with Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean observing the highest impact scores. Multilevel modeling indicated that individual-level sociocultural variables accounted for much of this variation with COVID-related worry, knowledge, struggles in accessing food and supplies, and worsening mental health most strongly associated with non-medical impact. Family responsibilities, personal COVID medical experience, and health locus of control - in addition to country-level variables reflecting social and health challenge - were also significantly and independently associated with non-medical impact.

DiscussionNon-medical personal impact of COVID-19 affects most people internationally, largely in response to shutdowns, implementing prevention requirements, and through economic consequences. In the context where most of the worlds population does not have direct medical experience with COVID-19, this phenomena of non-medical impact is profound, and likely impacts sustainability of public health interventions aimed at containing COVID-19.",Timothy De Ver Dye; Brooke Levandowski; Shazia Siddiqi; Jose G.

473,MVA Vector Vaccines Inhibit SARS CoV-2 Replication in Upper and Lower Respiratory Tracts of Transgenic Mice and Prevent Lethal Disease,"Replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a licensed smallpox vaccine and numerous clinical studies investigating recombinant MVAs (rMVAs) as vectors for prevention of other infectious diseases have been completed or are in progress. Two rMVA COVID-19 vaccine trials are at an initial stage, though no animal protection studies have been reported. Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of CoV-2. Modifications of full length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected human cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and by soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced S-binding and pseudovirus-neutralizing antibodies. Boosting occurred following a second homologous rMVA but was higher with adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented recovery of infectious CoV-2 from the lungs. A low amount of virus was detected in the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later. Detection of subgenomic mRNA in turbinates on day 2 only indicated that replication was abortive in immunized animals.

SignificanceVaccines are required to control COVID-19 during the pandemic and possibly afterwards. Recombinant nucleic acids, proteins and virus vectors that stimulate immune responses to the CoV-2 S protein have provided protection in experimental animal or human clinical trials, though questions remain regarding their ability to prevent spread and the duration of immunity. The present study focuses on replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which has been shown to be a safe, immunogenic and stable smallpox vaccine and a promising vaccine vector for other infectious diseases and cancer. In a transgenic mouse model, one or two injections of recombinant MVAs that express modified forms of S inhibited CoV-2 replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and prevented severe disease.",Ruikang Liu; Jeffrey L Americo; Catherine A Cotter; Patricia L Earl; Noam Erez; Chen Peng; Bernard Moss,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424878,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424878,2021-01-01,2021-01-01,,False
474,The high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 is associated with increased interaction force between Spike-ACE2 caused by the viral N501Y mutation,"The Spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 mediates the viral particles binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells. Therefore, Spike-ACE2 interaction is a crucial determining factor for viral infectivity. A new phylogenetic group of SARS-CoV-2 (lineage B.1.1.7) has been recently identified in the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium dataset, which features an amino acid substitution in the Spike RBD (N501Y mutation). Infections with the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 have been overgrowing in recent weeks in the United Kingdom, indicating an even greater spread capacity than that seen with previous strains of the novel coronavirus. We hypothesized that this rapid spreading/infectivity of the B.1.1.7 lineage might be due to changes in the interaction force between the mutant Spike RBD and ACE2. This study employed in silico methods involving mutagenesis (N501Y mutation) and interface analysis focusing on the Spike RDB-ACE2 interaction. The results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutant (lineage B.1.1.7) establishes a more significant number of interactions relating to the mutant residue Y501 (Spike RDB) with residues Y41 and K353 (ACE2). This finding shows that the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is associated with the interaction force between the Spike RBD Y501 mutant residue with the ACE2 receptor, which in this strain is increased.",Jadson C Santos; Geraldo A Passos,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424708,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424708,2021-01-01,2021-01-01,,False
475,SARS-CoV-2 positivity in asymptomatic-screened dental patients,"Enhanced community surveillance is a key pillar of the public health response to COVID-19. Asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 is a potentially significant source of transmission, yet remains relatively poorly understood. Disruption of dental services continues with significantly reduced capacity. Ongoing precautions include pre- and/or at appointment COVID-19 symptom screening and use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). This study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental patients to inform community surveillance and improve understanding of risks in the dental setting. Thirty-one dental care centres across Scotland invited asymptomatic screened patients over 5-years-old to participate. Following verbal consent and completion of sociodemographic and symptom history questionnaire, trained dental teams took a combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab sample using standardised VTM-containing testkits. Samples were processed by the Lighthouse Lab and patients informed of their results by SMS/e-mail with appropriate self-isolation guidance in the event of a positive test. Over a 13-week period (from 3August to 31October2020) n=4,032 patients, largely representative of the population, were tested. Of these n=22 (0.5%; 95%CI 0.5%, 0.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rate increased over the period, commensurate with uptick in community prevalence identified across all national testing monitoring data streams. All positive cases were successfully followed up by the national contact tracing program. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a COVID-19 testing survey in asymptomatic-screened patients presenting in a dental setting. The positivity rate in this patient group reflects the underlying prevalence in community at the time. These data are a salient reminder, particularly when community infection levels are rising, of the importance of appropriate ongoing Infection Prevention Control and PPE vigilance, which is relevant as healthcare team fatigue increases as the pandemic continues.

Several public health and social protective measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of the COVID-19 were introduced. However, these measures are unfortunately neglected or deliberately ignored by some individuals.

ObjectiveTo identify the factors influencing intention to adhere to precautionary measures againstCOVID-19 in Sudan.

Methods and DesignCross sectional online based survey using virtual convenience sampling technique.

Variables MeasuredPerceived threat of corona virus (perceived severity and perceived susceptibility), perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy and intention to adhere to precautionary behavior towards COVID-19

ResultsThe significant predictors of intention to adhere to the precautionary behavior against COVID-19 were: gender ({beta} =3.34, P <0.001), self-efficacy ({beta}= 0.476, P<0.001), perceived benefits ({beta}= 0.349, P<0.001) and perceived severity ({beta}= 0.113, P=0.005). These factors explained 43% of the variance in participants intention to adhere to the protective measures. Participants who were female, confident in their ability to adhere to the protective measures when available, believing in the benefits of the protective measures against COVID-19 and perceiving that the disease could have serious consequences were more likely to be willing to adhere to the protective measures.

477,Meta-analysis of virus-induced host gene expression reveals unique signatures of immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2,"The clinical outcome of COVID-19 has an extreme age, genetic and comorbidity bias that is thought to be driven by an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease. The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on global health has resulted in multiple studies generating a variety of large gene expression datasets in a relatively short period of time. In order to better understand the immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2, we carried out a meta-analysis of these transcriptomics data available in the published literature. Datasets included both those available from SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines in vitro and those from patient samples. We focused our analysis on the identification of viral perturbed host functions as captured by co-expressed gene module analysis. Transcriptomics data from lung biopsies and nasopharyngeal samples, as opposed to those available from other clinical samples and infected cell lines, provided key signatures on the role of the hosts immune response on COVID-19 pathogenesis. For example, severity of infection and patients age are linked to the absence of stimulation of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, a known critical immediate line of defense against RNA viral infections that triggers type-I interferon responses. In addition, co-expression analysis of age-stratified transcriptional data provided evidence that signatures of key immune response pathways are perturbed in older COVID-19 patients. In particular, dysregulation of antigen-presenting components, down-regulation of cell cycle mechanisms and signatures of hyper-enriched monocytes were strongly correlated with the age of older individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.

478,In vitro Targeting of Transcription Factors to Control the Cytokine Release Syndrome in COVID-19,"Treatment of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has become an important part of rescuing hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Here, we systematically explored the transcriptional regulators of inflammatory cytokines involved in the COVID-19 CRS to identify candidate transcription factors (TFs) for therapeutic targeting using approved drugs. We integrated a resource of TF-cytokine gene interactions with single-cell RNA-seq expression data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells of COVID-19 patients. We found 581 significantly correlated interactions, between 95 TFs and 16 cytokines upregulated in the COVID-19 patients, that may contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. Among these, we identified 19 TFs that are targets of FDA approved drugs. We investigated the potential therapeutic effect of 10 drugs and 25 drug combinations on inflammatory cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which revealed two drugs that inhibited cytokine production and numerous combinations that show synergistic efficacy in downregulating cytokine production.

479,Pharmacophore-based peptide biologics neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S1 and deter S1-ACE2 interaction in vitro,"Effective therapeutics and stable vaccine are the urgent need of the day to combat COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a pivotal role in cell-entry and host immune response, thus regarded as potential drug- and vaccine-target. As the virus utilizes the S1 domain of spike to initiate cell-attachment and S2 domain for membrane fusion, several attempts have been made to design viral-receptor and viral-fusion blockers. Here, by deploying interactive structure-based design and pharmacophore-based approaches, we designed short and stable peptide-biologics i.e. CoV-spike-neutralizing peptides (CSNPs) including CSNP1, CSNP2, CSNP3, CSNP4. We could demonstrate in cell culture experiments that CSNP2 binds to S1 at submicromolar concentration and abrogates the S1-hACE2 interaction. CSNP3, a modified and downsized form of CSNP2, could neither interfere with the S1-hACE2 interaction nor bind to S1. CSNP4 exhibited dose-dependent binding to both S1 and hACE2 and abolished the S1-hACE2 interaction in vitro. CSNP4 possibly enhance the mAb-based S1 neutralization by limiting the spontaneous movement of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas CSNP2 allowed RBD-mAb binding without any steric hindrance. Taken together, we suggest that CSNP2 and CSNP4 are potent and stable candidate peptides that can neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike and possibly pose the virus to host immune surveillance.",Hyun Goo Woo; Masaud Shah; Sung Ung Moon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424801,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424801,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,False

The world urgently needs a cost-effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus vaccine, antiviral and therapeutic drugs to control the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we engineered the Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike protein (S) variants (Receptor binding domain, RBD and S1 domain) of SARS-CoV-2 genes and produced in Nicotiana benthamiana plant. The purification yields were at least 20 mg of pure protein/kg of plant biomass for each target protein. The S protein variants of SARS-CoV-2 showed specific binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. The purified plant produced N and S variants were recognized by N and S protein specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies demonstrating specific reactivity of mAb to plant produced N and S protein variants. In addition, IgG responses of plant produced N and S antigens elicited significantly high titers of antibody in mice. This is the first report demonstrating production of functional active S1 domain and Nucleocapsid protein of SARC-CoV-2 in plants. In addition, in this study, for the first time, we report the co-expression of RBD with N protein to produce a cocktail antigen of SARS-CoV-2, which elicited high-titer antibodies compared to RBD or N proteins. Thus, obtained data support that plant produced N and S antigens, developed in this study, are promising vaccine candidates against COVID-19.",Tarlan Mammedov; Damla Yuksel; Merve Ilgin; Irem Gurbuzaslan; Burcu Gulec; Gulshan Mammadova; Deniz Say; Gulnara Hasanova,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424779,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424779,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,False
481,A novel fermented Yi traditional medicine efficiently suppresses the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a worldwide epidemic, causing more than 80 million infections and more than 1.7 million deaths. The pandemic has led to the closure of enterprises and schools in many countries, resulting in serious disruption of the global economy and social activities. Remdesivir is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19, but the WHO declared that Remdesivir is almost ineffective against COVID-19. The research and development of vaccines has made great progress, but it will take at least several months for safe and effective vaccines to be widely used clinically. Clinical studies revealed that some Traditional Chinese Medicines, such as Lianhua Qingwen Capsule and Huoxiang Zhengqi Water, exhibited excellent therapeutic effect on COVID-19. However, until now, there is still no cure for COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find medicines that can effectively fight against the SARS-CoV-2. In this study, JIE BEN No. 10 (JB10), a fermentation broth produced by Yi traditional medicine fermentation technology, was explored for its anti-coronavirus activity. The in vitro data showed that JB10 could significantly suppresses the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 769.1 times dilution and a selection index of 42.68. Further studies indicated that JB10 had significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The analysis of active components suggested that JB10 contained a large amount of superoxide dismutase (SOD), flavones, polyphenols, crude polysaccharide, etc. which may explain the anti-coronavirus activity, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

482,Screening a library of FDA-approved and bioactive compounds for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as a major global health threat. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 80 million cases and 1.7 million deaths to date while the number of cases continues to rise. With limited therapeutic options, the identification of safe and effective therapeutics is urgently needed. The repurposing of known clinical compounds holds the potential for rapid identification of drugs effective against SARS-CoV-2. Here we utilized a library of FDA-approved and well-studied preclinical and clinical compounds to screen for antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in human pulmonary epithelial cells. We identified 13 compounds that exhibit potent antiviral activity across multiple orthogonal assays. Hits include known antivirals, compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, and compounds targeting host pathways such as kinases and proteases critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication. We identified seven compounds not previously reported to have activity against SARS-CoV-2, including B02, a human RAD51 inhibitor. We further demonstrated that B02 exhibits synergy with remdesivir, the only antiviral approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19, highlighting the potential for combination therapy.

Our ability to understand the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells within the lung, and of protective or dysfunctional immune responses to the virus, is critical to effectively treat these patients. Currently, our understanding of cell-cell interactions across different disease states, and how such interactions may drive pathogenic outcomes, is incomplete. Here, we developed a generalizable workflow for identifying cells that are differentially interacting across COVID-19 patients with distinct disease outcomes and use it to examine five public single-cell RNA-seq datasets with a total of 85 individual samples. By characterizing the cell-cell interaction patterns across epithelial and immune cells in lung tissues for patients with varying disease severity, we illustrate diverse communication patterns across individuals, and discover heterogeneous communication patterns among moderate and severe patients.

485,Development of a Multivariable Model for COVID-19 Risk Stratification Based on Gradient Boosting Decision Trees,"ImportancePopulation stratification of the adult population in Ontario, Canada by their risk of COVID-19 complications can support rapid pandemic response, resource allocation, and decision making.

ObjectiveTo develop and validate a multivariable model to predict risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 severity from routinely collected health records of the entire adult population of Ontario, Canada.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cohort study included 36,323 adult patients (age [&ge;] 18 years) from the province of Ontario, Canada, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction between February 2 and October 5, 2020, and followed up through November 5, 2020. Patients living in long-term care facilities were excluded from the analysis.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresRisk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was estimated via Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, and risk factor importance was examined via Shapley values.

ResultsThe study cohort included 36,323 patients with majority female sex (18,895 [52.02%]) and median (IQR) age of 45 (31-58) years. The cohort had a hospitalization rate of 7.11% (2,583 hospitalizations) with median (IQR) time to hospitalization of 1 (0-5) days, and a mortality rate of 2.49% (906 deaths) with median (IQR) time to death of 12 (6-27) days. In contrast to patients who were not hospitalized, those who were hospitalized had a higher median age (64 years vs 43 years, p-value < 0.001), majority male (56.25% vs 47.35%, p-value<0.001), and had a higher median [IQR] number of comorbidities (3 [2-6] vs 1 [0-3], p-value<0.001). Patients were randomly split into development (n=29,058, 80%) and held-out validation (n=7,265, 20%) cohorts. The final Gradient Boosting model was built using the XGBoost algorithm and achieved high discrimination (development cohort: mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across the five folds of 0.852; held-out validation cohort: 0.8475) as well as excellent calibration (R2=0.998, slope=1.01, intercept=-0.01). The patients who scored at the top 10% in the validation cohort captured 47.41% of the actual hospitalizations, whereas those scored at the top 30% captured 80.56%. Patients in the held-out validation cohort (n=7,265) with a score of at least 0.5 (n=2,149, 29.58%) had a 20.29% hospitalization rate (positive predictive value 20.29%) compared with 2.2% hospitalization rate for those with a score less than 0.5 (n=5,116, 70.42%; negative predictive value 97.8%). Aside from age, gender and number of comorbidities, the features that most contribute to model predictions were: history of abnormal blood levels of creatinine, neutrophils and leukocytes, geography and chronic kidney disease.

ConclusionsA risk stratification model has been developed and validated using unique, de-identified, and linked routinely collected health administrative data available in Ontario, Canada. The final XGBoost model showed a high discrimination rate, with the potential utility to stratify patients at risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. This model demonstrates that routinely collected health system data can be successfully leveraged as a proxy for the potential risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Specifically, past laboratory results and demographic factors provide a strong signal for identifying patients who are susceptible to complications. The model can support population risk stratification that informs patients protection most at risk for severe COVID-19 complications.",Jahir M Gutierrez; Maksims Volkovs; Tomi Poutanen; Tristan Watson; Laura Rosella,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248783,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248783,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,True
486,Unraveling COVID-19-related hospital costs: The impact of clinical and demographic conditions,"IntroductionAlthough patients clinical conditions were previously shown to be associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and outcomes, their impact on hospital costs is not known. The economic evaluation of COVID-19 admissions allows the assessment of hospital costs associated with the treatment of these patients, including the main cost components and costs driven by demographic and clinical conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the COVID-19 hospitalization-related costs and their association with clinical conditions.

MethodsProspective observational cohort study of the hospitalization costs of patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 30 and June 30, 2020, who were followed until discharge, death, or external transfer, using micro-costing methodology. The study was carried out in the Central Institute of the Hospital das Clinicas, affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which is the largest hospital complex in Latin America and was designated to exclusively admit COVID-19 patients during the pandemic response.

ResultsThe average cost of the 3,254 admissions (51.7% of which involved intensive care unit (ICU) stays) was US$12,637.42. Overhead cost was the main cost component, followed by daily fixed costs and drugs. Sex, age and underlying hypertension (US$14,746.77), diabetes (US$15,002.12), obesity (US$18,941.55), cancer (US$10,315.06), chronic renal failure (US$15,377.84), and rheumatic (US$17,764.61), hematologic (US$15,908.25) and neurologic diseases (US$15,257.95) were significantly associated with higher costs. Age >69 years, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19, comorbidities, the use of mechanical ventilation, dialysis, or surgery, and poor outcomes remained significantly associated with higher costs after model adjustment.

ConclusionKnowledge of COVID-19-associated hospital costs and their impact across different populations can aid in the development of a generalizable and comprehensive approach to hospital preparedness, decision-making and planning for future risk management. Determining the disease-associated costs is the first step in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of treatments and vaccination programs.

SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the COVID-19 hospitalization-related costs?

FindingsIn this prospective cohort that was carried out in a single reference quaternary center designated for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19, more than three thousand patients were included, and their costs of hospitalization were found to be directly related to the age and comorbidities. The costs were more than 50% higher in older patients, 10-24% higher in patients with comorbidities, and 24-200% higher when additional therapeutic procedures were required.

With the Retarded SEIRS model and this criterion, we can predict whether the Covid-19 will re-emerge. So far, a large number of researches that have been presented in scientific groups or communities have been based on the SIR or SEIR model.

488,S gene dropout patterns in SARS-CoV-2 tests suggest spread of the H69del/V70del mutation in the US.,"Recently, multiple novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to share the same deletion of amino acids H69 and V70 in the virus S gene. This includes strain B.1.1.7 / SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, which has been found to be more infectious than other strains of SARS-CoV-2, and its increasing presence has resulted in new lockdowns in and travel restrictions leaving the UK. Here, we analyze 2 million RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at Helix to identify the rate of S gene dropout, which has been recently shown to occur in tests from individuals infected with strains of SARS-CoV-2 that carry the H69del/V70del mutation. We observe a rise in S gene dropout in the US starting in early October, with 0.25% of our daily SARS-CoV-2-positive tests exhibiting this pattern during the first week. The rate of positive samples with S gene dropout has grown slowly over time, with last week exhibiting the highest level yet, at 0.5%. Focusing on the 14 states for which we have sufficient sample size to assess the frequency of this rare event (n>1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples), we see a recent expansion in the Eastern part of the US, concentrated in MA, OH, and FL. However, we cannot say from these data whether the S gene dropout samples we observe here represent the B.1.1.7. strain.

489,Smoking and SARS-CoV-2 Impair Dendritic Cells and Regulate DC-SIGN Expression in Tissues,"The current spreading novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and pathogenic. In this study, we screened the gene expression of three SARS-CoV-2 host receptors (ACE2, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN) and DC status in bulk and single cell transcriptomic datasets of upper airway, lung or blood of smokers, non-smokers and COVID-19 patients. We found smoking increased DC-SIGN gene expression and inhibited DC maturation and its ability of T cell stimulation. In COVID-19, DC-SIGN gene expression was interestingly decreased in lung DCs but increased in blood DCs. Strikingly, DCs shifted from cDCs to pDCs in COVID-19, but the shift was trapped in an immature stage (CD22+ or ANXA1+ DC) with MHCII downregulation in severe cases. This observation indicates that DCs in severe cases stimulate innate immune responses but fail to specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides insights into smoking effect on COVID-19 risk and the profound modulation of DC function in severe COVID-19.

490,The interplay between subcritical fluctuations and import: understanding COVID-19 epidemiology dynamics,"The effective reproduction ratio r(t) parameter of an epidemic, defined as the average number of secondary infected cases per infectious case in a population in the current state, including both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts, controls the transition between a sub-critical threshold regime (r(t) < 1) and a supercritical threshold regime r(t) > 1). While in sub-critical regimes, an index infected case will cause an outbreak that will die out sooner or later, with large fluctuations observed when approaching the epidemic threshold, the supercritical regimes leads to an exponential growths of infection.

The super- or sub-critical regime of an outbreak is often not distinguished when close to the epidemic threshold, but its behaviour is of major importance to understand the course of an epidemic and public health management of disease control. In a sub-critical parameter regime undetected infection, here called ""imported case"" or import, i.e. a susceptible individual becoming infected from outside the study area e.g., can either spark recurrent isolated outbreaks or keep the ongoing levels of infection, but cannot cause an exponential growths of infection. However, when the community transmission becomes super-critical, any index case or few ""imported cases"" will lead the epidemic to an exponential growths of infections, hence being distinguished from the sub-critical dynamics by a critical epidemic threshold in which large fluctuations occur in stochastic versions of the considered processes.

As a continuation of the COVID-19 Basque Modeling Task Force (BMTF), we now investigate the role of critical fluctuations and import in basic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological models on disease spreading dynamics. Without loss of generality, these simple models can be treated analytically and, when considering the mean field approximation of more complex underlying stochastic and eventually spatially extended or generalized network processes, results can be applied to more complex models used to describe the COVID-19 epidemics. In this paper, we explore possible features of the course of an epidemic, showing that the sub-critical regime can explain the dynamic behaviour of COVID-19 spreading in the Basque Country, with this theory supported by real data.",Nico Stollenwerk; Joseba Bidaurrazaga; Javier Mar; Irati Eguiguren; Nicole Cusimano; Maira Aguiar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248840,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248840,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,True
491,"Contact Tracing of COVID-19 in Karnataka, India: Superspreading and Determinants of Infectiousness and Symptomaticity","Brief AbstractWe analysed SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and contact tracing data from Karnataka, India up to 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of infectiousness and the tendency for superspreading (overdispersion), and evaluated potential determinants of infectiousness and symptomaticity in COVID-19 cases. Among 956 cases confirmed to be forward-traced, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all secondary cases, suggesting significant heterogeneity in individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in underlying number of contacts. Secondary attack rate was 3.6% among 16715 close contacts. Transmission was higher when index case was aged >18 years, or was symptomatic (adjusted risk ratio, aRR 3.63), or was lab-confirmed [&ge;]4 days after symptom onset (aRR 3.01). Probability of symptomatic infection increased with age, and symptomatic infectors were 8.16 times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. This could potentially cause a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission generations; further studies are suggested to confirm this. Mean serial interval was 5.4 days. Adding backward contact tracing and targeting control measures to curb super-spreading may be prudent. Due to low symptomaticity and infectivity, interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing transmission.

Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSIndia has experienced the second largest outbreak of COVID-19 globally, yet there is a paucity of studies analysing contact tracing data in the region. Such studies can elucidate essential transmission metrics which can help optimize disease control policies.

MethodsWe analysed contact tracing data collected under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme from Karnataka, India between 9 March and 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of disease transmission including the reproduction number (R), overdispersion (k), secondary attack rate (SAR), and serial interval. R and k were jointly estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We evaluated the effect of age and other factors on the risk of transmitting the infection, probability of asymptomatic infection, and mortality due to COVID-19.

FindingsUp to 21 July, we found 111 index cases that crossed the super-spreading threshold of [&ge;]8 secondary cases. R and k were most reliably estimated at R 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.91) and k 0.12 (0.11-0.15) for confirmed traced cases (n=956); and R 0.91 (0.72-1.15) and k 0.22 (0.17-0.27) from the three largest clusters (n=394). Among 956 confirmed traced cases, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all secondary cases. Among 16715 contacts, overall SAR was 3.6% (3.4-3.9) and symptomatic cases were more infectious than asymptomatic cases (SAR 7.7% vs 2.0%; aRR 3.63 [3.04-4.34]). As compared to infectors aged 19-44 years, children were less infectious (aRR 0.21 [0.07-0.66] for 0-5 years and 0.47 [0.32-0.68] for 6-18 years). Infectors who were confirmed [&ge;]4 days after symptom onset were associated with higher infectiousness (aRR 3.01 [2.11-4.31]). Probability of symptomatic infection increased with age, and symptomatic infectors were 8.16 (3.29-20.24) times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. Serial interval had a mean of 5.4 (4.4-6.4) days with a Weibull distribution. Overall case fatality rate was 2.5% (2.4-2.7) which increased with age.

ConclusionWe found significant heterogeneity in the individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in the underlying number of contacts. To strengthen contact tracing in over-dispersed outbreaks, testing and tracing delays should be minimised, retrospective contact tracing should be considered, and contact tracing performance metrics should be utilised. Targeted measures to reduce potential superspreading events should be implemented. Interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission owing to their low symptomaticity and infectivity. There is some evidence that symptomatic cases produce secondary cases that are more likely to be symptomatic themselves which may potentially cause a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission generations; further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

492,Genomic Diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 in Turkey and the Impact of Virus Genome Mutations on Clinical Outcomes,"COVID-19 is a viral respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Global efforts of genomic surveillance of the virus give chance to track the spread of the pandemic. Global emergence of some viral mutations called attention and various studies have been suggested about increased infectivity of the virus. Herein, we sequenced viral genomes isolated from 184 patients in Istanbul and analyzed clinical metadata for the investigation of any viral mutation which affects the disease course of the host. We did not detect any viral mutations affecting the disease outcome in our cohort. Besides, we observed intra-host mutations in 76% of the isolates. Insertion/deletion and stop-gain mutations are also significantly less common among intra-host variants compared to consensus viral genome mutations. Longitudinal genomic surveillance is essential for timely detection of any lineages that might affect clinical outcome, the performance of diagnostic assays, or even the immunological escape of the virus.",Ilker Karacan; Tugba Kizilboga Akgun; Nihat Bugra Agaoglu; Payam Zolfagharian; Mehtap Aydin; Gizem Alkurt; Jale Yildiz; Betsi Kose; Nisan Denizce Can; Ayse Serra Ozel; Nilsun Altunal; Arzu Irvem; Yasemin Kendir Demirkol; Ozlem Akgun Dogan; Levent Doganay; Gizem Dinler Doganay,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248851,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248851,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,True
493,Will Proton Pump Inhibitors Lead to a Higher Risk of COVID-19 Infection and Progression to Severe Disease? A Meta-analysis,"BackgroundPrevious researches on the association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) use and the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 have generated inconsistent findings. Therefore, this Meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the outcome in patients who take PPIs.

MethodsWe carried out a systematic search to identify potential studies until November 2020. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by fixed-effects or random-effects models according to the heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses and tests for publication bias were also performed.

ResultsEight articles with more than 268,683 subjects were included. PPI use was not associated with increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:3.16, 95%CI = 0.74-13.43, P=0.12) or mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.91, 95% CI=0.86-4.24, P=0.11). While it can add risk of severe disease (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.20-1.99, P<0.001;) and secondary infection (OR=4.33, 95% CI=2.57-7.29). No publication bias was detected.

ConclusionsPPI use is not associated with increased risk infection and may not change the mortality risk of COVID-19, but appeared to be associated with increased risk of progression to severe disease and secondary infection. However, more original studies to further clarify the relationship between PPI and COVID-19 are still urgently needed.",Cunye Yan; Yue Chen; Chenyu Sun; Mubashir Ayaz Ahmed; Chandur Bhan; Ce Cheng; Lei Hu; Zhichun Guo; Hongru Yang; Chenyu Cao; Ziwei Ji; Yue Yan; Yijing Zuo; Yiceng Sun; Yao Li; Qin Zhou,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248860,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248860,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,True
494,Staff to staff transmission as a driver of healthcare worker infections with COVID-19,"ObjectivesTo investigate the COVID-19 infections among staff at our institution and determine the interventions required to prevent subsequent staff infections.

DesignRetrospective cohort study

Participants and settingStaff working at a single tertiary referral hospital who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 between 25 January 2020 and 25 November 2020.

Main outcome measuresSource of COVID-19 infection.

ResultsOf 45 staff who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 19 were determined to be acquired at Austin Health. Fifteen (15/19; 79% [95% CI: 54-94%]) of these were identified through contact tracing and testing following exposures to other infected staff and were presumed to be staff-staff transmission, including 10 healthcare workers (HCWs) linked to a single ward that cared for COVID-19 patients. Investigation of the outbreak identified the staff tearoom as the likely location for transmission, with subsequent reduction in HCW infections and resolution of the outbreak following implementation of enhanced control measures in tearoom facilities. No HCW contacts (0/204; 0% [95% CI: 0-2%]) developed COVID-19 infection following exposure to unrecognised patients with COVID-19.

ConclusionsUnrecognised infections among staff may be a significant driver of HCW infections in healthcare settings.

495,Acceptable Performance of the Abbott ID NOW Among Symptomatic Individuals with Confirmed COVID-19,"INTRODUCTIONPoint of care diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, such as the ID NOW, have great potential to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The ID NOW is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals within the first 7 days of symptom onset for COVID-19 if tested within 1 hour of specimen collection. However, clinical data on the performance of the ID NOW is limited, with many studies deviating from the manufacturers instructions and/or having small sample size.

METHODSAdults with COVID-19 in the community or hospital were recruited into the study. Paired throat swabs were collected, with one throat swab transported immediately in an empty sterile tube to the laboratory for ID NOW testing, and the other transported in universal transport media and tested by an in-house SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay targeting the E-gene. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated.

RESULTS133 individuals were included in the study. 129 samples were positive on either the ID NOW and/or RT-PCR. Assuming any positive result on either assay represents a true positive, PPA of the ID NOW compared to RT-PCR with 95% confidence intervals was 89.1% [82.0% - 94.1%] and 91.6% [85.1% - 95.9%], respectively. When analyzing individuals with symptoms [&le;] 7 days and who had the ID NOW performed within an hour, ID NOW PPA increased to 98.2%.

496,Longitudinal variability in mortality predicts Covid-19 deaths,"Within Europe, death rates due to covid-19 vary greatly, with some countries being hardly hit while others to date are almost unaffected. It would be of interest to pinpoint the factors that determine a countrys susceptibility to a pandemic such as covid-19.

Here we present data demonstrating that mortality due to covid-19 in a given country could have been largely predicted even before the pandemic hit Europe, simply by looking at longitudinal variability of all-cause mortality rates in the years preceding the current outbreak. The variability in death rates during the influenza seasons of 2015-2019 correlate to excess mortality caused by covid-19 in 2020 (R2=0.48, p<0.0001). In contrast, we found no correlation between such excess mortality and age, population density, degree of urbanization, latitude, GNP, governmental health spendings or rates of influenza vaccinations.

These data may be of some relevance when discussing the effectiveness of acute measures in order to limit the spread of the disease and ultimately deaths. They suggest that in some European countries there is an intrinsic susceptibility to fatal respiratory viral disease including covid-19; a susceptibility that was evident long before the arrival of the current pandemic.",Jon O Lundberg; Hugo Zeberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248853,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.25.20248853,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,,True
497,Paired SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein Mutations Observed During Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 Viral Transfer from Humans to Minks and Back to Humans,"A mutation analysis of a collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes around the world via sequence, date, geographic location, and species has revealed a large number of variants from the initial reference sequence in Wuhan. It also reveals that humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have infected mink populations in the Netherlands, Denmark, United States, and Canada. In these animals, a small set of mutations often in combination, in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) has apparently transferred back into humans. The viral genomic mutations in minks observed in the Netherlands and Denmark show the potential for new mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD to be introduced into humans by zoonotic transfer. Our data suggests that close attention to viral transfer from humans to farm animals and pets will be required to prevent build-up of a viral reservoir for future zoonotic transfer.",Reid Rubsamen; Scott Burkholz; Suman Pokhrel; Benjamin R Kraemer; Daria Mochly-Rosen; Richard T Carback III; Tom Hodge; Paul Harris; Serban Ciotlos; Lu Wang; CV Herst,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424003,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424003,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
498,Deep mining of early antibody response in COVID-19 patients yields potent neutralisers and reveals high level of convergence,"Passive immunisation using monoclonal antibodies will play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. Until now, the majority of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody discovery efforts have relied on screening B cells of patients in the convalescent phase. Here, we describe deep-mining of the antibody repertoires of hospitalised COVID-19 patients using a combination of phage display technology and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing to isolate neutralising antibodies and gain insights into the early antibody response. This comprehensive discovery approach has yielded potent neutralising antibodies with distinct mechanisms of action, including the identification of a novel non-ACE2 receptor blocking antibody that is not expected to be affected by any of the major viral variants reported. The study highlighted the presence of potent neutralising antibodies with near germline sequences within both the IgG and IgM pools at early stages of infection.

The mechanisms that drive thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19 are poorly understood. Here, we report a role of the NETs/ Factor XII (FXII) axis for initiating procoagulant and proinflammatory reactions in COVID-19.

Proteomic analysis revealed enrichment of FXII in postmortem lung tissue from COVID-19 patients. Immunofluorescence analysis of COVID-19 lung tissue showed that FXII is activated in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vessel walls and in fibrin-rich alveolar spaces. In particular, activated FXII (FXIIa) colocalized with NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue, indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID-19. We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially caused by impaired NETs clearance via extracellular DNases. In contrast, addition of DNase I improved NETs clearance and reduced FXII activation in vitro. We propose that targeting both, FXIIa and the FXII activator NETs, is therapeutically effective in mitigating thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19.",Maike Frye; Hanna Englert; Chandini Rangaswamy; Carsten Deppermann; Jan-Peter Sperhake; Christoph Krisp; Danny Schreier; Emma Gordon; Sandra Konrath; Munif Haddad; Giordano Pula; Reiner Mailer; Hartmut Schlueter; Florian Langer; Klaus Pueschel; Kosta Panousis; Evi Stavrou; Coen Maas; Thomas Renne,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424644,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424644,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False

The polymerase enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 has proofreading functions, but still, the RNA viruses have a higher mutation rate than DNA viruses. The mutations in the viral genome provide a replication advantage in any population/geographical location and that may have profound consequences in the outcome and pathogenesis, diagnosis and patient management of the viral infection. In the present study, we have analysed full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, derived from symptomatic/asymptomatic COVID-19 patients from all six continents to investigate the common mutations globally. Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating independently, we identified total 313 mutations and some (21 mutations) of them are prevailing over time irrespective of geographical location. Another important finding, we are reporting here is, the mutation rate of the virus varies in different geographical locations suggesting the virus is adapting different strategies in the infected populations, having different genetic backgrounds across the globe. We have identified 11085TTT insertion (insertion of the Phenylalanine in NSP6 at position 38) mutation, which is mainly linked to the UK derived SARS-CoV-2 samples, we have also discovered non-sense mutation in ORF-8 after 17 amino acid is linked to the European and the USA derived SARS-CoV-2 samples.",Mohammad Khalid; Yousef Al-ebini; David Murphy; Maryam Shoai,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424530,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424530,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False

SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 64 million people worldwide, claimed over 1.4 million lives and is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We isolated a monoclonal antibody, termed B6, cross-reacting with eight {beta}-coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including all five human-infecting {beta}-coronaviruses, and broadly inhibiting entry of pseudotyped viruses from two coronavirus lineages. Cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography characterization reveal that B6 binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery and indicate that antibody binding sterically interferes with spike conformational changes leading to membrane fusion. Our data provide a structural framework explaining B6 cross-reactivity with {beta}-coronaviruses from three lineages along with proof-of-concept for antibody-mediated broad coronavirus neutralization elicited through vaccination.

502,SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved s2m element dimerizes via a kissing complex and interacts with host miRNA-1307-3p,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the necessity for a more fundamental understanding of the coronavirus life cycle. The causative agent of the disease, SARS-CoV-2, is being studied extensively from a structural standpoint in order to gain insight into key molecular mechanisms required for its survival. Contained within the untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are various conserved stem-loop elements that are believed to function in RNA replication, viral protein translation, and discontinuous transcription. While the majority of these regions are variable in sequence, a 41-nucleotide s2m element within the 3 UTR is highly conserved among coronaviruses and three other viral families. In this study, we demonstrate that the s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 dimerizes by forming an intermediate homodimeric kissing complex structure that is subsequently converted to a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation. This process is aided by the viral nucleocapsid protein, potentially indicating a role in mediating genome dimerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the s2m element interacts with multiple copies of host cellular miRNA-1307-3p.

Thus, to contain and study this variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is necessary to develop a specific molecular test to uniquely identify it. Using a completely automated pipeline involving deep learning techniques, we designed a primer set which is specific to SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 with >99% accuracy, starting from 8,923 sequences from GISAID. The resulting primer set is in the region of the synonymous mutation C16176T in the ORF1ab gene, using the canonical sequence of the variant B.1.1.7 as a reference. Further in-silico testing shows that the primer sets sequences do not appear in different viruses, using 20,571 virus samples from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), nor in other coronaviruses, using 487 samples from National Genomics Data Center (NGDC).

TMPRSS2 is an attractive target and has received significant attention for the development of drugs against SARS and MERS. Starting with comparative structural modeling and binding model analysis, we developed an efficient pharmacophore-based approach and applied in a large-scale in silico database screening for small molecule inhibitors against TMPRSS2.

505,LinearSampling: Linear-Time Stochastic Sampling of RNA Secondary Structure with Applications to SARS-CoV-2,"Many RNAs fold into multiple structures at equilibrium. The classical stochastic sampling algorithm can sample secondary structures according to their probabilities in the Boltzmann ensemble, and is widely used, e.g., for accessibility prediction. However, the current sampling algorithm, consisting of a bottom-up partition function phase followed by a top-down sampling phase, suffers from three limitations: (a) the formulation and implementation of the sampling phase are unnecessarily complicated; (b) much redundant work is repeatedly performed in the sampling phase; (c) the partition function runtime scales cubically with the sequence length. These issues prevent it from being used for full-length viral genomes such as SARS-CoV-2. To address these problems, we first present a hypergraph framework under which the sampling algorithm can be greatly simplified. We then present three sampling algorithms under this framework of which two eliminate redundant work in the sampling phase. Finally, we present LinearSampling, an end-to-end linear-time sampling algorithm that is orders of magnitude faster than the standard algorithm. For instance, LinearSampling is 111 x faster (48s vs. 1.5h) than Vienna RNAsubopt on the longest sequence in the RNAcentral dataset that RNAsubopt can run (15,780 nt). More importantly, LinearSampling is the first sampling algorithm to scale to the full genome of SARS-CoV-2, taking only 96 seconds on its reference sequence (29,903 nt). It finds 23 regions of 15 nt with high accessibilities, which can be potentially used for COVID-19 diagnostics and drug design.

506,Environmental Dependence of the Structure of the C-terminal Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Envelope Protein,"The SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E) is involved in a broad spectrum of functions in the cycle of the virus, including assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. To enable these activities, E is likely to be capable of changing its conformation depending on environmental cues. To investigate this issue, here we characterised the structural properties of the C-terminal domain of E (E-CTD), which has been reported to interact with host cell membranes. We first studied the conformation of the E-CTD in solution, finding characteristic features of a disordered protein. By contrast, in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles and micelles, which mimic cell membranes, the E-CTD was observed to become structured. The E-CTD was also found to display conformational changes with osmolytes. Furthermore, prolonged incubation of the E-CTD under physiological conditions resulted in amyloid-like fibril formation. Taken together, these findings indicate that the E-CTD can change its conformation depending on its environment, ranging from a disordered state, to a membrane-bound folded state, and an amyloid state. Our results thus provide insight into the structural basis of the role of E in the viral infection process.

508,SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 induces neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic. In addition to respiratory complications as a result of SARS-CoV-2 illness, accumulating evidence suggests that neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with the disease caused by the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulation on neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. Analyses of culture supernatants revealed an increase in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and iNOS/NO. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 increased protein expressions of phospho-p65 and phospho-I{kappa}B, as well as enhancing DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-{kappa}B. Pro-inflammatory effects of the glycoprotein effects were reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 (1 M). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 in BV-2 microglia increased the protein expression of NLRP3, as well as caspase-1 activity. However, pre-treatment with CRID3 (1 M) or BAY11-7082 (1 M) resulted in the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1. It was also observed that CRID3 attenuated SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increase in IL-1{beta} production. Increased protein expression of p38 MAPK was observed in BV-2 microglia stimulated with the spike glycoprotein S1, and was reduced in the presence of SKF 86002. These results have provided the first evidence demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. We propose that promotion of neuroinflammation by this glycoprotein is mediated through activation of NF-{kappa}B, NLRP3 inflammasome and p38 MAPK. These results are significant because of their relevance to our understanding of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",Olumayokun A Olajide; Victoria U Iwuanyanwu; Oyinkansola D Adegbola,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424619,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424619,2020-12-29,2020-12-29,,False
509,Landscapes and dynamic diversifications of B-cell receptor repertoires in COVID-19 patients,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Great international efforts have been put into the development of prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. However, the knowledge about the B cell immune response induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still limited. Here, we report a comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of immunoglobin heavy chain (IGH) repertoire in COVID-19 patients. By using next-generation sequencing technology, we examined the temporal changes in the landscape of the patients immunological status, and found dramatic changes in the IGH within the patients immune system after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Although different patients have distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, by employing clonotype overlap, lineage expansion and clonotype network analyses, we observed a higher clonotype overlap and substantial lineage expansion of B cell clones during 2-3 weeks of illness, which is of great importance to B-cell immune responses. Meanwhile, for preferences of V gene usage during SARS-CoV-2 infection, IGHV3-74 and IGHV4-34 and IGHV4-39 in COVID-19 patients were more abundant than that of healthy controls. Overall, we present an immunological resource for SARS-CoV-2 that could promote both therapeutic development as well as mechanistic research.",Haitao Xiang; Yingze Zhao; Xinyang Li; Peipei Liu; Longlong Wang; Meiniang Wang; Lei Tian; Haixi Sun; Wei Zhang; Ziqian Xu; Beiwei Ye; Xiaoju Yuan; Pengyan Wang; Ning Zhang; Yuhuan Gong; Chengrong Bian; Zhaohai Wang; Linxiang Yu; Jin Yan; Fanping Meng; Changqing Bai; Xiaoshan Wang; Xiaopan Liu; Kai Gao; Liang Wu; Longqi F.
