0,Evaluation of six commercial SARS-CoV-2 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent assays for clinical testing and serosurveillance.,"Background: Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 complements nucleic acid tests for patient diagnosis and enables monitoring of population susceptibility to inform the COVID-19 pandemic response. As we move into the era of vaccines, the detection of neutralising antibody will become increasingly important. Many serological tests have been developed under emergency use authorization, but their reliability remains unclear. Methods: We evaluated the performance of six commercially-available Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs), including a surrogate virus neutralization test, for detection of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG), total or neutralising antibodies and a subset of results were compared to microneutralisation. Results: For sera collected > 14 days post-symptom onset the Wantai total Ab performed best with highest sensitivity 100% (95% confidence interval: 94.6-100) followed by 93.1% for Euroimmun NCP-IgG, 93.1% for GenScript Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test, 90.3% for Euroimmun S1-IgG, 88.9% for Euroimmun S1-IgA and 83.3% for Wantai IgM. Specificity for the best performing assay was 99.5% and for the lowest 97.1%. Conclusion: Wantai ELISA, detecting total immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, had the best performance. Antibody target, timing and longevity of the immune response, and the objectives of testing should be considered in test choice. ELISAs should be used within a confirmatory testing algorithm to ensure reliable results. ELISAs provide high quality results, with flexibility for test numbers without the need for manufacturer specific analyzers.

1,SARS-CoV-2 recruits a haem metabolite to evade antibody immunity,"The coronaviral spike is the dominant viral antigen and the target of neutralizing antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of haem metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that the virus co-opts the haem metabolite for the evasion of humoral immunity via allosteric shielding of a sensitive epitope and demonstrate the remarkable structural plasticity of the NTD.",Annachiara Rosa; Valerie E Pye; Carl Graham; Luke Muir; Jeffrey Seow; Kevin W Ng; Nicola J Cook; Chloe Rees-Spear; Eleanor Parker; Mariana Silva dos Santos; Carolina Rosadas; Alberto Susana; Hefin Rhys; Andrea Nans; Laura Masino; Chloe Roustan; Evangelos Christodoulou; Rachel Ulferts; Antoni Wrobel; Charlotte-Eve Short; Michael Fertleman; Rogier W Sanders; Judith Heaney; Moira Spyer; Svend Kjaer; Andy Riddell; Michael H Malim; Rupert Beale; James I MacRae; Graham P Taylor; Eleni Nastouli; Marit J van Gils; Peter B Rosenthal; Massimo Pizzato; Myra O McClure; Richard S Tedder; George Kassiotis; Laura E McCoy; Katie J Doores; Peter Cherepanov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249203,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249203,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
2,Genomic insights into early SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in Reunion Island,"The relative isolation of many island communities provides some protection from the COVID-19 pandemic, as imported cases can be limited and traced effectively. Until recently, this was true for the population of the French overseas department, Reunion Island, where only limited numbers of autochthonous cases were observed prior to August 2020. Since the report of the first case of COVID-19, contact tracing has been carried out for each new case identified in Reunion Island to identify transmission and clusters. To contribute to the public health response and understand the diffusion of SARS-Cov-2 strains in Reunion Island, we established in-house genome sequencing capability in Reunion using Oxford nanopore technology (MinION) as an inexpensive option for genomic typing of SARS-CoV-2 lineages on the island, and cross-validated typing results between viral isolation methods and different sequencing technologies. The results of our work during the early phase of the epidemics are presented herein.",David A Wilkinson; Camille Lebarbenchon; Celestine Atyame; Sarah Hafsia; Marie-Christine Jaffar-Bandjee; Luce Menudier; Sebastien Tanaka; Olivier Meilhac; Patrick Mavingui,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249623,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249623,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
3,The usefulness of a quantitative olfactory test for the detection of COVID-19.,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, olfactory dysfunction (anosmia or hyposmia) has been reported by many patients and recognized as a prevalent and early symptom of infection. This finding has been associated with viral-induced olfactory neuron dysfunction rather than the nasal congestion typically found in cold- or flu-like states. In literature, the prevalence of anosmia varies from 15% to 85%, and the studies, in general, were based on the subjective evaluation of patients' self-reports of loss of smell (yes or no question). In the present study, we quantitatively evaluated olfactory dysfunction and the prevalence of fever in symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 using a scratch-and-sniff olfactory test and infrared temperature testing with Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) as the gold&-standard comparator method to diagnose COVID-19 infection. Methods: Outpatients had their forehead temperature checked with an infrared non-contact thermometer (temperature guns). After that, they received two olfactory smell identification test (SIT) cards (u-Smell-it ; CT, USA) that each had 5 scent windows and were asked to scratch with a pencil and sniff each of the 10 small circles containing the microencapsulated fragrances and mark the best option on a response card. Nasopharyngeal swabs were then collected for Reverse RT-PCR to determine if the patients were positive or negative for COVID-19 infection. We considered the number of 'hits' (correct answers) [&le;] 5 as positive for loss of smell (LOS) in the olfactory test; [&ge;] 6 hits was considered negative for LOS (i.e. normal olfactory function). All data were analyzed using Excel and Matlab software. Results: In the present study, 165 patients were eligible for the olfactory test and nasopharyngeal swab collection RT-PCR. Five patients were excluded because of inconclusive PCR results (n=2) and missing data (n=3). A total of 160 patients completed all the protocols. The RT-PCR positivity rate for COVID-19 was 27.5% (n=44), and PCR+ patients scored significantly worse in the olfactory test (5.5{+/-}3.5) compared to RT-PCR- patients (8.2{+/-}1.8, p<0.001). 0/44 PCR+ patients presented with a fever ([&ge;]37.8{degrees}C). In contrast an olfactory SIT had a specificity of 94.8% (95% CI, 89.1 - 98.1), sensitivity of 47.7% (95% CI, 32.7 - 63.3), accuracy of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.75 - 0.87), positive predictive value of 77.8% (95% CI, 59.6 - 88.8), negative predictive value of 82.7% (85% CI, 78.7 - 86.7), and odds ratio of 16.7. Conclusion: Our results suggest that temperature checking failed to detect COVID-19 infection, while an olfactory test may be useful to help identify COVID-19 infection in symptomatic patients.",Marcos Adriano Lessa; Stella M R Cotta-Pereira; Frederico A Ferreira; Terezinha Marta Pereira Pinto Castineira; Rafael de Mello Galiez; Debora Souza Faffe; Isabela de Carvalho Leitao; Diana Mariani; Erica Ramos dos Santos Nascimento; Flavia Soares Lessa; Isabela Brasil Succi; Carlos Eduardo Pedreira,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250173,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250173,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
4,Comparison study of commercial COVID-19 RT-PCR kits propose an approach to evaluate their performances,"With the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, scalable and high-throughput diagnostic testing is essential nationwide. Currently, RT-PCR has been the preferred method of viral detection and many manufacturers offer commercial kits for routine clinical diagnostics. In response to the incoming of various kits, there is a need to assess their performance and compatibility of use in clinical laboratories. Kit characteristics impact the testing workflow of these laboratories and some factors can render a kit to perform sub-optimally, leading to false results that are misleading for public safety. Here, we evaluated six commercial kits that are predominantly distributed to appointed testing facilities across Indonesia. Their performance was assessed based on their ease of use, availability, robustness and accuracy for scalable testing in a manual set-up. Our findings demonstrated that all six kits are suitable for use in routine diagnostics, but their considerations for use may vary according to different use-cases. To better guide considerations in procurement of kits, our study provided a systematic approach for laboratories to assess the performance of new incoming kits.",Hana Krismawati; Caroline Mahendra; Annabelle Hartanto; Muhammad Fajri Rokhmad; Semuel Sandi; Astrid Irwanto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250143,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250143,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
5,Model-driven mitigation measures for reopening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Reopening schools is an urgent priority as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on throughout much of the world. To explore the risks associated with returning to in-person learning and the value of mitigation measures in a school setting, we use the stochastic, network-based SEIRS+ epidemiological modeling platform to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. Because children and adolescents differ both in disease susceptibility and in patterns of social interaction, we use distinct models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for primary and secondary school settings. We find that a number of mitigation measures may prove useful, particularly when community prevalence is low. Student cohorting, in which students are divided into two separate populations that attend in-person classes on alternating schedules, can reduce both the likelihood and the size of outbreaks. Proactive testing of teachers and staff once or twice a week can help catch introductions early, before they spread widely through the school. Especially in secondary schools, once- or twice- weekly testing amongst students should also be considered to further reduce the likelihood of a large outbreak amongst the full population. Vaccinating teachers and staff protects these individuals and may also have a disproportionate protective effect on the outbreak potential in primary and secondary schools when vaccines block SARS-CoV-2 transmission in addition to symptoms. Other mitigation strategies, including mask-wearing, social distancing, and increased ventilation, remain a crucial component of any reopening plan.",Ryan Seamus McGee; Julian R. Homburger; Hannah E.

6,A 3D CNN Classification Model for Accurate Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 using Computed Tomography Images,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly around the world. As of August 25, 2020, 23.719 million people have been infected in many countries. The cu-mulative death toll exceeds 812,000. Early detection of COVID-19 is essential to provide patients with appropriate medical care and protect uninfected people. Leveraging a large computed tomography (CT) database from 1,112 patients provided by China Consortium of Chest CT Image Investiga-tion (CC-CCII), we investigated multiple solutions in detect-ing COVID-19 and distinguished it from other common pneumonia (CP) and normal controls. We also compared the performance of different models for complete and segmented CT slices. In particular, we studied the effects of CT-superimposition depths into volumes on the performance of our models. The results show that the optimal model can identify the COVID-19 slices with 99.76% accuracy (99.96% recall, 99.35% precision and 99.65% F1-score). The overall performance for three-way classification obtained 99.24% ac-curacy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9986. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves the highest accuracy and recall with the largest public available COVID-19 CT dataset. Our model can help radiologists and physicians perform rapid diagnosis, especially when the healthcare system is overloaded.",Yifan Li; Xuan Pei; Yandong Guo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249999,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249999,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
7,Data Driven High Resolution Modeling and Spatial Analyses of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the world with over 90 million infections to date, and currently many countries are fighting the second wave of infections. With neither sufficient vaccination capacity nor effective medication, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) remain the measure of choice. However, NPIs place a great burden on society, the mental health of individuals, and economics. Therefore the cost/benefit ratio must be carefully balanced and a target-oriented small-scale implementation of these NPIs could help achieve this balance. To this end, we introduce a modified SEIR-class compartment model and parametrize it locally for all 412 districts of Germany. The NPIs are modeled at district level by time varying contact rates. This high spatial resolution makes it possible to apply geostatistical methods to analyse the spatial patterns of the pandemic in Germany and to compare the results of different spatial resolutions. We find that the modified SEIR model can successfully be fitted to the COVID-19 cases in German districts, states, and also nationwide. We propose the correlation length as a further measure, besides the weekly incidence rates, to describe the current situation of the epidemic.",Lennart Sch&uumller; Justin M.

8,Management of conductive deafness from Otitis Media with Effusion (known as glue ear) in children using bone conduction headsets when grommet operations were unavailable during COVID-19.,"Background Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) causing hearing impairments affects ~1 in 10 children starting school in UK/ Europe. Studies showed children with OME hear better with bone conducting headsets. During COVID-19 we investigated whether children with deafness secondary OME, without access to audiology or grommet surgery, could be aided with bone conduction kits and the HearGlueEar app. Methods Starting July 2020, during COVID-19, children aged 3-11 years with OME and on a grommet waiting list were invited to a single arm, prospective study. They received the kit, instructions and HearGlueEar app by post. By 3 weeks parents were asked to charge and pair the devices, attend a remote consultation and complete an OMQ-14 questionnaire. Remote follow-up lasted 3 months. Outcomes: ability to use the equipment, complete the questionnaire about child hearing and behaviour before and with the equipment, declining grommet surgery or where deafness resolved, and give opinion about the intervention. Findings: 26 children enrolled. Families used the kit at home and school. Most found remote consultations positive and convenient. OMQ-14 responses were 90% positive. Three families continued with the headset to avoid grommets. Comments were - Other people have said, wow his speech is clearer. - He said over and over again, I can hear everybody, wow, wow, wow. - It is no exaggeration to say this has made an astronomical improvement to his quality of life.- She is getting on really well with the headphones - pairing them with the iPad at home is simply brilliant.

9,Rule of thumb in human intelligence for assessing the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan,"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak in Japan exhibited its third peak at the end of 2020. Mathematical modelling and developed AI cannot explain several peaks in a single year. Object: This study was conducted to evaluate a rule of thumb for prediction from past wave experiences. Method: We rescaled the number of newly infected patients as 100% at the peak and checked similarities among waves. Then we extrapolated the courses of the third and later waves. Results: Results show some similarity around the second and the third waves. Based on this similarity, we expected the bottom of the third wave will show 2131 newly positive patients including asymptomatic patients at around the end of February, 2021. Discussion and Conclusion: We can infer the course of the third wave from similarity with the second wave. Mathematical modelling has been unable to do it, even when AI was used for prediction.

10,Willingness to volunteer of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: Assessment at a tertiary care hospital in India,"Background and Objectives The involvement of medical students in strategies to control COVID-19 might be considered to cope with the shortage of healthcare workers. This study aims at assessing the level of knowledge about COVID-19, willingness to volunteer, potential areas of involvement and reasons for deterrence towards volunteering among medical students. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate medical students of a tertiary care teaching hospital in New Delhi. A web-based questionnaire was used to elicit demographic information, knowledge of COVID-19, willingness to volunteer and reasons for deterrence for working during COVID-19 pandemic and self-declared knowledge in six domains. Results A total of 292 students participated in the study with a mean (S.D.) age of 19.9(3.1) years. The mean (S.D.) knowledge score of COVID-19 was 6.9 (1.1) (maximum score 10). Knowledge score was significantly different among preclinical (6.5), paraclinical (7.18), and clinical groups (7.03). Almost three fourth (75.3%) participants were willing to volunteer in COVID-19 pandemic, though 67.8% had not received any training in emergency medicine or public health crisis management. Willingness to work was maximum in areas of social work and indirect patient care (62.3% each). Lack of personal protective equipment was cited as a highly deterrent factor for volunteering (62.7%) followed by fear of transmitting the infection to the family (45.9%), fear of causing harm to the patient (34.2%), and absence of treatment (22.2%). Interpretation & conclusions Majority of the students were willing to volunteer even though they had not received adequate training.

11,Role of FYVE and Coiled-Coil Domain Autophagy Adaptor 1 in severity of COVID-19 infection: from GWAS hit to therapeutic hypothesis,"Coronaviruses remodel intracellular membranes to form specialized viral replication compartments, such as double-membrane vesicles where viral RNA genome replication takes place. Understanding the factors affecting host response is instrumental to design of therapeutics to prevent or ameliorate the course of infection. As part of explorative tests in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection participating in ODYSSEY trial, we obtained samples for whole genome sequencing analysis as well as for viral genome sequencing. Based on our data, we confirm one of the strongest severity susceptibility locus thus far reported in association with severe COVID-19: 3p21.31 locus with lead variant rs73064425. We further examine the associated region. Interestingly based on LD analysis we report 3 coding mutations within one gene in the region of FYVE and Coiled-Coil Domain Autophagy Adaptor 1 (FYCO1). We specifically focus on the role of FYCO1 modifiers and gain-of-function variants. We report the associations between the region and clinical characteristics in this severe set of COVID-19 patients. We next analyzed expression profiles of FYCO1 across all 466 compounds tested. We selected only those results that showed a significant reduction of expression of FYCO1. The most significant candidate was indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory that could potentially downregulate FYCO1. We hypothesize that via its direct effects on efficiency of viral egress, it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of indomethacin and other compounds downregulating FYCO1 in COVID-19 infection and other strains of betacoronaviruses.",Sandra Paulina Smieszek; Mihael H Polymeropoulos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250070,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250070,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

We report a case of a prolonged persistence of viable SARS-CoV-2 associated with clinical relapses of COVID-19 in a lymphoma patient. Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by Real time-PCR (RT-PCR). On five positive nasopharyngeal swabs, we performed viral culture and next generation sequencing. We analysed the patient's adaptive and innate immunity to characterize T and NK cell subsets. Findings SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs samples remained positive with cycle threshold mean values of 22{+/-}1.3 for over 8 months. All five performed viral cultures were positive and genomic analysis confirmed a persistent infection with the same strain. Viremia resulted positive in three out of four COVID-19 clinical relapses and cleared each time after remdesivir treatment. T and NK cells dynamic was different in aviremic and viremic samples and no SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detected throughout the disease course. Interpretation In our patient, SARS-CoV-2 persisted with proven infectivity for over eight months. Viremia was associated with COVID-19 relapses and remdesivir treatment was effective in viremia clearance and symptoms remission, although it was unable to clear the virus from the upper respiratory airways. During the viremic phase, we observed a low frequency of terminal effector CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood that are probably recruited in inflammatory tissue for viral eradication. In addition we found a high level of NK cells repertoire perturbation with a relevant involvement during SARS-CoV-2 viremia.

13,Evaluation of a Commercial Culture-free Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus-2 and Comparison with an Anti-RBD ELISA Assay,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 surrogate neutralization assays that bypass the need for viral culture offer substantial advantages regarding throughput and cost. The cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit (Genscript) is the first such commercially available assay, detecting antibodies that block RBD/ACE-2 interaction. We aimed to evaluate cPass to inform its use and assess its added value compared to anti-RBD ELISA assays. Methods: Serum reference panels were used to compare cPass to plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and a pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay for detection of neutralizing antibodies. We assessed the correlation of cPass with an ELISA detecting anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies at a single timepoint and across intervals from onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Compared to PRNT-50%, cPass had 100% sensitivity (95%CI 82-100) and 95% specificity (76-100). Sensitivity was also very high compared to the pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay, but specificity was lower, ranging from 17-70%. Highest agreement between cPass and ELISA was for anti-RBD IgG (r=0.851 at 0-6 weeks; r=0.798 at > 6 weeks). Anti-RBD IgG diagnostic accuracy for detection of neutralizing antibodies was essentially identical to that of cPass.

14,Seroprevalence and attainment of herd immunity against SARS CoV-2: A modelling study,"Objective: The present study is aims to predict the likelihood of and likely time required to attain herd immunity against COVID-19 in New Delhi due to natural infection. Method: An ODE based mathematical model was constructed by extending the classical SEIR model to predict the seroprevalence rate in Delhi. We estimated the parameter values for Delhi using available data (reported cases and the seroprevalence rate) and used them for future prediction. We also attempted to capture the changes in the seroprevalence rate with different possibilities of reinfection. Results: Maximum seroprevalence rate obtained through our model is 31.65% and also a reduction in the seroprevalence rate was observed for the upcoming one month (month of January, 2021) due to the reduced transmission rate. After increasing the transmission rate to the value same as the third wave in New Delhi, we obtained a maximum value of 54.96%. This maximum value significantly decreased with the reduction in the reinfection possibilities. Also, a little impact of the duration of persistence of antibodies, 180 vs 105 days, was observed on the maximum seroprevalence. Conclusion: This modelling study suggests that natural infection alone, as gauged by serial sero-surveys, will not result in attainment of herd immunity in the state of Delhi.",Abhijit Paul; Harshith B Kadnur; Animesh Ray; Samrat Chatterjee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250328,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250328,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

16,Extraction of Viral Nucleic Acids with Carbon Nanotubes Increases SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Detection Sensitivity,"The global SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has led to a surging demand for rapid and efficient viral infection diagnostic tests, generating a supply shortage in diagnostic test consumables including nucleic acid extraction kits. Here, we develop a modular method for high-yield extraction of viral single-stranded nucleic acids by using capture ssDNA sequences attached to carbon nanotubes. Target SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA can be captured by ssDNA-nanotube constructs via hybridization and separated from the liquid phase in a single-tube system with minimal chemical reagents, for downstream quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection. This nanotube-based extraction method enables 100% extraction yield of target SARS-CoV-2 RNA from phosphate buffered saline in comparison to ~20% extraction yield when instead using a commercial silica-column kit. Notably, carbon nanotubes enable extraction of nucleic acids directly from 50% human saliva, bypassing the need for further biofluid purification and avoiding the use of DNA/RNA extraction kits. Carbon nanotube-based extraction of viral nucleic acids facilitates high-yield and high-sensitivity identification of viral nucleic acids such as the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome with reduced reliance on reagents affected by supply chain obstacles.",Sanghwa Jeong; Eduardo G Grandio; Nicole Navarro; Rebecca L Pinals; Francis Ledesma; Darwin Yang; Markita P Landry,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.20224675,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.20224675,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

18,Oral ulcers of COVID-19 patients: a scoping review protocol,"Objective: This scoping review aims to systematically identify the types, characteristics, and possible pathophysiologic etiologies of the oral ulcers that emerge in COVID-19 patients. Introduction: The oral cavity is a vulnerable niche for the most diverse microbial ecosystem in the human body; therefore, it presents a wide array of mucocutaneous complications that could indicate various acute and chronic conditions. The COVID-19-related oral conditions, including oral ulcers, had been widely debated as direct manifestations or indirect complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to a preliminary search of PROSPERO, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the JBI Evidence Synthesis, there is no published nor registered scoping review concerned with the oral ulcers of COVID-19 patients. Inclusion criteria: The review will include studies included COVID-19 patients whose infection had been confirmed by RT-PCR testing regardless of infection severity and clinical course. Only the studies that reported COVID-19 patients with oral ulcers. Methods: A three-phase search strategy will be carried out: an initial limited search, a full electronic search, and hand search using the reference lists of all included records. The main bibliographic databases of published literature will include MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, EMBASE via Ovid, and Scopus. All identified records will be managed using EndNote 9.2, and the titles and abstracts will be screened against the inclusion criteria before the full text of all potentially relevant studies will be examined.

20,Projected spread of COVID-19's second wave in South Africa under different levels of lockdown,"South Africa is currently experiencing a second wave of resurgence in COVID-19 infection. In this modelling study, we use a Bayesian compartmental model to project possible spread of the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa under various levels of lockdown restrictions. Our model suggests that strict lockdown restrictions will have to be in place up to the end of March 2021 before cases can drop to levels observed, in September to early November 2020, after the first wave. On the one hand, extended lockdown restrictions have negative consequences -- albeit effective, they are not sustainable over extended periods. On the other hand, short lockdown restrictions over a few weeks will not have a lasting effect on the spread of the disease. Lockdown restrictions need to be supplemented with increased rapid testing, palliative support for the vulnerable, and implementations of other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mask mandate. These multifaceted approaches could help keep cases under control until vaccines are widely available.",Elisha B Are; Caroline B Colijn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250308,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250308,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

In the midst of the COVID19 pandemic, this presents an opportunity for active cases to be introduced into a community. Prior to the Fall 2020 semester, Colorado State University researchers combined student home locations with recent case counts compiled by the New York Times to assign a probability to each individual of arriving with COVID19. These probabilities were combined to estimate that there would be 7.8 new cases among the on-campus population. Comprehensive testing of arriving students revealed 7 new cases, which validated the approach. The procedure was repeated to explore what could happen if students had returned to campus after Fall break. The estimate of 48 cases corroborated the University's early decision to transition to fully remote learning after break.",Alex Fout; Jude Bayham; Margaret J Gutilla; Bailey K Fosdick; Heather Pidcoke; Michael Kirby; Peter Jan van Leeuwen; Chuck Anderson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250120,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250120,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

23,Longevity of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in haemodialysis patients and protection against reinfection,"Background Patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) have had high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following infection, ICHD patients frequently develop serological evidence of infection, even with asymptomatic disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the durability and functionality of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in ICHD patients. Methods Three hundred and fifty-six ICHD patients were longitudinally screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and underwent routine PCR-testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Patients were screened for nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies. Patients who became seronegative at 6 months were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses. Results One hundred and twenty-nine (36.2%) patients had detectable antibody to anti-NP at Time 0, of which 127(98.4%) also had detectable anti-RBD. At 6 months, of 111 patients tested, 71(64.0%) and 97 (87.4%) remained anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive respectively, p<0.001. For patients who retained antibody, both anti-NP and anti-RBD levels reduced significantly after 6 months. Ten patients who were anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive at Time 0, had no detectable antibody at 6 months; of which 8 were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T cell responses. Independent of antibody status at 6 months, patients with serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at Time 0, were at significantly lower risk of being diagnosed with infection Conclusions ICHD patients mount durable immune responses 6 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, with <3% of patients showing no evidence of humoral or cellular immunity.

24,"Assessment of the knowledge, preferences and concern regarding the prospective COVID- 19 vaccine among adults residing in New Delhi, India-A cross-sectional study.","Background Understanding the perception and concerns of people about COVID-19 vaccine in developing and populous country like India will help in understanding demand for the vaccine and further tailoring out public health information and education activities before the launch of the vaccine. The study was carried out to assess the present state of knowledge people have about the probable vaccine for COVID-19, to know the preferences of respondents about this vaccine and to learn the expectations and apprehensions of people about features of this prospective COVID-19 vaccine residing in the capital city of India. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted amongst the residents of Delhi, India from July-October 2020. Both offline and online interview method was used to collect date from 513 participants representing various occupational strata. Data was collected on socio demographic variable, vaccine acceptance and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine. Results Among the study population 79.5% said they will take the vaccine while 8.8% said they were not going to take the vaccine and remaining 11.7% had not yet decided about it. Most of them(78.8%),believed that vaccine would be available to public next year but at the same time half(50.1%) of them believe that it may not be in sufficient amount for everyone to get. More than 50% were willing to pay for the vaccine and 72% felt vaccine should first be given to health workers and high risk group. Conclusion The following study has helped to understand the percentage of people who are hesitant to take the vaccine and also the concerns regarding the vaccine. Also since half of the population is willing to pay for the vaccine, a strategical approach considering the various economical classes of people could be applied in a developing country like India.",Farzana Islam; Rashmi Agarwalla; Meely Panda; Yasir Alvi; Vishal Singh; Arup Debroy; Arindam Ray; Amruta Vadnerkar; Shraddha Uttekar,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250164,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250164,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

26,CovidArray: a microarray-based assay with high sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs,"Background: A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused the current Covid-19 epidemic. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Under ideal conditions RT-qPCR Covid-19 assays have analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%. However, when the sample panel is enlarged including asymptomatic individuals, the sensitivity decreases and false-negative are reported. Moreover, RT-qPCR requires up to 3-6 hours with most of the time involved in RNA extraction from swab samples. Methods: We introduce CovidArray, a microarray-based assay, to detect SARS-CoV-2 markers N1 and N2 in the nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on solid phase hybridization of fluorescently labelled amplicons upon RNA extraction and reverse transcription. This approach combines the physical-optical properties of the silicon substrate with the surface chemistry used to coat the substrate to obtain a diagnostic tool of great sensitivity. Furthermore, we used an innovative approach, RNAGEM, to extract and purify viral RNA in less than 15 minutes. To validate the CovidArray results, we exploited the high sensitivity of the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) technique. Results: We correctly assigned 12 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analyzed by RT-qPCR. Thanks to the CovidArray sensitivity that matches that of the ddPCR, we were able to identify a false-negative sample. Conclusions: CovidArray is the first DNA microarray-based assay to detect viral genes in the swabs. Its high sensitivity and the innovative viral RNA extraction by RNAGEM allows to reduce both the amount of false negative results and the total analysis time to about 2 hours.",Francesco Damin; Silvia Galbiati; Stella Gagliardi; Cristina Cereda; Francesca Dragoni; Claudio Fenizia; Valeria Savasi; Laura Sola; Marcella Chiari,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250281,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250281,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True

Study DESIGN Single-center, open label, randomised controlled trial. SETTING Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, February 27 to March 27, 2020. PARTICIPANTS 204 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were randomised in to treatment group and control group, which was 102 patients each group. INTERVENTIONS In treatment group, Q-14 was administrated at 10g (granules), twice daily for 14 days and plus standard care. In control group, patients were given standard care alone for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The primary outcome was conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population. RESULTS Among 204 patients, 195 were analyzed according to the intention to treat principle. There were 149 patients (71 vs. 78 in treatment group and control group respectively) turning to negative via SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. No statistically significance showed in conversion time between treatment group and control group (FAS: Median (IQR): 10.00 (9.00-11.00) vs. 10.00 (9.00-11.00); Mean rank: 67.92 vs. 81.44; P=0.051.). Time to recovery of fever was shorter in treatment group as compared in control group. The disappearance rate of symptom in cough, fatigue, chest discomfort was significantly higher in treatment group. In chest computed tomography (Chest CT) examinations, overall evaluation of chest CT examination after treatment compared with baseline showed more patients improved in treatment group .There were no significant differences in the other outcomes. CONCLUSION Administration of Q-14 on standard care for COVID-19 was useful for improvement of symptoms (such as fever, cough, fatigue and chest discomfort), while did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. No serious adverse events were reported.

It has been shown, however, that both viral particles and antibodies against those particles are present in saliva, which is more accessible than both swabs and blood. We present methods for highly sensitive measurements of both viral RNA and serology from the same saliva sample. We developed an efficient saliva RNA extraction method and combined it with an ultrasensitive serology test based on Single Molecule Array (Simoa) technology. We apply our test to the saliva of patients who presented to the hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, some of whom tested positive with a conventional RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal swab test.

30,SARS-CoV-2 RNA screening in routine pathology specimens,"Virus detection methods are important to cope with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics. Apart from the lung, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple organs in severe cases. Less is known on organ tropism in patients developing mild or no symptoms, and some of such patients might be missed in symptom-indicated swab testing. Here we tested and validated several approaches and selected the most reliable RT-PCR protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients' routine diagnostic formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens available in pathology, to assess a) organ tropism in samples from COVID-19-positive patients, b) unrecognized cases in selected tissues from negative or not-tested patients during a pandemic peak, and c) retrospectively, pre-pandemic lung samples. We identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in four samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients, in two gastric biopsies, one colon resection, and one pleural effusion specimen, while all other specimens, particularly from patients with mild COVID-19 disease course, were negative. In the pandemic peak cohort, we identified one previously unrecognized COVID-19 case in tonsillectomy samples. All pre-pandemic lung samples were negative. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in FFPE pathology specimens can potentially improve surveillance of COVID-19, allow retrospective studies, and advance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 organ tropism and effects.",Saskia E von Stillfried; Sophia Villwock; Roman D Buelow; Sonja Djudjaj; Eva M Buhl; Angela Maurer; Nadina Ortiz-Bruechle; Peter Celec; Barbara M Klinkhammer; Dickson WL Wong; Claudio Cacchi; Till Braunschweig; Ruth Knuechel; Edgar Dahl; Peter Boor,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250082,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250082,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
31,"Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Brazil is the third country most affected by Covid-19 pandemic. In spite of this, viral evolution in municipality resolution is poorly understood in Brazil and it is crucial to understand the epidemiology of viral spread. We identified four main circulating lineages in Esteio (Southern Brazil) and their relationship with global, national and regional lineages using phylogenetics and phylodynamics inferences from 21 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We provided a comprehensive view of viral mutations from a time- and age-representative sampling from May to October 2020, in Esteio (RS, Brazil), highlighting two frequent mutations in Spike glycoprotein (D614G and V1176F), an emergent mutation (E484K) in Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) characteristic of the South African lineage B.1.351, and the adjacent replacement of 2 amino acids in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K and G204R). A significant viral diversity was evidenced with the identification of 80 different SNPs. The E484K replacement was found in two genomes (9.5%) from samples obtained in mid-October, which is to our best knowledge the earliest description of E484K harboring SARS-CoV-2 in South Brazil. This mutation identified in a small municipality from the RS state demonstrates that it was probably widely distributed in the Brazilian territory, but went unnoticed so far by the lack of genomic surveillance in Brazil. The introduction of E484K mutants shows temporal correlation with later increases in new cases in our state. Importantly, since it has been associated with immune evasion and enhanced interaction with hACE-2, lineages containing this substitution must be the subject of intense surveillance. Our date demonstrates multiple introductions of the most prevalent lineages (B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.248) and the major role of community transmission in viral spreading and the establishment of Brazilian lineages.

32,Magnitude and timing of the antiviral response determine SARS-CoV-2 replication early in infection,"The interferon response is a potent antiviral defense mechanism, but its effectiveness in host protection depends on its timing relative to viral replication. Here, we report viral replication and host response kinetics at the start of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using longitudinal patient nasopharyngeal samples and airway epithelial organoids, we found that SARS-CoV-2 initially replicated exponentially with a doubling time of ~6hr, and induced interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) with delayed kinetics relative to viral replication. Prior exposure to rhinovirus increased ISG levels at the start of SARS-CoV-2 infection and completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication. Conversely, inhibiting ISG induction abrogated interference by rhinovirus and increased SARS-CoV-2 replication rate. These results demonstrate the importance of initial interferon-mediated defenses in determining the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 can replicate and indicate that biological variables that alter the airway interferon response could profoundly impact SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.",Nagarjuna R.

33,Dynamic change and clinical relevance of post-infectious SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.,"Background: Although reports suggest that most individuals with COVID-19 develop detectable antibodies post infection, the kinetics, durability, and relative differences between IgM and IgG responses beyond the first few weeks after symptom onset remain poorly understood. Methods: Within a large, well-phenotyped, diverse, prospective cohort of subjects with and without SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed infection and historical controls derived from cohorts with high prevalence of viral coinfections and samples taken during prior flu seasons, we measured SARS-CoV-2 serological responses (both IgG and IgM) using commercially available assays. We calculated sensitivity and specificity, relationship with disease severity and mapped the kinetics of antibody responses over time using generalised additive models. Results: We analysed 1,001 samples from 752 subjects, 327 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (29.7% with severe disease) spanning a period of 90 days from symptom onset. Sensitivity was lower (44.1-47.1%) early (<10 days) after symptom onset but increased to >80% after 10 days. IgM positivity increased earlier than IgG-targeted assays but positivity peaked between day 32 and 38 post onset of symptoms and declined thereafter, a dynamic that was confirmed when antibody levels were analysed, with more rapid decline observed with IgM. Early (<10 days) IgM but not IgG levels were significantly higher in those who subsequently developed severe disease (signal / cut-off 4.20 (0.75-17.93) versus 1.07 (0.21-5.46), P=0.048).

34,A High-throughput Microsphere-based Immunoassay of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM Testing for COVID-19 Diagnostics,"The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 is rapidly expanding across the world. A positive result of antibody tests suggests that the individual has potentially been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, thus allowing to identify asymptomatic infections and determine the seroprevalence in a given population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly developed high throughput immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detection on the Luminex MAGPIX platform. Clinical agreement studies were performed in 42 COVID-19 patient serum samples and 162 negative donor serum/plasma samples. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 42.86% (95% CI: 9.90% to 81.59%), 71.43% (95% CI: 29.04% to 96.33%), and 28.57% (95% CI: 13.22% to 48.67%) for samples collected on 0-7 days, 8-14 days, and 2-8 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 97.53% (95% CI: 93.80% to 99.32%). There was no cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody.

35,Assessment of The Relationship of REMS and MEWS Scores with Prognosis in Patients Diagnosed with Covid-19 Admitted to the Emergency Department,"Aim: With the rapid and global increase in COVID-19 cases, it is becoming important to identify patients with a risk of mortality and patients that need hospitalization. The aim of this study is to try to predict the mortality rate of COVID patients admitted to the emergency department with rapid scoring systems such as REMS and MEWS and their clinical termination in the emergency department at the end of the first month. Method: We have designed this study to be a single-centered, prospective and an observational study. A total of 392 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, who were admitted to the emergency department in a 1-month period, were included in the study. REMS and MEWS scores were calculated for each case. Demographic data of patients, clinical outcomes such as discharge, service hospitalization, ICU hospitalization, and first-month mortality were analysed based on these scores. ROC curves were analysed to determine the cut-off value with the help of which REMS and MEWS scores can predict 1-month mortality and hospitalization. Results: Out of the 392 patients included in the study, the 43.4% (n=170) were female and 56.6% (n=222) were male. The average age of our patients was 48.98{+/-}19.49 years. The 1-month mortality rate of our patients was 4.3% (n=17). At the end of the first month, the mortality of patients with a comorbid disease was higher than those who did not (p<0.01). The average of the REMS score was higher in patients with an average mortality of (7.24{+/-}3.77) than in patients without it (2.87{+/-}3.09), and there was a statistically significant difference between them (p<0.01). Similarly, the average of the MEWS score was higher in patients with an average mortality of (2.76{+/-}1.86) than in patients without it (1.65{+/-}1.35), and there was a statistically significant difference (p<0.01). The REMS score of patients admitted to the service was higher than that of patients discharged (p<0.01). When the REMS score was determined as 3 cut-off value in ROC analysis, service hospitalization was 5 times higher in patients with a REMS score of 3 and above than in those who were discharged (OR: 1:5.022 95% CI: 3.088-8.168)). REMS and MEWS scores were also higher in ICU patients than in discharged patients (p<0.01). Conclusion: In predicting the 1-month mortality of ER patients diagnosed with COVID-19, REMS and MEWS scoring systems can be useful and guiding in determining the patients who need hospitalization for emergency physicians. The use of these scoring systems in emergency departments can help predict the clinical outcomes of patients at the time of the initial evaluation, and can also be a practical method of predicting the prognosis of the patients.",Behlul Bas; Mucahit Senturk; Tugce Nur Burnaz; Kubilay Timur; Asim Kalkan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250384,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250384,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
36,"Estimates of global SARS-CoV-2 infection exposure, infection morbidity, and infection mortality rates","We aimed to estimate, albeit crudely and provisionally, national, regional, and global proportions of respective populations that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to assess infection morbidity and mortality rates, factoring both documented and undocumented infections. The estimates were generated by applying mathematical models to 159 countries and territories. The percentage of the world population that has been infected as of 31 December 2020 was estimated at 12.56% (95% CI: 11.17-14.05%). It was lowest in the Western Pacific Region at 0.66% (95% CI: 0.59-0.75%) and highest in the Americas at 41.92% (95% CI: 37.95-46.09%). The global infection fatality rate was 10.73 (95% CI: 10.21-11.29) per 10,000 infections. Globally per 1,000 infections, the infection acute-care bed hospitalization rate was 19.22 (95% CI: 18.73-19.51), the infection ICU bed hospitalization rate was 4.14 (95% CI: 4.10-4.18), the infection severity rate was 6.27 (95% CI: 6.18-6.37), and the infection criticality rate was 2.26 (95% CI: 2.24-2.28). If left unchecked with no interventions, the pandemic would eventually cause 8.18 million (95% CI: 7.30-9.18) deaths, 163.67 million (95% CI: 148.12-179.51) acute-care hospitalizations, 33.01 million (95% CI: 30.52-35.70) ICU hospitalizations, 50.23 million (95% CI: 46.24-54.67) severe cases, and 17.62 million (95% CI: 16.36-18.97) critical cases.

37,SARS-CoV-2 Airborne Surveillance Using Non-Powered Cold Traps,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide challenge requiring efficient containment strategies. High-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing and legal restrictions are not effective in order to get the current outbreak under control. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with a higher transmissibility require efficient strategies for early detection and surveillance. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in aerosols collected by non-powered cold traps. SARS-CoV-2 spreading kinetics and indoor hotspots could be identified in isolation units and at public places within a high-endemic area. These included an outpatient endoscopy facility, a concert hall, and a shopping mall. Results: Indoor COVID-19 hotspots were found in non-ventilated areas and in zones that are predisposed to a buoyancy (chimney) effect. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those aerosols reached concentrations of 10^5 copies/mL. Extensive outdoor air ventilation reliably eliminated SARS-CoV-2 aerosol contamination. Conclusions: The method presented herein could predict SARS-CoV-2 indoor hotspots and may help to characterize SARS-CoV-2 spreading kinetics. Moreover, it can be used for the surveillance of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Due to low costs and easy handling, the procedure might enable efficient algorithms for COVID-19 prevention and screening.",Sven G.

38,High density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of subsequent COVID-19 hospitalisation: the UK Biobank study,"Introduction While unfavourable changes in High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol appear to be a consequence of COVID-19, the reverse has been little-studied. Our objective was to test whether HDL-cholesterol within the normal range is associated with subsequent COVID-19 hospitalisation. Design We examined 317,306 participants in the prospective UK Biobank study with complete data on HDL-cholesterol and covariates at baseline (2006-2010). Follow-up for COVID-19 status was via hospitalisation records in England (16th March and 31st May 2020). Death certificates for the period 1st March to 30th September 2020 with an underlying cause denoted as COVID-19 (emergency ICD-10 code U07.1) were also utilised. Results Lower COVID-19 hospitalisation risk was apparent in people with higher level of HDL-cholesterol, adjusting for factors including health behaviours, inflammatory markers, and socio-economic status. The association appeared to be linear so that for each 0.2 mmol/L increase in HDL cholesterol, the odds ratio for COVID-19 hospitalisation was 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 0.86, 0.96). A similar pattern of association was apparent when deaths from COVID-19 was the outcome of interest. Conclusions Adequately high levels of HDL-cholesterol are associated with a lower risk of severe COVID-19.",Camille Lassale; Mark Hamer; Alvaro Hernaez; Catharine R Gale; George David Batty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250152,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250152,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
39,Contact patterns before and during the UK's Autumn 2020 COVID-19 lockdown among university students and staff,"Introduction Contact patterns are an important determinant of infection transmission. CONQUEST (COroNavirus QUESTionnaire) is an online survey of contacts for University of Bristol (UoB) staff and students. Results from 23/06/2020-24/11/2020 are used to investigate contact patterns among staff/students throughout various UK COVID-19 guidance periods. Methods Responses captured self-reported contacts on the previous day, with COVID-19 guidance periods split: post-first lockdown (23/06/2020-03/07/2020), relaxed guidance period (04/07/2020-13/09/2020), ""rule-of-six"" period (14/09/2020-04/11/2020), and the second lockdown (05/11/2020-25/11/2020). Results 722 staff (4199 responses) (mean household size: 2.6) and 738 students (1906 responses) (mean household size: 4.5) were included in the study. For staff, median contacts on the previous day were higher in the relaxed guidance and ""rule-of-six"" periods (3) than the post-lockdown and second lockdown periods (2). Mean contacts were higher during these two middle periods (4-6 per week) than the post-lockdown and second lockdown periods (~3). Mean contacts dropped between the last two periods (5.4 to 3.3), driven by a mean reduction in contacts in non-home/university locations (2.9 to 1.2). Few students responded until October. After 05/10/2020, the median was 2 and the mean was around 6-7 each week, until the second lockdown when it dropped to ~4. Mean number of contacts dropped between the last two periods (6.3 to 4.0) driven by a reduction in all contact types, including UoB contacts (3.5 to 2.5). Discussion The mean and median number of contacts for UoB staff and students were low compared to pre-COVID-19 studies throughout the survey period and lowest during the second lockdown.",Adam Trickey; Emily J Nixon; Hannah Christensen; Adam Finn; Amy C Thomas; Caroline Relton; Clara Montgomery; Gibran Hemani; Jane Metz; Josephine G Walker; Katy Turner; Rachel Kwiatkowska; Sarah Sauchelli; Leon Danon; Ellen Brooks-Pollock,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250097,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250097,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
40,"Integrating Operant and Cognitive Behavioral Economics to Inform Infectious Disease Response: Prevention, Testing, and Vaccination in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The role of human behavior to thwart transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19 is evident. Yet, many areas of psychological and behavioral science are limited in the ability to mobilize to address exponential spread or provide easily translatable findings for policymakers. Here we describe how integrating methods from operant and cognitive approaches to behavioral economics can provide robust policy relevant data. Adapting well validated methods from behavioral economic discounting and demand frameworks, we evaluate in four crowdsourced samples (total N = 1,366) behavioral mechanisms underlying engagement in preventive health behaviors. We find that people are more likely to social distance when specified activities are framed as high risk, that describing delay until testing (rather than delay until results) increases testing likelihood, and that framing vaccine safety in a positive valence improves vaccine acceptance. These findings collectively emphasize the flexibility of methods from diverse areas of behavioral science for informing public health crisis management.",Justin C Strickland; Derek D Reed; Steven R Hursh; Lindsay P Schwartz; Rachel NS Foster; Brett W Gelino; Robert S LeComte; Fernanda S Oda; Tadd D Schneider; Lauren Dayton; Carl Latkin; Matthew Johnson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250195,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250195,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,True
41,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Inpatient Rehabilitation and the Original Infection Control Measures for Rehabilitation Team,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on inpatient rehabilitation, and to determine the effectiveness of the original infection control measures implemented for the rehabilitation team. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, we calculated multiple rehabilitation indices of patients discharged from our rehabilitation ward between February 28 and May 25, 2020 when Hokkaido was initially affected by COVID-19, and compared them with those calculated during the same period in 2019. The Fisher exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. We also verified the impact of implementing the original infection control measures for the rehabilitation team on preventing nosocomial infections. Results: A total of 93 patients (47 of 2020 group, 46 of 2019 group) were included. The median age was 87 and 88 years, respectively, with no differences in age, sex, and main disease between the groups. Training time per day in the ward in 2020 was significantly lower than that in 2019 (p = 0.013). No significant differences were found in the qualitative evaluation indices of Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score at admission, FIM gain, length of ward stay, FIM efficiency, and rate of discharge to home. None of the patients or staff members had confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. Conclusions: Early COVID-19 pandemic in Hokkaido affected the quantitative index for inpatient rehabilitation but not the qualitative indices.

42,"Pervasive transmission of E484K and emergence of VUI-NP13L with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection events by two different lineages in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages are under the spotlight of the media, scientific community and governments. Recent reports of novel variants in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil (B.1.1.28-E484K) have raised intense interest because of a possible higher transmission rate or resistance to the novel vaccines. Nevertheless, the spread of B.1.1.28 (E484K) and other variants in Brazil is still unknown. In this work, we investigated the population structure and genomic complexity of SARS-CoV-2 in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state in Brazil. Most samples sequenced belonged to the B.1.1.28 (E484K) lineage, demonstrating its widespread dispersion. We were the first to identify two independent events of co-infection caused by the occurrence of B.1.1.28 (E484K) with either B.1.1.248 or B.1.91 lineages. Also, clustering analysis revealed the occurrence of a novel cluster of samples circulating in the state (named VUI-NP13L) characterized by 12 lineage-defining mutations. In light of the evidence for E484K dispersion, co-infection and emergence of VUI-NP13L in Rio Grande do Sul, we reaffirm the importance of establishing strict and effective social distancing measures to counter the spread of potentially more hazardous SARS-CoV-2 strains.",Ronaldo da Silva Francisco Junior; L.

43,mRNA-1273 vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies against spike mutants from global SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative infection of a global pandemic that has led to more than 2 million deaths worldwide. The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine has demonstrated ~94% efficacy in a Phase 3 study and has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of human sera from clinical trial participants in VSV PsVN assay using D614G spike was 1/1852. VSV pseudoviruses with spike containing K417N-E484K-N501Y-D614G and full B.1.351 mutations resulted in 2.7 and 6.4-fold GMT reduction, respectively, when compared to the D614G VSV pseudovirus. Importantly, the VSV PsVN GMT of these human sera to the full B.1.351 spike variant was still 1/290, with all evaluated sera able to fully neutralize. Similarly, sera from NHPs immunized with 30 or 100g of mRNA-1273 had VSV PsVN GMTs of ~ 1/323 or 1/404, respectively, against the full B.1.351 spike variant with a ~ 5 to 10-fold reduction compared to D614G. Individual mutations that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had a similar impact on neutralization when tested in VSV or in lentivirus PsVN assays. Despite the observed decreases, the GMT of VSV PsVN titers in human vaccinee sera against the B.1.351 variant remained at ~1/300. Taken together these data demonstrate reduced but still significant neutralization against the full B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427948,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427948,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
44,An effect of the COVID-19 pandemic: significantly more complicated appendicitis due to delayed presentation of patients!,"AIMS OF THE STUDY: The novel coronavirus pandemic has affected emergency department consultations for surgical pathologies. The aim of our study was to compare the number of acute appendicitis cases and the proportion of complicated appendicitis before and during the COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all data collected from a multicenter database of patients presenting to the emergency department for acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 12 to June 6, 2020, and compared these data with those from the same periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of acute appendicitis cases, proportion of complicated appendicitis, and pre and postoperative patient characteristics were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in this evaluation. Sixtyfive patients presented during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (group A), and 241 patients in previous years (group B: 2017 to 2019). The number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased by almost 20 percent during the pandemic compared with previous periods, with a significant increase in complicated appendicitis (52% in group A versus 20% in group B, p < 0,001.). Comparing the two groups, significant differences were also noted in the duration of symptoms ( symptoms > 48h in 61% and 26% , p < 0,001), the intervention time ( 77 vs 61 minutes, p = 0,002), length of hospital stay ( hospitalization of > 2 days in 63% and 32%, p < 0.001) and duration of antibiotic treatment ( antibiotics > 3 days in 36% and 24% p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID 19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of consultations for acute appendicitis, with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, most likely due to patient delay in consulting the emergency department at symptom onset.

45,Mask adherence and rate of COVID-19 across the United States,"Mask wearing has been advocated by public health officials as a way to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In the United States, policies on mask wearing have varied from state to state over the course of the pandemic. Even as more and more government leaders encourage or even mandate mask wearing, many citizens still resist the notion. Our research examines mask-wearing policy and adherence in association with COVID-19 case rates. We used state-level data on mask-wearing policy for the general public and on proportion of residents who stated they always wear masks in public. For all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), these data were abstracted by month for April[boxh]September 2020 to measure their impact on COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month (May[boxh]October 2020). Monthly COVID-19 case rates (number of cases per capita over two weeks) >200 per 100,000 residents were considered high. Fourteen of the 15 states with no mask-wearing policy for the general public reported a high COVID-19 rate. Of the 8 states with at least 75% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, independent of mask policy or demographic factors. Our analysis suggests high adherence to mask wearing could be a key factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19. This association between high mask adherence and reduced COVID-19 rates should influence policy makers and public health officials to focus on ways to improve mask adherence across the population in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.",Charlie B Fischer; Nedghie Adrien; Jeremiah J Silguero; Julianne J Hopper; Abir I Chowdhury; Martha M Werler,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250029,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250029,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
46,"Association between clinical characteristics and laboratory findings with outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a report from northeast of Iran","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first discovered in December 2019 in China and has rapidly spread worldwide. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and their association with the outcome of patients with COVID-19 can be decisive in management and early diagnosis. Data were obtained retrospectively from medical records of 397 hospitalized COVID-19 patients between February and May 2020 in Imam Reza hospital, northeast of Iran. Clinical and laboratory features were evaluated among survivors and non-survivors. The correlation between variables and duration of hospitalization and admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was determined. Male sex, age, hospitalization duration, and admission to ICU were significantly related to mortality rate. Headache was a more common feature in patients who survived (p = 0.017). It was also related to a shorter stay in the hospital (p = 0.032) as opposed to patients who experienced chest pain (p = 0.033). Decreased levels of consciousness and dyspnea were statistically more frequent in non-survivors (p = 0.003 and p = 0.011, respectively). Baseline white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in non-survivors (p < 0.001). Patients with higher WBC and CRP levels were more likely to be admitted to ICU (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively). Evaluating clinical and laboratory features can help clinicians find ways for risk stratifying patients and even make predictive tools.

47,Harnessing testing strategies and public health measures to avert COVID-19 outbreaks during ocean cruises,"To ensure the safe operation of schools, workplaces, nursing homes, and other businesses during COVID-19 pandemic there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective public health strategies. Here we focus on the cruise industry which was hit early by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 40 cruise ships reporting COVID-19 infections. We apply mathematical modeling to assess the impact of testing strategies together with social distancing protocols on the spread of the novel coronavirus during ocean cruises using an individual-level stochastic model of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We model the contact network, the potential importation of cases arising during shore excursions, the temporal course of infectivity at the individual level, the effects of social distancing strategies, different testing scenarios characterized by the tests sensitivity profile, and the testing frequency. Our findings indicate that PCR testing at embarkation and daily testing of all individuals aboard, together with increased social distancing and other public health measures, should allow for rapid detection and isolation of COVID-19 infections and dramatically reducing the probability of onboard COVID-19 community spread. In contrast, relying only on PCR testing at embarkation would not be sufficient to avert outbreaks, even when implementing substantial levels of social distancing measures.",Gerardo Chowell; Sushma Dahal; Raquel Bono; Kenji Mizumoto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250408,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250408,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
48,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by rapid antigen test in comparison with RT-PCR in a public setting,"Background: Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential in limiting the spread of infection during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD BIOSENSOR) by comparison with RT-PCR in a public setting. Method: Individuals aged 18 years or older who had booked an appointment for a RT-PCR test on December 26-31, 2020 at a public test center in Copenhagen, Denmark, were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, immediately followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD BIOSENSOR). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the antigen test were calculated with test results from RT-PCR as reference. Results: Overall, 4697 individuals were included (female n=2456, 53.3%; mean age: 44.7 years, SD: 16.9 years); 196 individuals were tested twice or more. Among 4811 paired conclusive test results from the RT-PCR and antigen tests, 221 (4.6%) RT-PCR tests were positive.

49,"Distinct Autoimmune Antibody Signatures Between Hospitalized Acute COVID-19 Patients, SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Individuals, and Unexposed Pre-Pandemic Controls","Abstract Increasing evidence suggests that autoimmunity may play a role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection during both the acute and ""long COVID"" phases of disease. However, an assessment of autoimmune antibodies in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients has not yet been reported. Methodology: We compared the levels of 18 different IgG autoantibodies (AABs) between four groups: (1) unexposed pre-pandemic subjects from the general population (n = 29); (2) individuals hospitalized with acute moderate to severe COVID-19 (n = 20); (3) convalescent SARS-COV-2-infected subjects with asymptomatic to mild viral symptoms during the acute phase with samples obtained between 1.8 and 7.3 months after infection (n = 9); and (4) unexposed pre-pandemic subjects with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) (n = 6). Total IgG and IgA levels were also measured from subjects in groups 1-3 to assess non-specific pan-B cell activation. Results: As expected, in multivariate analysis, AABs were detected at much higher odds in SLE subjects (5 of 6, 83%) compared to non-SLE pre-pandemic controls (11 of 29, 38%) [odds ratio (OR) 19.4,95% CI, 2.0 - 557.0, p = 0.03]. AAB detection (percentage of subjects with one or more autoantibodies) was higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected convalescent subjects (7 of 9, 78%) [OR 17.4, 95% CI, 2.0 - 287.4, p = 0.02] and subjects with acute COVID-19 (12 of 20, 60%) compared with non-SLE pre-pandemic controls, but was not statistically significant among the latter [OR 1.8,95% CI, 0.6 - 8.1, p = 0.23]. Within the convalescent subject group, AABs were detected in 5/5 with reported persistent symptoms and 2/4 without continued symptoms (p = 0.17). The multivariate computational algorithm Partial Least Squares Determinant Analysis (PLSDA) was used to determine if distinct AAB signatures distinguish subject groups 1-3. Of the 18 autoantibodies measured, anti-Beta 2-Glycoprotein, anti-Proteinase 3-ANCA, anti-Mi-2 and anti-PM/Scl-100 defined the convalescent group; anti-Proteinase 3-ANCA, anti-Mi-2, anti-Jo-1 and anti-RNP/SM defined acute COVID-19 subjects; and anti-Proteinase 3-ANCA, anti-Mi-2, anti-Jo-1, anti-Beta 2-Glycoprotein distinguished unexposed controls. The AABs defining SARS-COV-2 infected from pre-pandemic subjects are widely associated with myopathies, vasculitis, and antiphospholipid syndromes, conditions with some similarities to COVID-19. Compared to pre-pandemic non-SLE controls, subjects with acute COVID-19 had higher total IgG concentration (p-value=0.006) but convalescent subjects did not (p-value=0.08); no differences in total IgA levels were found between groups. Conclusions: Our findings support existing studies suggesting induction of immune responses to self-epitopes during acute, severe COVID-19 with evidence of general B cell hyperactivation. Also, the preponderance of AAB positivity among convalescent individuals up to seven months after infection indicates potential initiation or proliferation, and then persistence of self-reactive immunity without severe initial disease. These results underscore the importance of further investigation of autoimmunity during SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in the onset and persistence of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.",Nahid Bhadelia; Anna Belkina; Alex Olson; Thomas Winter; Patricia Urick; Nina Lin; Ian Rifkin; Yachana Kataria; Rachel Yuen; Manish Sagar; Jennifer Cappione,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249176,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249176,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
50,An interactive COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker (CovMT) with a particular focus on critical mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of the Spike protein,"Almost one year has passed since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of confirmed SARS-Cov-2 cases worldwide has now reached ~92 million, with 2 million reported deaths (https://covid19.who.int). Nearly 365,000 SARS-Cov-2 genomes were sequenced from COVID-19 samples and added to public resources such as GISAID (https://gisaid.org). With the vaccines becoming available or entering trials (https://covid19.trackvaccines.org), it is vital to keep track of mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region, which could have a potential impact on disease severity and treatment strategies. In the wake of a recent increase in cases with a potentially more infective RBD mutation (N501Y) in the United Kingdom, countries worldwide are concerned about the spread of this or similar variants. Impressive sampling and timely increase in sequencing efforts related to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom helped detect and monitor the spread of the new N501Y variant. Similar sequencing efforts are needed in other countries for timely tracking of this or different variants. To track geographic sequencing efforts and mutations, with a particular focus on RBD region of the Spike protein, we present our daily updated COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker system, see https://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/covmt.",Intikhab Alam; Aleksandar Radovanovic; Roberto Incitti; Allan Kamau; Muhammed Alarawi; Esam I.

51,Acute and persistent symptoms in non-hospitalized PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients,"Background: Reports of persistent symptoms after hospitalization with COVID-19 have raised concern of a long COVID syndrome. This study aimed at characterizing acute and persistent symptoms in non-hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19. Methods: Cohort study of 445 non-hospitalized participants identified via the Danish Civil Registration System with a SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR-test and available biobank samples for genetic analyses. Participants received a digital questionnaire on demographics and COVID-19-related symptoms. Persistent symptoms: symptoms >four weeks (in sensitivity analyses >12 weeks). Results: 445 participants were included, of whom 34% were asymptomatic. Most common acute symptoms were fatigue, headache, and sneezing, while fatigue and reduced smell and taste were reported as most severe. Persistent symptoms, most commonly fatigue and memory and concentration difficulties, were reported by 36% of 198 symptomatic participants with follow-up >four weeks. Risk factors for persistent symptoms included female sex (women 44% vs. men 24%, odds ratio 2.7, 95%CI:1.4-5.1, p=0.003) and BMI (odds ratio 1.1, 95%CI:1.0-1.2, p=0.001). Conclusion: Among non-hospitalized PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients one third were asymptomatic while one third of symptomatic participants had persistent symptoms illustrating the heterogeneity of disease presentation.

52,SARS-CoV-2 Control on a Large Urban College Campus Without Mass Testing,"Objective. A small percentage of universities and colleges conduct mass SARS-CoV-2 testing. However, universal testing is resource-intensive, strains national testing capacity, and false negative tests can encourage unsafe behaviors. Participants. A large urban university campus. Methods. Virus control centered on three pillars: mitigation, containment, and communication, with testing of symptomatic and a random subset of asymptomatic students. Results. Random surveillance testing demonstrated a prevalence among asymptomatic students of 0.4% throughout the term. There were two surges in cases that were contained by enhanced mitigation and communication combined with targeted testing. Cumulative cases totaled 445 for the term, most resulting from unsafe undergraduate student behavior and among students living off-campus. A case rate of 232/10,000 undergraduates equaled or surpassed several peer institutions that conducted mass testing. Conclusions. An emphasis on behavioral mitigation and communication can control virus transmission on a large urban campus combined with a limited and targeted testing strategy.",Christopher P O'Donnell; Katherine Brownlee; Elise Martin; Joe Suyama; Steven Middle Name(s)/Initial(s) Albert; Steven Anderson; Sai H Bhatte; Kenyon Bonner; Chad Burton; Micaela F Corn; Heather Eng; Bethany J Flage; Jay Frerotte; Goundappa K Balasubramani; Catherine L Haggerty; Joel Haight; Lee H Harrison; Amy Hartman; Thomas Hitter; Wendy C King; Kate Ledger; Jane W Marsh; Margaret C McDonald; Bethany R Miga; Kimberly D Moses; Anne W Newman; Meg Ringler; Mark S Roberts; Terrie Sax; Anantha Shekhar; Matthew Sterne; Tyler J Tenney; Marian Vanek; Alan Wells; Sally Wenzel; John V Williams,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249825,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249825,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
53,"COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing For All - Using Non-Dilutive Saliva Sample Collection, Stabilization and Ambient Transport Devices","Covid-19 testing is not accessible for millions during this pandemic despite our best efforts. Without greatly expanded testing of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing and subsequent isolation of spreaders remains unobtainable as a means for control. In an effort to increase RT-PCR assay testing for the presence of the novel beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as well as improve sample collection safety, GenTegra LLC has introduced two products for saliva collection and viral RNA stabilization: GTR-STM (GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium) and GTR-STMdk (GenTegra Saliva Transport Medium Direct to PCR). Both products contain a proprietary formulation based on GenTegra's novel ""Active Chemical ProtectionTM"" (ACP) technology that gives non-dilutive, error-free saliva sample collection using RNA stabilization chemicals already dried in the collection tube. GTR-STM can be used for safer saliva-based sample collection at home (or at a test site). Following saliva collection, the sample-containing GTR-STM can be kept at ambient temperature during shipment to an authorized CLIA lab for analysis. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in GTR-STM is stable for over a month at ambient temperature, easily surviving the longest transit times from home to lab. GTR-STM enhances patient comfort, convenience, compliance and reduces infectious virus exposure to essential medical and lab professionals. Alternatively, the GTR-STMdk direct-into-PCR product can be used to improve lab throughput and reduce reagent costs for saliva sample collection and testing at any lab site with access to refrigeration. GTR-STMdk reduces lab process time by 25% and reagent costs by 30% compared to other approaches. Since GTR-STMdk retains SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA stability for three days at ambient temperature, it is optimized for lab test site rather than at home saliva collection. SARS-COV-2 viral RNA levels as low as 0.4 genome equivalents/uL are detected in saliva samples using GTR-STMdk. This increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection can expand Covid-19 testing to include asymptomatic individuals using pooled saliva. The formal Limit of Detection (LoD) of SARS-CoV-2 in GTR-STM and GTR-STMdk in human saliva in individual and pooled samples will shortly be known.",Yuan Jin Carrington; Justin Orlino; Alejandro Romero; Jessica Rochelle Gustin; Mahssa Rezaei; Elizabeth Green; Summer Linn Rose; Ramani A.

54,High-altitude is associated with better short-term survival in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU,"Abstract Background: The novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has affected at least 218 countries worldwide. Some geographical and environmental factors are positively associated with a better or worse prognosis concerning COVID-19 disease and with lower or higher SARS-CoV-2 transmission. High altitude exposure has been associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 attack rates; nevertheless, the role of chronic high-altitude exposure on the clinical outcome of critically ill COVID-19 patients has not been studied. Objective: To compare the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in two intensive care units (ICU) located at low and high altitude. Exposure and Outcome: To explore the effect of two different elevations (10 m vs 2,850 m above sea level) on COVID-19 clinical outcome and survival. Methods: A prospective cohort, two-center study in confirmed COVID-19 adult patients admitted to a low altitude (Sea level) and high altitude (2,850 m) ICU units in Ecuador was conducted. Two hundred and thirty confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled from March 15th to July 15th, 2020. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters including supportive therapies, pharmacological treatments and medical complications were reported and compared between the low and high-altitude groups. Results: The median age of all the patients was 60 years, 64.8% were men and 35.2% were women. A total of 105 (45.7%) patients had at least one underlying comorbidity, the most frequent being chronic diseases, such as hypertension (33.5%), diabetes (16.5%), and chronic kidney failure (5.7%). The APACHE II scale at 72 hours was especially higher in the low-altitude group with a median of 18 points (IQR: 9.5-24.0), compared to 9 points (IQR: 5.0-22.0) obtained in the group of high altitude. There is evidence of a difference in survival in favor of the high-altitude group (p = 0.006), the median survival being 39 days, compared to 21 days in the low altitude group. Conclusion: There has been a substantial improvement in survival amongst people admitted to the high-altitude critical care unit. Low altitude living was associated with improved survival, especially among patients with no comorbidities. COVID-19 patients admitted to the high-altitude ICU unit have improved severity-of-disease classification system scores at 72 hours and reported better respiratory and ventilatory profiles than the low altitude group.",Pablo R Morocho Jaramillo; Katherine Simbana-Rivera; Javier V Velastegui Silva; Lenin Gomez-Barreno; Ana Ventimilla Campoverde; Juan F Novillo Cevallos; Washington Almache Guanoquiza; Silvio Cedeno Guevara; Luis G Imba Castro; Nelson A Moran Puerta; Alex Guayta Valladares; Alex Lister; Esteban Ortiz-Prado,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249811,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249811,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
55,Numbers of close contacts of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their association with government intervention strategies.,"Contact tracing is conducted with the primary purpose of interrupting transmission from individuals who are likely to be infectious to others. Secondary analyses of data on the numbers of close contacts of confirmed cases could also provide an early signal of increases in contact patterns that might precede larger than expected case numbers; evaluate the impact of government interventions on the number of contacts of confirmed cases; or provide information on contact rates between age cohorts for the purpose of epidemiological modelling. We analysed data from 140,204 contacts of 39861 cases in Ireland from 1st May to 1st December 2020. Only ""close"" contacts were included in the analysis. A close contact was defined as any individual who had had > 15 minutes face-to-face (<2 m) contact with a case; any household contact; or any individual sharing a closed space for longer than 2 hours, in any setting. The number of contacts per case was overdispersed, the mean varied considerably over time, and was temporally associated with government interventions. Negative binomial regression models highlighted greater numbers of contacts within specific population demographics, after correcting for temporal associations. Separate segmented regression models of the number of cases over time and the average number of contacts per case indicated that a breakpoint indicating a rapid decrease in the number of contacts per case in October 2020 preceded a breakpoint indicating a reduction in the number of cases by 11 days. These data were collected for a specific purpose and therefore any inferences must be made with caution. The data are representative of contact rates of cases, and not of the overall population. However, the data may be a more accurate indicator of the likely degree of onward transmission than might be the case if a random sample of the population were taken. Furthermore, since we analysed only the number of close contacts, the total number of contacts per case would have been higher. Nevertheless, this analysis provides useful information for monitoring the impact of government interventions on number of contacts; for helping pre-empt increases or decreases in case numbers, and for triangulating assumptions regarding the contact mixing rates between different age cohorts for epidemiological modelling.",Conor G McAloon; Patrick Wall; Francis Butler; Mary Codd; Eamonn Gormley; Cathal Walsh; Jim Duggan; T Brendan Murphy; Philip Nolan; Breda Smyth; Katie O'Brien; Conor Teljeur; Martin J Green; Kieran Culhane; Claire Buckley; Jennifer Martin; Sarah Doyle; Ciara Carroll; Simon J More,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250109,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250109,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
56,On mobility trends analysis of COVID-19 dissemination in Mexico City,"This work presents a forecast of the spread of the new coronavirus in Mexico City based on a mathematical model with metapopulation structure by using Bayesian Statistics inspired in a data-driven approach. The mobility of humans on a daily basis in Mexico City is mathematically represented by a origin-destination matrix using the open mobility data from Google and a Transportation Mexican Survey. This matrix, is incorporated in a compartmental model. We calibrate the model against borough-level incidence data collected between February 27, 2020 and October 27, 2020 using Bayesian inference to estimate critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the coronavirus spread. Since working with metapopulation models lead to rather high computational time consume, we do a clustering analysis based on mobility trends in order to work on these clusters of borough separately instead of taken all the boroughs together at once. This clustering analysis could be implemented in smaller or lager scale in different part of the world. In addition, this clustering analysis is divided in the phases that the government of Mexico City has set up to restrict the individuals movement in the city. Also, we calculate the reproductive number in Mexico City using the next generation operator method and the inferred model parameters. The analysis of mobility trends can be helpful in public health decisions.",Kernel Prieto; Maria Chavez-Hernandez; Jhoana Patricia Romero-Leiton,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250406,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250406,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
57,Predictive power of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance for diverse populations across a large geographical range,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the disparities in healthcare delivery in the US. Many communities had, and continue to have, limited access to COVID-19 testing, making it difficult to track the spread and impact of COVID-19 in early days of the outbreak. To address this issue we monitored severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA at the population-level using municipal wastewater influent from 19 cities across the state of Minnesota during the COVID-19 outbreak in Summer 2020. Viral RNA was detected in wastewater continually for 20-weeks for cities ranging in populations from 500 to >1, 000, 000. Using a novel indexing method, we were able to compare the relative levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for each city during this sampling period. Our data showed that viral RNA trends appeared to precede clinically confirmed cases across the state by several days. Lag analysis of statewide trends confirmed that wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels preceded new clinical cases by 15-17 days. At the regional level, new clinical cases lagged behind wastewater viral RNA anywhere from 4- 20 days. Our data illustrates the advantages of monitoring at the population-level to detect outbreaks. Additionally, by tracking infections with this unbiased approach, resources can be directed to the most impacted communities before the need outpaces the capacity of local healthcare systems.",Richard G Melvin; Nabiha Chaudhry; Onimitein Georgewill; Rebecca Freese; Glenn E Simmons Jr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250376,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21250376,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
58,Determinants of the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 during the first six months of the pandemic; A cross-country study,"COVID-19 pandemic raises an extraordinary challenge to the healthcare systems globally. The governments are taking key measures to constrain the corresponding health, social, and economic impacts, however, these measures vary depending on the nature of the crisis and country-specific circumstances. Objectives: Considering different incidence and mortality rates across different countries, we aimed at explaining variance of these variables by performing accurate and precise multivariate analysis with aid of suitable predictors, accordingly, the model would proactively guide the governmental responses to the crisis. Methods: Using linear and exponential time series analysis, this research aimed at studying the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in 18 countries during the first six months of the pandemic, and further utilize multivariate techniques to explain the variance in monthly exponential growth rates of cases and deaths with aid of a set of different predictors: the recorded Google mobility trends towards six categories of places, daily average temperature, daily humidity, and key socioeconomic attributes of each country. Results: The analysis showed that changes in mobility trends were the most significant predictors of the incidence and mortality rates, temperature and humidity were also significant but to a much lesser extent, on the other hand, the socioeconomic attributes did not contribute significantly to explaining different incidence and mortality rates across countries. Conclusion: Changes in mobility trends across countries dramatically affected the incidence and mortality rates across different countries, thus, it might be used as a proxy measure of contact frequency.",Noha Asem; Ahmed Mohamed Ramadan; Mohamed Hassany; Ramy Mohamed Ghazy; Mohamed Abdallah; Eman Gamal; Shimaa Hassan; Nehal Kamal; Hala Zaid,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250226,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250226,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0. Conclusion: Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions should account for the intrinsic differences between populations.",Jude Dzevela Kong; Edward Tekwa; Sarah Gignoux-Wolfsohn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250416,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250416,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
60,Rates of serious clinical outcomes in survivors of hospitalisation with COVID-19: a descriptive cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform,"Background Patients with COVID-19 are thought to be at higher risk of cardiometabolic and pulmonary complications, but quantification of that risk is limited. We aimed to describe the overall burden of these complications in survivors of severe COVID-19. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England we used data from the OpenSAFELY platform linking primary care records to death certificate and hospital data. We constructed two cohorts: a COVID-19 cohort consisting of patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, and a comparison population of patients discharged following hospitalisation with pneumonia in 2019. Outcomes included DVT, PE, ischaemic stroke, MI, heart failure, AKI and new type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Outcome rates from hospital discharge were measured in each cohort, stratified by patient demographics and 30-day period. We fitted Cox regression models to estimate crude and age/sex adjusted hazard ratios comparing outcome rates between the two cohorts. Results Amongst the population of 31,569 patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, the highest rates were observed for heart failure (199.3; 95% CI: 191.8 - 207.1) and AKI (154.5; 95% CI: 147.9 - 161.4). Rates of DVT, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, MI, PE and diabetes were high over the four months post discharge, especially in the first month. Patterns were broadly similar to those seen in patients discharged with pneumonia but somewhat higher in the COVID-19 population for stroke (adj-HR 1.78; 95% CI: 1.53 - 2.08), PE (adj-HR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.21 - 1.58), MI (adj-HR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.20 - 1.76), AKI (adj-HR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.19 - 1.36) and T2DM (adj-HR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.50). Conclusions In this descriptive study of survivors of severe COVID-19, rates of the measured outcomes are at least as high, though in some cases slightly higher, than in patients discharged after hospitalisation with pneumonia.

61,Using Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and High Isolation of Asymptomatic Carriers to Contain the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes,"Objective. Using a pandemic influenza model modified for COVID-19, this study investigated the degree of control over pre-symptomatic transmission that common non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would require to reduce the spread in long-term care facilities. Methods. We created a stochastic compartmental SEIR model with Poisson-distributed transition states that compared the effect of R0, common NPIs, and isolation rates of pre-symptomatic carriers primarily on attack rate, peak cases, and timing in a 200-resident nursing home. Model sensitivity was assessed with 1st order Sobol' indices. Results. The most rigorous NPIs decreased the peak number of infections by 4.3 and delayed the peak by 9.7 days in the absence of pre-symptomatic controls. Reductions in attack rate were not likely, even with rigorous application of all defined NPIs, unless pre-symptomatic carriers were identified and isolated at rates exceeding 76%. Attack rate was most sensitive to the pre-symptomatic isolation rate (Sobol' index > 0.7) and secondarily to R0. Conclusions. Common NPIs delayed and reduced epidemic peaks. Reducing attack rates ultimately required efficient isolation of pre-symptomatic cases, including rapid antigen tests on a nearly daily basis. This must be accounted for in testing and contact tracing plans for group living settings.",Alec J Schmidt; Yury Garcia; Diego Pinheiro; Tom Reichert; Miriam Nuno,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249308,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21249308,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
62,Tracking the mental health of home-carers during the first COVID-19 national lockdown: evidence from a nationally representative UK survey,"Background: Unpaid carers who look after another member of their household (home-carers) have poorer mental health than the general population. The first COVID-19 national lockdown led to an increasing reliance on home-carers and we investigate the short and longer-term impact of lockdown on their mental health. Methods: Data from 9,737 adult participants (aged 16+) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) were used to explore changes in 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score between (a) pre-pandemic (2019) and early lockdown (April 2020) and (b) early and later (July 2020) lockdown. Results: GHQ-12 scores among home-carers were higher pre-lockdown and increased more than for non-carers from 2019 to April 2020 with further increases for home-carers compared with non-carers between April and July. Compared with respondents caring for a spouse/partner, those caring for a child under 18 had a particularly marked increase in GHQ-12 score between 2019 and April, as did those caring for someone with learning difficulties. Home-carers of children under 18 improved from April to July while those caring for adult children saw a marked worsening of their mental health. Home-carers with greater care burden saw larger increases in GHQ-12 score from 2019 to April and from April to July, and increases through both periods were greater for home-carers who had formal help prior to lockdown but then lost it. Conclusions: The mental health of home-carers deteriorated more during lockdown than non-carers. Policies that reinstate support for them and their care-recipients will benefit the health of both vulnerable groups.",Elise Whitley; Kelly Reeve; Michaela Benzeval,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250437,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250437,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
63,An external validation of the QCovid risk prediction algorithm for risk of mortality from COVID-19 in adults: national validation cohort study in England,"Background: To externally validate a risk prediction algorithm (QCovid) to estimate mortality outcomes from COVID-19 in adults in England. Methods: Population-based cohort study using the ONS Public Health Linked Data Asset, a cohort based on the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, the General Practice Extraction Service Data for pandemic planning and research, radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records. The primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as per death certification. Two time periods were used: (a) 24thJanuary to 30thApril 2020; and (b) 1st May to 28th July 2020. We evaluated the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of discrimination and calibration for each validation time period. Findings: The study comprises 34,897,648 adults aged 19-100 years resident in England There were 26,985 COVID-19 deaths during the first time-period and 13,177 during the second. The algorithms had good calibration in the validation cohort in both time periods with close correspondence of observed and predicted risks. They explained 77.1% (95% CI: 76.9% to 77.4%) of the variation in time to death in men in the first time-period (R2); the D statistic was 3.76 (95% CI: 3.73 to 3.79); Harrell's C was 0.935 (0.933 to 0.937) Similar results were obtained for women, and in the second time-period In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths in the first time period was 65.9% for men and 71.7% for women. People in the top 20% of predicted risks of death accounted for 90.8% of all COVID-19 deaths for men and 93.0% for women. Interpretation: The QCovid population-based risk algorithm performed well, showing very high levels of discrimination for COVID-19 deaths in men and women for both time periods. It has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves and therefore, has potential use in guiding national policy.

64,Using an Ecological and Biological Framing for an Anti-racist Covid-19 Approach,"In the United States and the United Kingdom COVID-19 has disportionately affected Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people respectively. Multiple studies identify environmental factors such as overcrowded housing and poor workplace conditions as contributing factors for the disproportionate COVID-19 rates amongst BAME and BIPOC communities. This paper will show that to fully understand the phenomenon, both an ecological and biological approach is needed. An ecological approach highlights how a person's habitat and the experiences within it mediate their susceptibility to disease. Moreover, to understand how this mediation works, this paper will use allostatic load as a biological pathway to link a person to their habitat and the poor health outcomes that contributed to COVID-19 susceptibility. In introducing this new approach, the paper will serve as an anti-racist framework for understanding how COVID-19 affected BAME and BIPOC communities. It is anti-racist by centering poor health outcomes on the habitats people are forced to live in due to structural racism rather than the physiology of a person's race or ethnicity. This is important in order to avoid similar crises in the future and to improve the health of marginalised communities.",Araceli Camargo; Elahi Hossain; Sarah Aliko; Daniel Akinola-Odusola; Josh Artus; Ilan Kelman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250397,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250397,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
65,Existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on ambient particulate matter samples: A nationwide study in Turkey,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has been affecting the world since the end of 2019. Turkey is severely affected with the first case being reported on March 11th 2020. Ambient particulate matter (PM) samples in various size ranges were collected from 13 sites including urban and urban background locations and hospital gardens in 10 cities across Turkey between the 13th of May and the 14th of June, 2020 to investigate a possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on ambient PM. A total of 155 daily samples (TSP, n=80; PM2.5, n=33; PM2.5-10, n=23; PM10, n=19; and 6 size segregated, n=48) were collected using various samplers in each city. The N1 gene and RdRP gene expressions were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to RT-PCR and 3D-RT-PCR analysis, dual RdRP and N1 gene positivity were detected in 20 (9.8 %) of the samples. The highest percentage of virus detection on PM samples was from hospital gardens in Tekirdag, Zonguldak, and Istanbul, especially in PM2.5 mode. Samples collected from two urban sites were also positive. Findings of this study have suggested that SARS CoV2 may be transported by ambient particles especially at sites close to the infection hot-spots.

67,Analytical and clinical evaluation of antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies used in Finland in 2020,"Background: Sensitive and highly specific antibody tests are critical for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies especially in populations where seroprevalence is low. Aim: To set up, optimize and evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of a new in-house microsphere immunoassay for measurement of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein for assessment of population seroprevalence in Finland. Methods: We set up a new in-house microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) with SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and optimized its analytical performance. For evaluation of clinical performance, we tested sera collected in a well-characterized cohort of PCR positive-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=89) with mostly mild symptoms, and before the COVID-19 pandemic (n=402), for nucleoprotein specific IgG concentrations by FMIA and a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay and for neutralizing antibodies by the microneutralization test. Results: The analytical performance of FMIA was established in terms of sensitivity, linearity and precision. FMIA discriminated between COVID-19 patient and control samples with high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (100%). We generated FMIA seropositivity cut-offs, 0.46 and 1.71 U/ml, for low- and high-seroprevalence settings, respectively. In addition, we obtained high level of agreement between FMIA results and results by the microneutralization test. Conclusion: The fluorescent microsphere immunoassay showed excellent analytical and clinical performance and is well suited for serosurveillance studies of SARS-CoV-2. However, to optimize analytical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the assay, different seropositivity thresholds depending on the intended use of the assay and the target population, may be needed.",Nina Ekström; Camilla Virta; Anu Haveri; Timothée Dub; Lotta Hagberg; Anna Solastie; Pamela Österlund; Terhi Vihervaara; Iris Erlund; Hanna Nohynek; Merit Melin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250207,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250207,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True

We aimed to examine the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among 2,160 healthcare workers in general hospitals and clinics in Japan. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G was 1.2% in August and October 2020, which is relatively higher than that in the general population in Japan.

69,Prediction of In-hospital Mortality among Adults with COVID-19 Infection,"IMPORTANCE: Accurate and rapid prediction of the probability of dying from COVID-19 infection might help triage patients for hospitalization, intensive care, or limited treatment. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple tool to estimate the probability of dying from acute COVID-19 illness. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included 13,190 adult patients admitted to one of the 11 hospitals in the New York City Health + Hospitals system for COVID-19 infection between March 1 and June 30, 2020. EXPOSURES: Demographic characteristics, vital signs, and laboratory tests readily available at the time of hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME: Death from any cause during hospitalization. RESULTS: Patients had a mean age (interquartile range) of 58 (45-72) years; 5421 (41%) were women, 5258 Latinx (40%), 3805 Black (29%), 1168 White (9%), and 2959 Other (22%). During hospitalization, 2,875 (22%) died. Using separate test and validation samples, machine learning (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) identified eight variables, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse rate, blood urea nitrogen level, age and creatinine, that predicted mortality, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 94%. A score based on these variables classified 5,677 (46%) as low risk (a score of 0) who had 0.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.5, 1.0%) risk of dying, and 674 (5.4%) as high-risk (score [&ge;] 12 points) who had a 97.6% (96.5, 98.8%) risk of dying; the remainder had intermediate risks. A risk calculator is available online at https://danielevanslab.shinyapps.io/Covid_mortality/).

70,Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) status in people with suspected COVID-19: Secondary analysis of the PRIEST observational cohort study,"Background Cardiac arrest is common in people admitted with suspected COVID-19 and has a poor prognosis. Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) orders can reduce the risk of futile resuscitation attempts but have raised ethical concerns. Objectives We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of adults admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 according to their DNAR status and identify factors associated with an early DNAR decision. Methods We undertook a secondary analysis of 13977 adults admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 and included in the Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage (PRIEST) study. We recorded presenting characteristics and outcomes (death or organ support) up to 30 days. We categorised patients as early DNAR (occurring before or on the day of admission) or late/no DNAR (no DNAR or occurring after the day of admission). We undertook descriptive analysis comparing these groups and multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of early DNAR. Results We excluded 1249 with missing DNAR data, and identified 3929/12748 (31%) with an early DNAR decision. They had higher mortality (40.7% v 13.1%) and lower use of any organ support (11.6% v 15.7%), but received a range of organ support interventions, with some being used at rates comparable to those with late or no DNAR (e.g. non-invasive ventilation 4.4% v 3.5%). On multivariable analysis, older age (p<0.001), active malignancy (p<0.001), chronic lung disease (p<0.001), limited performance status (p<0.001), and abnormal physiological variables were associated with increased recording of early DNAR. Asian ethnicity was associated with reduced recording of early DNAR (p=0.001). Conclusions Early DNAR decisions were associated with recognised predictors of adverse outcome, and were also associated with Asian ethnicity. Most people with an early DNAR decision survived to 30 days and many received potentially life-saving interventions.",Laura Sutton; Steve Goodacre; Benjamin Thomas; Sarah Connelly,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21249978,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.23.21249978,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
71,Prevalent comorbidities among young and underprivileged: Death portrait of COVID-19 among 235 555 hospitalized patients in Brazil,"Background COVID 19 has been alarmingly spreading worldwide, with Brazil ranking third in total number of cases and second in deaths. Being a continental country, which comprises many ethnic groups and an engrained social inequality, the pandemic evidenced this heterogeneous discrepancy. We aimed to estimate the impact of associated risk factors, isolated or combined, on COVID 19 severeness, detecting specific epidemiological profiles for multiple age ranges in hospitalized Brazilians. Methods In this large retrospective cohort study, we used open-access data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil with COVID 19 confirmed hospitalized patients annotated in SRAG system between February and August 2020, a total of 235555 entries. The association of COVID 19 death with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics was analysed and presented as odds ratios adjusted by confounding co-variables. We also presented marginal mean aOR values for high-order interactions either by or not another fixed level or condition. We kept all other variables in the multivariate logistic models in their mean values or equal proportions. Findings Younger individuals with one or more comorbidities had an adjusted odds ratio up to four-fold compared to those without it, in the same age interval. Younger diabetic patients either self-declared as brown ethnicity (aOR 5,58, 95% CI 4,97-6,25; p < 0,0001) or with some other associated comorbidities, mainly chronic hematologic disease (21,09, 13,64-32,6; p < 0,0001) and obesity (aOR 21,7, 95% CI not calculated; p < 0,0001), resulted in outstanding death risk. Age over 60, particularly over 90 (28,91, 24,5-34,11; p < 0,001), usage of invasive ventilatory support (16,23, 14,05-18,75; p < 0,001), admission to intensive care units (3,14, 2,82-3,48; p < 0,001), multiple respiratory symptoms (3,24, 2,79-3,75; p < 0,0001), black ethnicity (1,78, 1,52-2,07; p < 0,05), and diagnosis previous to hospitalization (1,32, 1,19-1,47; p < 0,05) were associated with higher death odds. As protective factors, with roughly one third less death risk, we found hospitalization duration of (4, 7] days and illness onset to hospitalization over 6 days. Interpretation We found evidence for increased COVID 19 risk in two distinct groups: younger patients with prevalent comorbidities, especially in brown ethnicity, and patients with black ethnicity. We speculate that the pro-inflammatory synergism of COVID 19 and comorbidities, promoting an overproduction of cytokines, is partially the cause of higher mortality in this young group. Brazilian black and brown are underprivileged populations, with structural social inequality, limited healthcare access and, thus, remarkable disease vulnerability. Our study supplies essential data to patient stratification upon admission, optimizing hospital management, and to guide public policy determinations, including group prioritization for COVID 19 vaccination in Brazil.",Eduardo Pietre Sr.; Gabriel Pessanha Amorim; Maria Fernanda Bittencourt; Marcelo Ribeiro-Alves Sr.; Mariana Acquarone,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250346,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250346,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
72,Mental health and wellbeing amongst people with informal caring responsibilities across different time points during the COVID-19 pandemic: A population-based propensity score matching analysis,"Aims. Due to a prolonged period of national and regional lockdown measures during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been an increase reliance on informal care and a consequent increase in care intensity for informal carers. In light of this, the current study compared the experiences of carers and non-carers on various mental health and wellbeing measures across 5 key time points during the pandemic. Methods. Data analysed were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. Our study focused on 5 time points in England: (i) the first national lockdown (March-April 2020; N=12,053); (ii) the beginning of lockdown rules easing (May 2020; N=24,374); (iii) further easing (July 2020; N=21,395); (iv) new COVID-19 restrictions (September 2020; N=4,792); and (v) the three-tier system restrictions (October 2020; N=4,526). We considered 5 mental health and wellbeing measures- depression, anxiety, loneliness, life satisfaction and sense of worthwhile. Propensity score matching were applied for the analyses. Results. We found that informal carers experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety than non-carers across all time points. During the first national lockdown, carers also experienced a higher sense of life being worthwhile. No association was found between informal caring responsibilities and levels of loneliness and life satisfaction. Conclusion. Given that carers are an essential national health care support, especially during a pandemic, it is crucial to integrate carers' needs into healthcare planning and delivery. These results highlight there is a pressing need to provide adequate and targeted mental health support for carers during and following this pandemic.",Hei Wan Mak; Feifei Bu; Daisy Fancourt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250045,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250045,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,True
73,High-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater provides insights into circulating variants,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from a zoonotic spill-over event and has led to a global pandemic. The public health response has been predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing, with quarantine, and other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread. Non-traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) have also been leveraged during this pandemic. Genomic epidemiology uses high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to inform local and international transmission events, as well as the diversity of circulating variants. WBE uses wastewater to analyse community spread, as it is known that SARS-CoV-2 is shed through bodily excretions. Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs, we hypothesized that the resultant pooled sample of population-wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive picture of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and sequencing alone. In this study, we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the USA, where the majority of samples represent Maricopa County, Arizona (USA). With the objective of assessing the viral diversity at a population scale, we undertook a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis on data from 52 samples with >90% SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage of sequence reads, and compared these SNVs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients. We identified 7973 SNVs, of which 5680 were novel SNVs that had not yet been identified in the global clinical-derived data as of 17th June 2020 (the day after our last wastewater sampling date). However, between 17th of June 2020 and 20th November 2020, almost half of the SNVs have since been detected in clinical-derived data. Using the combination of SNVs present in each sample, we identified the more probable lineages present in that sample and compared them to lineages observed in North America prior to our sampling dates. The wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence data indicates there were more lineages circulating across the sampled communities than represented in the clinical-derived data. Principal coordinate analyses identified patterns in population structure based on genetic variation within the sequenced samples, with clear trends associated with increased diversity likely due to a higher number of infected individuals relative to the sampling dates. We demonstrate that genetic correlation analysis combined with SNVs analysis using wastewater sampling can provide a comprehensive snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic population structure circulating within a community, which might not be observed if relying solely on clinical cases.",Rafaela S.

74,Ubiquitin ligase RIPLET mediates polyubiquitination of RIG-I and LGP2 and regulates the innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"RIG-I, a cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor, is crucial for innate antiviral immune responses; however, there are controversies about the regulatory mechanism of RIG-I by several ubiquitin ligases and LGP2. This study revealed that the RIPLET ubiquitin ligase is a general activating factor for RIG-I signaling. In contrast, another ubiquitin ligase, TRIM25, activated RIG-I in a cell-type-specific manner. RIPLET and TRIM25 functions were modulated by accessory factors, such as ZCCH3C and NLRP12. Interestingly, we found an additional role of RIPLET in innate immune responses. RIPLET induced delayed polyubiquitination of LGP, resulting in the attenuation of excessive cytokine expression at the late phase. Moreover, RIPLET was involved in the innate immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection, a cause of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Our data indicate that RIPLET fine-tunes innate immune responses via polyubiquitination of RIG-I and LGP2 against virus infection, including SARS-CoV-2.",Takahisa Kouwaki; Tasuku Nishimura; Guanming Wang; Reiko Nakagawa; Hiroyuki Oshiumi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428042,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428042,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
75,A multiscale model suggests that a moderately weak inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I IFN could accelerate the clearance of the virus,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible RNA virus that emerged in China at the end of 2019 and caused a large global outbreak. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune response is complex because it is regulated by various processes taking part at the intracellular, tissue, and host levels. To gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19, we formulate a multiscale model that integrate the main mechanisms which regulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 across multiple scales. The model describes the effect of type I interferon on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 inside cells. At the tissue level, we simulate the interactions between infected cells and immune cells using a hybrid agent-based representation. At the same time, we model the dynamics of virus spread and adaptive immune response in the host organism. After model validation, we demonstrate that a moderately weak inhibition of virus replication by type I IFN could elicit a strong adaptive immune response which accelerates the clearance of the virus. Furthermore, numerical simulations suggest that the deficiency of lymphocytes and not dendritic cells could lead to unfavourable outcomes in the elderly population.",Anass Bouchnita; Alexey Tokarev; Vitaly Volpert,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427896,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427896,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
76,Next generation vaccine platform: polymersomes as stable nanocarriers for a highly immunogenic and durable SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit vaccine,"Multiple successful vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to address the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In the present work, we describe a subunit vaccine based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein co-administered with CpG adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of our formulation, both antigen and adjuvant were encapsulated with our proprietary artificial cell membrane (ACM) polymersome technology. Structurally, ACM polymersomes are self-assembling nanoscale vesicles made up of an amphiphilic block copolymer comprising of polybutadiene-b-polyethylene glycol and a cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane.

77,"Effect of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on protein stability, cleavage, and cell-cell fusion function","The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) is the sole viral protein responsible for both viral binding to a host cell and the membrane fusion event needed for cell entry. In addition to facilitating fusion needed for viral entry, S can also drive cell-cell fusion, a pathogenic effect observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. While several studies have investigated S requirements involved in viral particle entry, examination of S stability and factors involved in S cell-cell fusion remain limited. We demonstrate that S must be processed at the S1/S2 border in order to mediate cell-cell fusion, and that mutations at potential cleavage sites within the S2 subunit alter S processing at the S1/S2 border, thus preventing cell-cell fusion. We also identify residues within the internal fusion peptide and the cytoplasmic tail that modulate S cell-cell fusion. Additionally, we examine S stability and protein cleavage kinetics in a variety of mammalian cell lines, including a bat cell line related to the likely reservoir species for SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence that proteolytic processing alters the stability of the S trimer. This work therefore offers insight into S stability, proteolytic processing, and factors that mediate S cell-cell fusion, all of which help give a more comprehensive understanding of this highly sought-after therapeutic target.",Chelsea T.

We report that Nsp12, a catalytic subunit of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, produces an inactive enzyme when codon-optimized for bacterial expression. We also show that accessory subunits, NTPs, and translation by slow ribosomes partially rescue Nsp12.

79,Molecular Dynamics Reveals the Effects of Temperature on Critical SARS-CoV-2 Proteins,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified RNA virus that causes the serious infection Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The incidence of COVID-19 is still increasing worldwide despite the summer heat and cool winter. However, little is known about seasonal stability of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the effect of temperature on four critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Our work demonstrates that the spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Main protease (Mpro), and nonstructural protein 3 (macro X) possesses extreme thermos-stability when subjected to temperature variations rendering them attractive drug targets. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these four proteins are well adapted to habitable temperatures on earth and are largely insensitive to cold and warm climates. Furthermore, we report that the critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD were less responsive to temperature variations as compared to the critical residues in SARS-CoV. As such, extreme summer and winter climates, and the transition between the two seasons, are expected to have a negligible effect on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 which will marginally suppress transmission rates until effective drugs are available.",Paul Morgan; Chih-Wen Shu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.427990,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.427990,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
80,mRNA-1273 efficacy in a severe COVID-19 model: attenuated activation of pulmonary immune cells after challenge,"The mRNA-1273 vaccine was recently determined to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from interim Phase 3 results. Human studies, however, cannot provide the controlled response to infection and complex immunological insight that are only possible with preclinical studies. Hamsters are the only model that reliably exhibit more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease similar to hospitalized patients, making them pertinent for vaccine evaluation. We demonstrate that prime or prime-boost administration of mRNA-1273 in hamsters elicited robust neutralizing antibodies, ameliorated weight loss, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in the airways, and better protected against disease at the highest prime-boost dose. Unlike in mice and non-human primates, mRNA-1273-mediated immunity was non-sterilizing and coincided with an anamnestic response. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung tissue permitted high resolution analysis which is not possible in vaccinated humans. mRNA-1273 prevented inflammatory cell infiltration and the reduction of lymphocyte proportions, but enabled antiviral responses conducive to lung homeostasis. Surprisingly, infection triggered transcriptome programs in some types of immune cells from vaccinated hamsters that were shared, albeit attenuated, with mock-vaccinated hamsters. Our results support the use of mRNA-1273 in a two-dose schedule and provides insight into the potential responses within the lungs of vaccinated humans who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428136,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428136,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
81,Profiling transcription factor sub-networks in type I interferon signaling and in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Type I interferons (IFN /{beta}) play a central role in innate immunity to respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses. Genetic defects in type I interferon signaling were reported in a significant proportion of critically ill CoOVID-19 patients. Extensive studies on interferon-induced intracellular signal transduction pathways led to the elucidation of the Jak-Stat pathway. Furthermore, advances in gene expression profiling by microarrays have revealed that type I interferon rapidly induced multiple transcription factor mRNA levels. In this study, transcription factor profiling in the transcriptome was used to gain novel insights into the role of inducible transcription factors in response to type I interferon signaling in immune cells and in lung epithelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Modeling the interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA data in terms of distinct sub-networks based on biological functions such as antiviral response, immune modulation, and cell growth revealed enrichment of specific transcription factors in mouse and human immune cells. The evolutionarily conserved core type I interferon gene expression consists of the inducible transcriptional factor mRNA of the antiviral response sub-network and enriched in granulocytes. Analysis of the type I interferon-inducible transcription factor sub-networks as distinct protein-protein interaction pathways revealed insights into the role of critical hubs in signaling. Interrogation of multiple microarray datasets revealed that SARS-CoV-2 induced high levels of IFN-beta and interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA in human lung epithelial cells. Transcription factor mRNA of the three major sub-networks regulating antiviral, immune modulation, and cell growth were differentially regulated in human lung epithelial cell lines after SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the tissue samples of COVID-19 patients. A subset of type I interferon-inducible transcription factors and inflammatory mediators were specifically enriched in the lungs and neutrophils of Covid-19 patients. The emerging complex picture of type I IFN transcriptional regulation consists of a rapid transcriptional switch mediated by the Jak-Stat cascade and a graded output of the inducible transcription factor activation that enables temporal regulation of gene expression.",Ramana Chilakamarti,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428122,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428122,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
82,Longitudinal analysis of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in convalescent individuals up to 8 months post-symptom onset,"Functional and lasting immune responses to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are currently under intense investigation as antibody titers in plasma have been shown to decline during convalescence. Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory, we sought to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients. In this study, we report on the evolution of the overall humoral immune responses on 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19 convalescent patients between 16 and 233 days post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma declines rapidly compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells, which increase over time, and the number of IgG+ memory B cells which remain stable thereafter for up to 8 months after symptoms onset. With the recent approval of highly effective vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of immune responses are of central importance. Even though overall circulating SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies contract over time during convalescence, we demonstrate that RBD-specific B cells increase and persist up to 8 months post symptom onset. We also observe modest increases in RBD-specific IgG+ memory B cells and importantly, detectable IgG and sustained Fc-effector activity in plasma over the 8-month period. Our results add to the current understanding of immune memory following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical for the prevention of secondary infections, vaccine efficacy and herd immunity against COVID-19.",Sai Priya Anand; Jeremie Prevost; Manon Nayrac; Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussieres; Mehdi Benlarbi; Romain Gasser; Nathalie Brassard; Annemarie Laumaea; Shang Yu Gong; Catherine Bourassa; Elsa Brunet-Ratnasingham; Halima Medjahed; Gabrielle Gendron-Lepage; Guillaume Goyette; Laurie Gokool; Chantal Morrisseau; Philippe Begin; Valerie Martel-Laferriere; Cecile Tremblay; Jonathan Richard; Renee Bazin; Ralf Duerr; Daniel E Kaufmann; Andres Finzi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428097,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.428097,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
83,SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding mutations and antibody mediated immunity.,"SARS-CoV-2 mutations can impact infectivity, viral load, and overall morbidity/mortality during infection. In this analysis, we look at the mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, a structure that is antigenic and allows for viral binding to the host. We analyze 104193 GISAID sequences acquired on October 15th, 2020 with a majority of sequences (96%) containing point mutations. We report high frequency mutations with improved binding affinity to ACE2 including S477N, N439K, V367F, and N501Y and address the potential impact of RBD mutations on antibody binding. The high frequency S477N mutation is present in 6.7% of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences, co-occurs with D614G, and is currently present in 14 countries. To address RBD-antibody interactions we take a subset of human derived antibodies and define their interacting residues using PDBsum. Our analysis shows that adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 enlists broad coverage of the RBD suggesting that antibody mediated immunity should be sufficient to resolve infection in the presence of RBD point mutations that conserve structure.",Marios Mejdani; Kiandokht Haddadi; Chester Pham; Radhakrishnan Mahadevan,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427846,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.427846,2021-01-25,2021-01-25,,False
84,The CXCR6/CXCL16 axis links inflamm-aging to disease severity in COVID-19 patients,"Advancing age and chronic health conditions, significant risk factors for severe COVID-19, are associated with a pro-inflammatory state, termed inflamm-aging. CXCR6+ T cells are known to traffic to the lung and have been reported to increase with age. The ligand of CXCR6, CXCL16, is constitutively expressed in the lung and upregulated during inflammatory responses and the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis is associated with severe lung disease and pneumonia. Genome-wide association studies have also recently identified 3p21.31, encompassing the CXCR6 gene, as a susceptibility locus for severe COVID-19. We assessed numbers T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR6 and plasma levels of CXCL16, in control and COVID-19 patients. Results demonstrated that circulating CD8+CXCR6+ T cells were significantly elevated with advancing age, yet virtually absent in patients with severe COVID-19. Peripheral levels of CXCL16 were significantly upregulated in severe COVID-19 patients compared to either mild COVID-19 patients or SARS-CoV-2 negative controls.

86,CD8+ T cell epitope variations suggest a potential antigen presentation deficiency for spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 is caused by a newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and has become a pandemic around the world. The illustration of the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and its vaccine development. CD8+ T cells are critical for virus clearance and induce long lasting protection in the host. Here we identified specific HLA-A2 restricted T cell epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Seven epitope peptides (n-Sp1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14) were confirmed to bind with HLA-A2 and potentially be presented by antigen presenting cells to induce host immune responses. Tetramers containing these peptides could interact with specific CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients, and one dominant epitope (n-Sp1) was defined. In addition, these epitopes could activate and generate epitope-specific T cells in vitro, and those activated T cells showed cytotoxicity to target cells. Meanwhile, all these epitopes exhibited high frequency of variations. Among them, n-Sp1 epitope variation 5L>F significantly decreased the proportion of specific T cell activation; n-Sp1 epitope 8L>V variant showed significantly reduced binding to HLA-A2 and decreased the proportion of n-Sp1-specific CD8+ T cell, which potentially contributes to the immune escape of SAR-CoV-2.",Congling Qiu; Chanchan Xiao; Zhigang Wang; Xiongfei Chen; Lijuan Gao; Jieping Den; Jun Su; Huanxin Su; Evandro Fei Fang; ZhangJing Zhang; Jikai Zhang; Oscar Junhong Luo; Pengchen Wang; Guobing Chen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.427863,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.427863,2021-01-24,2021-01-24,,False

Early detection of emotional feelings and their trends help implement timely intervention strategies. Given the limitations of medical diagnosis of early emotional change signs during the quarantine period, artificial intelligence models provide effective mechanisms in uncovering early signs, symptoms and escalating trends. Novelty of the approach presented herein is a multitask methodological framework of text data processing, implemented as a pipeline for meaningful emotion detection and analysis, based on the Plutchik/Ekman approach to emotion detection and trend detection. We present an evaluation of the framework and a pilot system. Results of confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework for topic trends and emotion detection of COVID-19 tweets. Our findings revealed Stay-At-Home restrictions result in people expressing on twitter both negative and positive emotional semantics. Semantic trends of safety issues related to staying at home rapidly decreased within the 28 days and also negative feelings related to friends dying and quarantined life increased in some days.

88,In silico investigation of the new UK (B.1.1.7) and South African (501Y.V2) SARS-CoV-2 variants with a focus at the ACE2-Spike RBD interface,"SARS-CoV-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to invade cells. It has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission capabilities, eventually due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor and several in silico methods to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements (Spike K417N, E484K, N501Y) with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement in this region of the interface (present in both UK and South African strains) should be favorable for the interaction with ACE2 while the K417N and E484K substitutions (South African) would seem unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African strain could counterbalance the predicted less favorable (regarding binding) K417N and E484K Spike replacements. Our finding suggests that, if indeed the South African strain has a high transmission level, this could be due to the N501Y replacement and/or to substitutions in regions outside the direct Spike-ACE2 interface.",Bruno Villoutreix; Vincent Calvez; Anne-Genevieve Marcelin; Abdel-Majid Khatib,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.427939,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.427939,2021-01-24,2021-01-24,,False

To date, 1261903 total cases and 55830 deaths are reported from Iran as of 8 January. In this study, we investigated all the complete sequences of SARS-CoV-2 that publicly reported from Iran. Twenty-four sequences between March to September 2020 were analyzed to identify genome variations and phylogenetic relationships. Furthermore, we assessed the amino acid changes related to the spike glycoprotein as an important viral factor associated with the entry to the host cells and as a vaccine target. Most of the variations occur in the ORF1ab, S, N, intergenic, and ORF7 regions. The analysis of spike protein mutations demonstrated that the D614G mutation could be detected from May and beyond. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the circulated viruses in Iran are belong to the B.4 lineage. Although, we found a limited number of variants associated with the B.1 lineage carrying D614G mutation. Furthermore, we detected a variant characterize as the B.1.36 lineage with sixteen mutations in the spike protein region. This study showed the frequency of the viral populations in Iran as of September, therefore, there is an emergent need for genomic surveillance to track viral lineage shift in the country beyond September.

90,Meta-analysis reveals consistent immune response patterns in COVID-19 infected patients at single-cell resolution,"A number of single-cell RNA studies looking at the human immune response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been recently published. However, the number of samples used in each individual study typically is small, moreover the technologies and protocols used in different studies vary, thus somewhat restricting the range of conclusions that can be made with high confidence. To better capture the cellular gene expression changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different levels and stages of disease severity and to minimise the effect of technical artefacts, we performed meta-analysis of data from 9 previously published studies, together comprising 143 human samples, and a set of 16 healthy control samples (10X). In particular, we used generally accepted immune cell markers to discern specific cell subtypes and to look at the changes of the cell proportion over different disease stages and their consistency across the studies. While half of the observations reported in the individual studies can be confirmed across multiple studies, half of the results seem to be less conclusive. In particular, we show that the differentially expressed genes consistently point to upregulation of type I Interferon signal pathway and downregulation of the mitochondrial genes, alongside several other reproducibly consistent changes. We also confirm the presence of expanded B-cell clones in COVID-19 patients, however, no consistent trend in T-cell clonal expansion was observed.",Manik Garg; Xu Li; Pablo Andres Moreno Cortez; Irene Papatheodorou; Yuelong Shu; Alvis Brazma; Zhichao Miao,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.427089,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.427089,2021-01-24,2021-01-24,,False
91,An Autoantigen Atlas from Human Lung HFL1 Cells Offers Clues to Neurological and Diverse Autoimmune Manifestations of COVID-19,"COVID-19 is accompanied by a myriad of both transient and long-lasting autoimmune responses. Dermatan sulfate (DS), a glycosaminoglycan crucial for wound healing, has unique affinity for autoantigens (autoAgs) from apoptotic cells. DS-autoAg complexes are capable of stimulating autoreactive B cells and autoantibody production. Using DS affinity, we identified an autoantigenome of 408 proteins from human fetal lung fibroblast HFL11 cells, at least 231 of which are known autoAgs. Comparing with available COVID data, 352 proteins of the autoantigenome have thus far been found to be altered at protein or RNA levels in SARS-Cov-2 infection, 210 of which are known autoAgs. The COVID-altered proteins are significantly associated with RNA metabolism, translation, vesicles and vesicle transport, cell death, supramolecular fibrils, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and interleukin signaling. They offer clues to neurological problems, fibrosis, smooth muscle dysfunction, and thrombosis. In particular, 150 altered proteins are related to the nervous system, including axon, myelin sheath, neuron projection, neuronal cell body, and olfactory bulb. An association with the melanosome is also identified. The findings from our study illustrate a strong connection between viral infection and autoimmunity. The vast number of COVID-altered proteins with propensity to become autoAgs offers an explanation for the diverse autoimmune complications in COVID patients. The variety of autoAgs related to mRNA metabolism, translation, and vesicles raises concerns about potential adverse effects of mRNA vaccines.

92,"Six-month Neurological and Psychiatric Outcomes in 236,379 Survivors of COVID-19","Background. Neurological and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 have been reported, but there are limited data on incidence rates and relative risks. Methods. Using retrospective cohort studies and time-to-event analysis, we estimated the incidence of ICD-10 diagnoses in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; Parkinsonism; Guillain-Barre syndrome; nerve/nerve root/plexus disorders; myoneural/muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders; substance misuse; and insomnia. Data were obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (over 81 million patients). We compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory infections using a Cox model. We investigated the effect on incidence estimates of COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalization and encephalopathy (including delirium and related disorders). Findings. 236,379 patients survived a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Among them, the estimated incidence of neurological or psychiatric sequelae at 6 months was 33.6%, with 12.8% receiving their first such diagnosis. Most diagnostic categories were commoner after COVID-19 than after influenza or other respiratory infections (hazard ratios from 1.21 to 5.28), including stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, dementia, and psychotic disorders. Findings were equivocal for Parkinsonism and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Amongst COVID-19 cases, incidences and hazard ratios for most disorders were higher in patients who had been hospitalized, and markedly so in those who had experienced encephalopathy. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, including comparisons against an additional four index health events. Interpretation. The study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity following COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, those who had severe COVID-19.

93,Host-directed therapies against early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 retain efficacy against B.1.1.7 variant,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and massive societal and economic burden. Recently, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, known as B.1.1.7, was first detected in the United Kingdom and is spreading in several other countries, heightening public health concern and raising questions as to the resulting effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic interventions. We and others previously identified host-directed therapies with antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Less prone to the development of therapy resistance, host-directed drugs represent promising therapeutic options to combat emerging viral variants as host genes possess a lower propensity to mutate compared to viral genes. Here, in the first study of the full-length B.1.1.7 variant virus, we find two host-directed drugs, plitidepsin (aplidin; inhibits translation elongation factor eEF1A) and ralimetinib (inhibits p38 MAP kinase cascade), as well as remdesivir, to possess similar antiviral activity against both the early-lineage SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 variant, evaluated in both human gastrointestinal and lung epithelial cell lines. We find that plitidepsin is over an order of magnitude more potent than remdesivir against both viruses.

MethodsPreliminary cross-sectional data were analysed from a cohort study (n=4,378). Clinical and non-clinical staff of three London-based NHS Trusts (UK), including acute and mental health Trusts, took part in an online baseline survey. The primary outcome measure used is the presence of probable common mental disorders (CMDs), measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Secondary outcomes are probable anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (PCL-6), suicidal ideation (CIS-R), and alcohol use (AUDIT). Moral injury is measured using the Moray Injury Event Scale (MIES).

ResultsAnalyses showed substantial levels of CMDs (58.9%, 95%CI 58.1 to 60.8), and of PTSD (30.2%, 95%CI 28.1 to 32.5) with lower levels of depression (27.3%, 95%CI 25.3 to 29.4), anxiety (23.2%, 95%CI 21.3 to 25.3), and alcohol misuse (10.5%, 95%CI, 9.2 to 11.9). Women, younger staff, and nurses tended to have poorer outcomes than other staff, except for alcohol misuse. Higher reported exposure to moral injury (distress resulting from violation of ones moral code) was strongly associated with increased levels of CMDs, anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, and alcohol misuse.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that mental health support for healthcare workers should consider those demographics and occupations at highest risk. Rigorous longitudinal data are needed in order to respond to the potential long-term mental health impacts of the pandemic.

95,Symptoms of anxiety and depression in relation to work patterns during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Philadelphia PA: a cross-sectional survey,"ObjectiveWe investigated whether patterns of work during COVID-19 pandemic altered by effort to contain the outbreak affected anxiety and depression.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 911 residents of Philadelphia, inquiring about their working lives during early months of the epidemic, symptoms of anxiety and depression, plus demographics, perceived sources of support, and general health.

ResultsOccupational contact with suspected COVID-19 cases was associated with anxiety. Concerns about return to work, childcare, lack of sick leave, and loss/reduction in work correlated with anxiety and depression, even when there was no evidence of occupational contact with infected persons; patterns differed by gender.

ConclusionsHeightened anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic can be due to widespread disruption of working lives, especially in ""non-essential"" low-income industries, on par with experience in healthcare.

The significance to clinical practice of the information being presented: Anxiety and depression symptoms that emerged during COVID-19 pandemic may be related to disruption of working lives even among people who are not the ""essential"" workers with one-one-one contact with infected persons.

96,Exploring support needs of people living with diabetes during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic: insights from a UK survey.,"BackgroundThe coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has radically compromised healthcare for people living with chronic conditions such as diabetes. Government-imposed restrictions to contain the spread of the virus has forced people to suddenly adjust their lifestyle. This study aimed to capture the impact of the pandemic on people living with diabetes and the views of these individuals on ways in which the information, advice and support they are receiving could be improved.

Research design and methodsAn online anonymous survey was distributed across the UK during the first lockdown and initial easing. The survey comprised questions about confidence in diabetes self-management, resources used to obtain information, advice and support, and opinions on how these could be improved. Open-ended captured subjective experiences.

ResultsThe survey was completed by 773 adults living with diabetes (69.2% type 1, 28.5% type 2). There was notable variability in the impact of the pandemic on confidence in self-management, with confidence having deteriorated most commonly in the ability to take care of own mental wellbeing (37.0% respondents) and improved most commonly in maintaining a healthy weight (21.1% respondents). 41.2% of respondents living alone reported not receiving any outside support. The quality of information, advice and support received from the healthcare team was rated poorly by 37.2%. Respondents sought greater communication and tailored advice from their care team, clear and consistent information from the government and news channels, and improved understanding of diabetes and its challenges from their personal networks and employers.

ConclusionAdjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the mental health and wellbeing of people living with diabetes. Diabetes care teams must receive assistance to support these individuals without risking further inequalities in access to healthcare. Equipping personal networks and employers with knowledge on diabetes and skills to support self-management may reduce the burden on the NHS.

O_TEXTBOXSignificance of this study

O_LIWhat is already known about this subject?
O_LIThe COVID-19 pandemic has posed multiple challenges to the everyday life of people across the world.
C_LIO_LIPeople living with diabetes mellitus, particularly those with poor blood glucose are more vulnerable to developing the severe outcomes of COVID-19.
C_LIO_LINHS prioritisation of COVID-19 has disrupted the availability of care for patients with chronic health conditions, including diabetes mellitus.
C_LI
C_LIO_LIWhat are the new findings?
O_LIThe pandemic generated a decrease in confidence in diabetes self-management, particularly regarding mental wellbeing (37.0%) and adhering to physical activity recommendations (32.0%) and a healthy eating pattern (29.6%). Greater access to the healthcare team and services, strategies to adjust self-care (with greater focus on mental health) and more external support are deemed as important to reinstate diabetes self-management.
C_LIO_LICancellation of appointments reduced patients access to knowledge on their glucose control and their confidence in diabetes self-management, it generated difficulties in switching between treatments and resulted in impoverished mental health and motivation to self-manage.
C_LIO_LI41.2% of respondents living alone report not receiving support from outside their household.
C_LIO_LIQuality of information, advice and support received from the government and healthcare teams were perceived most poorly (% of respondents giving a rating of poor or very poor: 39.0% and 37.2% respectively). There is a request for greater transparency, higher quality information, improved contact, and an increased understanding of the condition by others.
C_LI
C_LIO_LIHow might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?
O_LIThere is a need to ensure equitable contact between healthcare teams and their patients, both for diabetes self-management and overall wellbeing.
C_LIO_LIA shift to remote consultations should include training practitioners to detect emotional distress in patients and the ability to refer patients to NHS or community-led mental health support.
C_LIO_LIA collective effort is needed to produce more stratified and consistent guidance, with clear messaging to minimise uncertainty and distress.
C_LIO_LIFurther research and policy are needed to help patients identify a support network outside their direct care team and equip them with the knowledge and skills to provide adequate support.
C_LIO_LIGreater understanding on how some individuals were able to adjust their self-management successfully could assist care teams, relevant charities and policy makers to provide better support for those individuals who are struggling.

97,Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases or outbreaks at nursing homes by targeted wastewater tracking,"ObjectivesNear-source tracking of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the sewage drains serving particular buildings may allow rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases or local outbreaks. In this pilot study, we investigated whether this was the case for nursing homes (NH).

MethodsThe study involved five NH (from A to E) affiliated to the Clinico-Malvarrosa Health Department, Valencia (Spain). These were nursing or mixed nursing/care homes of different sizes, altogether providing care for 472 residents attended by a staff of 309. Near-source sewage samples were screened for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR at least 5 days per week during the study period. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff was performed with the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA).

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in wastewater samples from four of the five NH. SARS-CoV-2 infection cases were documented in three of these four NH. Of the two NH without SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in sewer samples from one facility, while it was repeatedly detected in samples from the other. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage preceded identification of isolated cases among residents or staff or outbreak declaration in two NH, with lag times ranging from 5 to 19 days.

ConclusionOur study demonstrated that intermittent or persistent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NH sewers can provide an early warning of subsequent individual cases or outbreaks in these facilities.",Laura Davo; Raimundo Segui; Pilar Botija; Maria Jose Beltran; Eliseo Albert; Ignacio Torres; Pablo Angel Lopez-Fernandez; Rafael Orti; Juan Francisco Maestre; Gloria Sanchez; David Navarro,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249640,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21249640,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,,True
98,REACT-1 round 8 interim report: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during the initial stages of the third national lockdown in England,"BackgroundHigh prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in many northern hemisphere populations is causing extreme pressure on healthcare services and leading to high numbers of fatalities. Even though safe and effective vaccines are being deployed in many populations, the majority of those most at-risk of severe COVID-19 will not be protected until late spring, even in countries already at a more advanced stage of vaccine deployment.

MethodsThe REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission study-1 (REACT-1) obtains throat and nose swabs from between 120,000 and 180,000 people in the community in England at approximately monthly intervals. Round 8a of REACT-1 mainly covers a period from 6th January 2021 to 15th January 2021. Swabs are tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus and patterns of swab-positivity are described over time, space and with respect to individual characteristics. We compare swab-positivity prevalence from REACT-1 with mobility data based on the GPS locations of individuals using the Facebook mobile phone app. We also compare results from round 8a with those from round 7 in which swabs were collected from 13th November to 24th November (round 7a) and 25th November to 3rd December 2020 (round 7b).

ResultsIn round 8a, we found 1,962 positives from 142,909 swabs giving a weighted prevalence of 1.58% (95% CI, 1.49%, 1.68%). Using a constant growth model, we found no strong evidence for either growth or decay averaged across the period; rather, based on data from a limited number of days, prevalence may have started to rise at the end of round 8a. Facebook mobility data showed a marked decrease in activity at the end of December 2020, followed by a rise at the start of the working year in January 2021. Between round 7b and round 8a, prevalence increased in all adult age groups, more than doubling to 0.94% (0.83%, 1.07%) in those aged 65 and over. Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Black and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence. Both healthcare and care home workers, and other key workers, had increased odds of swab-positivity compared to other workers.

ConclusionDuring the initial 10 days of the third COVID-19 lockdown in England in January 2021, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was very high with no evidence of decline. Until prevalence in the community is reduced substantially, health services will remain under extreme pressure and the cumulative number of lives lost during this pandemic will continue to increase rapidly.",Steven Riley; Kylie E.

99,Redeployment and training of healthcare professionals to Intensive Care during COVID-19: a systemic review,"BackgroundA rapid influx of patients to intensive care and infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic required the rapid development of innovative redeployment and training strategies.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic search of 9 databases including key terms related to intensive care AND training AND redeployment AND healthcare workers. Analysis consisted of a narrative synthesis of quantitative study outputs, and a framework-based thematic analysis of qualitative study outputs and grey literature. These results were then combined applying an interpretative synthesis.

ResultsTwenty papers were analysed. These took place primarily in the UK (N=8, 40%) and USA (N=5, 25%). Themes included in the results are Redeployment: Implementation strategies and learnings; Redeployed staff experience and strategies to address their needs; Redeployed staff learning needs; Training formats offered and training evaluations; and Future redeployment and training concerns.

Some of the redeployment implementation and training strategies documented in this review are: Skills-based redeployment, buddy support systems, and agreeing on locally-specific principles, rather than strict procedures.

100,Clinical prediction rule for SARS-CoV-2 infection from 116 U.S. emergency departments,"ObjectivesAccurate and reliable criteria to rapidly estimate the probability of infection with the novel coronavirus-2 that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and associated disease (COVID-19) remain an urgent unmet need, especially in emergency care. The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care.

MethodsData came from the Registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical predictors and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction rule was derived from a 50% random sample (n=9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables.

ResultsMultivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to 13-point rule: +1 point each for age>50 years, measured temperature>37.5{degrees}C, oxygen saturation<95%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n=9,975), the score produced an area under the receiver operating character curve of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified rule, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6% (94.8-96.3%), specificity of 20.0% (19.0-21.0%), likelihood ratio negative of 0.22 (0.19-0.26). Increasing points on the simplified rule predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., >75% probability with +5 or more points).

ConclusionCriteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decision about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.

101,Clinical effectiveness of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Given the variability of previously reported results, this systematic review aims to determine the clinical effectiveness of convalescent plasma employed in the treatment of hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19.

We conducted a systematic review of controlled clinical trials assessing treatment with convalescent plasma for hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, and ventilation requirement.

A total of 50 studies were retrieved from the databases. Four articles were finally included in the data extraction, qualitative and quantitative synthesis of results. The meta-analysis suggests that there is no benefit of convalescent plasma compared to standard care or placebo in the reduction of the overall mortality and in the ventilation requirement; but there could be a benefit for the clinical improvement in patients treated with plasma.

We can conclude that the convalescent plasma transfusion cannot reduce the mortality or ventilation requirement in hospitalized patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Because this is a rapidly evolving situation, our goal was to explore potential risk factors and trends in feelings of anxiety and depression among the general population in Canada over the first five months of the pandemic.

MO_SCPLOWETHODSC_SCPLOWWe completed on-line surveys of 3,127 unique individuals representative of the Canadian general population at 4 discreet periods every 6 weeks from April 15th to July 28th 2020. We assessed feelings of anxiety, depression and loss of interest with the interRAI self-reported mood scale using a multivariable generalized estimating equation model to examine factors associated with having a 5+ score on the scale (indicating potentially depressed mood). We also investigated potential longitudinal trends to examine temporal changes in mood scores.

RO_SCPLOWESULTSC_SCPLOWMore than 30% of participants felt highly anxious, depressed, and disinterested in everyday activities in the first survey (April), but this number decreased to about 20% over 4 months. Feeling lonely, younger age, feeling overwhelmed by ones health needs, having financial concerns, and living outside of Quebec were significantly associated with depressed mood.

Identifying risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity could help to direct these efforts.

ObjectiveTo estimate the associations between demographic factors and social behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test.

MethodsIn September 2020, we randomly sampled Indiana University Bloomington (IUB) undergraduate students. Participants completed a cross-sectional, online survey about demographics, SARS-CoV-2 testing history, relationship status, and risk behaviors. Additionally, during a subsequent appointment, participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a fingerstick procedure and SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit. We used unadjusted modified Poisson regression models to evaluate the associations between predictors of both SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 infection history.

ResultsOverall, 1,076 students were included in the serological testing analysis, and 1,239 students were included in the SARS-CoV-2 infection history analysis. Current seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.6% (95% CI: 3.3%, 5.8%). Prevalence of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection history was 10.3% (95% CI: 8.6%, 12.0%). Greek membership, having multiple romantic partners, knowing someone in ones immediate environment with SARS-CoV-2 infection, drinking alcohol more than 1 day per week, and hanging out with more than 4 people when drinking alcohol increased both the likelihood of seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection history.

104,Simulating the impact of different vaccination policies on the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City,"PurposeTo analyze potential COVID-19 epidemic outcomes in New York City under different SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation scenarios and vaccine rollout policies from early Jan 2021 to end of June 2021.

Key findingsIn anticipation of the potential arrival and dominance of the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant:

O_LIMass-vaccination would be critical to mitigating epidemic severity (26-52% reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to no vaccination, provided the new UK variant supplants currently circulating variants).
C_LIO_LIPrioritizing key risk groups for earlier vaccination would lead to greater reductions in hospitalizations and deaths than infections. Thus, in general this would be a good strategy.
C_LIO_LICurrent vaccination prioritization policy is suboptimal. To avert more hospitalizations and deaths, mass-vaccination of all individuals 65 years or older should be done as soon as possible. For groups listed in the same phase, 65+ year-olds should be given first priority ahead of others.
C_LIO_LIAvailable vaccine doses should be given to the next priority groups as soon as possible without awaiting hesitant up-stream groups.
C_LIO_LIWhile efficacy of vaccination off-protocol is unknown, provided immune response following a first vaccine dose persists, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose by [~]1 month (i.e. administer the two doses 8 weeks apart) can substantially reduce infections, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to the 3-week apart regimen. Across all scenarios tested here, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose leads to the largest reduction in severe epidemic outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and deaths). Therefore, to protect as many people as possible, this strategy should be considered if rapid increases in infections, hospitalization or deaths and/or shortages in vaccines were to occur.

105,"Excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among Californians 18-65 years of age, by occupational sector and occupation: March through October 2020","BackgroundThough SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been documented in occupational settings and though there is speculation that essential workers face heightened risks for COVID-19, occupational differences in excess mortality have, to date, not been examined. Such information could point to opportunities for intervention, such as workplace modifications and prioritization of vaccine distribution.

Methods and findingsUsing death records from the California Department of Public Health, we estimated excess mortality among Californians 18-65 years of age by occupational sector and occupation, with additional stratification of the sector analysis by race/ethnicity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, working age adults experienced a 22% increase in mortality compared to historical periods. Relative excess mortality was highest in food/agriculture workers (39% increase), transportation/logistics workers (28% increase), facilities (27%) and manufacturing workers (23% increase). Latino Californians experienced a 36% increase in mortality, with a 59% increase among Latino food/agriculture workers. Black Californians experienced a 28% increase in mortality, with a 36% increase for Black retail workers. Asian Californians experienced an 18% increase, with a 40% increase among Asian healthcare workers. Excess mortality among White working-age Californians increased by 6%, with a 16% increase among White food/agriculture workers.

ConclusionsCertain occupational sectors have been associated with high excess mortality during the pandemic, particularly among racial and ethnic groups also disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In-person essential work is a likely venue of transmission of coronavirus infection and must be addressed through strict enforcement of health orders in workplace settings and protection of in-person workers.

106,Potential contribution of climate conditions on COVID-19 pandemic transmission over West and North African countries,"The COVID-19 disease, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a very contagious disease that has killed many people around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, the spread of the disease appears to be slower in Africa. Although a number of studies have been published on the relationship between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 transmission, the effects of climate conditions on COVID-19 remain largely unexplored and without consensus following the main research finding over Africa (often based on a single country or city). Here, using available epidemiological data over 275 days (i.e., from March 1 to November 30, 2020) taken from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control of the European Union database and daily data of surface air temperature and humidity from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), this paper investigates the potential contributions of climate conditions on COVID-19 transmission over 16 countries selected from three bioclimatic regions of Africa (i.e., Sahel, Maghreb and Gulf of Guinea). On average, our main findings highlight statistically significant inverse correlations between COVID-19 cases and temperature over the Maghreb and the Gulf of Guinea regions, whereas positive correlations are found in the Sahel, especially over the central part including Niger and Mali. Correlations with specific humidity and water vapor parameters display significant and positive values over the Sahelian and the Gulf of Guinean countries and negative values over the Maghreb countries. In other word, results imply that the COVID-19 pandemic transmission is influenced differently across the three bioclimatic regions: i) cold and dry environmental conditions over the Maghreb; ii) warm and humid conditions over the Sahel iii) cold and humid conditions over the Gulf of Guinea.

Unfortunately, there are substantial concerns about the strength and quality of the literature examining policy impacts. This study systematically assessed the currently published COVID-19 policy impact literature for a checklist of study design elements and methodological issues. Methods: We included studies that were primarily designed to estimate the quantitative impact of one or more implemented COVID-19 policies on direct SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 outcomes. After searching PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published on November 26 or earlier and screening, all studies were reviewed by three reviewers independently and in consensus. The review tool was based on review guidance for assessing COVID-19 health policy impact evaluation analyses, including first identifying the assumptions behind the methods used, followed by assessing graphical display of outcomes data, functional form for the outcomes, timing between policy and impact, concurrent changes to the outcomes, and an overall rating. Results: After 102 articles were identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria, we identified 36 published articles that evaluated the quantitative impact of COVID-19 policies on direct COVID-19 outcomes. The majority (n=23/36) of studies in our sample examined the impact of stay-at-home requirements. Nine studies were set aside due to the study design being considered inappropriate for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation (n=8 pre/post; n=1 cross-section), and 27 articles were given a full consensus assessment. 20/27 met criteria for graphical display of data, 5/27 for functional form, 19/27 for timing between policy implementation and impact, and only 3/27 for concurrent changes to the outcomes. Only 1/27 studies passed all of the above checks, and 4/27 were rated as overall appropriate. Including the 9 studies set aside, we found that only four (or by a stricter standard, only one) of the 36 identified published and peer-reviewed health policy impact evaluation studies passed a set of key design checks for identifying the causal impact of policies on COVID-19 outcomes. Discussion: The current literature directly evaluating the impact of COVID-19 policies largely fails to meet key design criteria for useful inference. This may be partially due to the circumstances for evaluation being particularly difficult, as well as a context with desire for rapid publication, the importance of the topic, and weak peer review processes. Importantly, weak evidence is non-informative and does not indicate how effective these policies were on COVID-19 outcomes.",Noah A Haber; Emma Clarke-Deelder; Avi Feller; Emily R Smith; Joshua Salomon; Benjamin MacCormack-Gelles; Elizabeth M Stone; Clara Bolster-Foucault; Jamie R Daw; Laura A Hatfield; Carrie E Fry; Christopher B Boyer; Eli Ben-Michael; Caroline M Joyce; Beth S Linas; Ian Schmid; Eric H Au; Sarah E Wieten; Brooke A Jarrett; Cathrine Axfors; Van Thu Nguyen; Beth Ann Griffin; Alyssa Bilinski; Elizabeth A Stuart,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250243,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250243,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,,True
108,Assessing the efficacy of interventions to control indoor SARS-Cov-2 transmission: an agent-based modeling approach,"Intervention strategies for minimizing indoor SARS-CoV-2 transmission are often based on anecdotal evidence because there is little evidence-based research to support them. We developed a spatially-explicit agent-based model for simulating indoor respiratory pathogen transmission, and used it to compare effects of four interventions on reducing individual-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk by simulating a well-known case study. We found that imposing movement restrictions and efficacious mask usage appear to have the greatest effects on reducing infection risk, but multiple concurrent interventions are required to minimize the proportion of susceptible individuals infected. Social distancing had little effect on reducing transmission if individuals move during the gathering. Furthermore, our results suggest that there is potential for ventilation airflow to expose susceptible people to aerosolized pathogens even if they are relatively far from infectious individuals. Maximizing rates of aerosol removal is the key to successful transmission-risk reduction when using ventilation systems as intervention tools.

Article Summary LineImposing mask usage requirements, group size restrictions, duration limits, and social distancing policies can have additive, and in some cases multiplicative protective effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk during indoor events.",Trevor S Farthing; Cristina Lanzas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250240,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250240,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,,True
109,Do Pandemics Obey the Elliott Wave Principle of Financial Markets?,"The Elliott Wave principle is a time-honored, oft-used method for predicting variations in the financial markets. It is based on the notion that human emotions drive financial decisions. In the fight against COVID-19, human emotions are similarly decisive, for instance in that they determine ones willingness to be vaccinated, and/or to follow preventive measures including the wearing of masks, the application of social distancing protocols, and frequent handwashing. On this basis, we postulated that the Elliott Wave Principle may similarly be used to predict the future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrated that this method reproduces the data pattern especially well for USA (daily new cases). Potential scenarios were then extrapolated, from the best-case corresponding to a rapid, full vaccination of the population, to the utterly disastrous case of slow vaccination, and poor adherence to preventive protocols.",Prashant Dogra; Eugene J.

We validate our model on data from influenza A as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection data for Macaque monkeys and humans. Further, we compare the virus load function to an established target model of virus dynamics, which shows an excellent fit.

111,Development and validation of a predictive model for critical illness in adult patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19,"BackgroundIdentifying factors that can predict severe disease in patients needing hospitalization for COVID-19 is crucial for early recognition of patients at greatest risk.

Objective1) Identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and (2) develop a simple calculator for clinicians managing patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

MethodsA total of 2,685 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a large metropolitan health system in Georgia, USA between March and July 2020 were included in the study. Seventy-five percent of patients were included in the training dataset (admitted March 1 to July 10). Through multivariable logistic regression, we developed a prediction model (probability score) for ICU transfer. Then, we validated the model by estimating its performance accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) using data from the remaining 25% of patients (admitted July 11 to July 31).

ResultsWe included 2,014 and 671 patients in the training and validation datasets, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, serum C-reactive protein, and serum lactate dehydrogenase were identified as significant risk factors for ICU transfer, and a prediction model was developed. The AUC was 0.752 for the training dataset and 0.769 for the validation dataset. We developed a free, web-based calculator to facilitate use of the prediction model (https://icucovid19.shinyapps.io/ICUCOVID19/).

ConclusionOur validated, simple, and accessible prediction model and web-based calculator for ICU transfer may be useful in assisting healthcare providers in identifying hospitalized patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk for clinical deterioration.

112,Using body temperature and variables commonly available in the EHR to predict acute infection: A proof-of-concept study showing improved pretest probability estimates for acute COVID-19 infection among discharged emergency department patients,"ObjectivesObtaining body temperature is a quick and easy method to screen for acute infection such as COVID-19. Currently, the predictive value of body temperature for acute infection is inhibited by failure to account for other readily available variables that affect temperature values. In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to improve COVID-19 pretest probability estimation by incorporating covariates known to be associated with body temperature, including patient age, sex, comorbidities, month, time of day.

MethodsFor patients discharged from an academic hospital emergency department after testing for COVID-19 in March and April of 2020, we abstracted clinical data. We reviewed physician documentation to retrospectively generate estimates of pretest probability for COVID-19. Using patients COVID-19 PCR test results as a gold standard, we compared AUCs of logistic regression models predicting COVID-19 positivity that used: 1) body temperature alone; 2) body temperature and pretest probability; 3) body temperature, pretest probability, and body temperature-relevant covariates. Calibration plots and bootstrap validation were used to assess predictive performance for model #3.

ResultsData from 117 patients were included. The models AUCs were: 1) 0.69 2) 0.72, and 3) 0.76, respectively. The absolute difference in AUC was 0.029 (95%CI -0.057 to 0.114, p=0.25) between model 2 and 1 and 0.038 (95%CI -0.021 to 0.097, p=0.10) between model 3 and 2.

ConclusionsBy incorporating covariates known to affect body temperature, we demonstrated improved pretest probability estimates of acute COVID-19 infection.

113,Abrupt increase in the UK coronavirus death-case ratio in December 2020,"1Objectiveto determine the statistical relationship between reported deaths and infections in the UK coronavirus outbreak

DesignPublicly available UK government data is used to determine a relationship between reported cases and deaths, taking into account various UK regions, age profiles and prevalence of the variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7.

Main Outcome MeasuresEstablishing a simple statistical relationship between detected cases and subsequent mortality.

ResultsThroughout October and November 2020, deaths in England are well described as 1/55th of detected cases from 12 days previously. After that, the relationship no longer holds and deaths are significantly higher. This is especially true in regions affected by the VOC B.1.1.7

ConclusionsIn early December, some new factor emerged to increase the case-fatality rate in the UK.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSThe infection-mortality ratio enables one to predict future deaths based on current infections. Incomplete monitoring of infection may be sufficient to predict future trends.

What the study addsFor the specific case of the second wave of coronavirus infection in the UK, we show a clear mathematical relationship between detected infections (positive tests) and subsequent deaths. This relationship begins to fail in December, with unexpectedly high death rates. This may be correlated in time and region with the emergence of the Variant of Concern B 1.1.7.",David J Wallace; Graeme J Ackland,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250264,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250264,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,,True
114,Theoretical framework for retrospective studies of the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,"Observational studies of the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are needed to inform real-world use. These are now in planning amid the ongoing rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines globally. While traditional case-control (TCC) and test-negative design (TND) studies feature prominently among strategies used to assess vaccine effectiveness, such studies may encounter important threats to validity. Here we review the theoretical basis for estimation of vaccine direct effects under TCC and TND frameworks, addressing specific natural history parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 relevant to these designs. Bias may be introduced by misclassification of cases and controls, particularly when clinical case criteria include common, non-specific indicators of COVID-19. When using diagnostic assays with high analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, individuals testing positive may be counted as cases even if their symptoms are due to other causes. The TCC may be particularly prone to confounding due to associations of vaccination with healthcare-seeking behavior or risk of infection. The TND reduces but may not eliminate this confounding, for instance if individuals who receive vaccination seek care or testing for less-severe infection. These circumstances indicate the two study designs cannot be applied naively to datasets gathered through public health surveillance or administrative sources. We suggest practical strategies to reduce bias in vaccine effectiveness estimates at the study design and analysis stages.",Joseph A Lewnard; Manish M Patel; Nicholas P Jewell; Jennifer R Verani; Miwako Kobayashi; Mark Tenforde; Natalie E Dean; Benjamin J Cowling; Benjamin A Lopman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250258,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250258,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,,True
115,Agent-Based Simulation of Covid-19 Vaccination Policies in CovidSIMVL,"An agent-based infectious disease modeling tool (CovidSIMVL) is employed in this paper to explore outcomes associated with MRNA two-dose vaccination regimens set out in Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) documents submitted by Pfizer and Moderna to the US Department of Health & Human Services. As well, the paper explores outcomes associated with a third ""Hybrid"" policy that reflects ranges of expected levels of protection according to Pfizer and Moderna EUAs, but entails a 35 day separation between first and second dose, which exceeds the 21 days set out in Pfizer documentation or the 28 days in Moderna documentation.

Four CovidSIMVL parameters are varied in the course of 75 simulated clinical trials. Two relate directly to the vaccines and their impacts (duration between doses; degree of expected protection conferred by different vaccines following first or second dose). Two relate to the simulation contexts to which the vaccines are applied (degree of infectivity; duration of infectivity). The simulated trials demonstrate expected effects for timing of second dose, and for degree of protection associated with first and second dose of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and the effects are consistent with an assumed value of 75% for degree of protection after first and second doses for the Hybrid vaccine. However, the simulated trials suggest a more complex interaction between expected level of protection following first dose, timing of second dose and degree of infectivity. These results suggest that policy options should not be considered independent of the transmission dynamics that are manifested in the contexts in which the policies could be applied.

CovidSIMVL embodies stochasticity in the mechanisms that govern viral transmission, and it treats the basic reproduction number (R0)as an emergent characteristic of transmission dynamics, not as a pre-set value that determines those dynamics. As such, results reported in this paper reflect outcomes that could happen, but do not necessarily reflect what is more or less likely to happen, given different configurations of parameters. The discussion section goes into some measure of detail regarding next steps that could be pursued to enhance the potential for agent-based models such as CovidSIMVL to inform exploration of possible vaccination policies, and to project outcomes that are possible or likely in local contexts, where stochasticity and heterogeneity of transmission must be featured in models that are intended to reflect local realism.",Ernie Chang; Kenneth Andrew Moselle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250237,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250237,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,,True

ObjectTo evaluate COVID-19 effects precisely, we specifically examine deaths caused by pneumonia and examine excess mortality attributable to pneumonia in Japan.

MethodWe applied the NIID model to pneumonia deaths from 2005 up through August, 2020 for the whole of Japan. Introduction of routine pneumococcal vaccination for elderly people and revision in ICD10 were incorporated into the estimation model. Results: No excess mortality was found for 2020. However, negative excess mortality was observed as 178 in May, 314 in June, and 75 in July.

This study evaluated the protection offered by eighteen fabric masks designs. In addition, it assessed the benefit of including three design features: insert filters, surgical mask underlayers, and nose wires.

MethodsQuantitative fit tests were conducted on different masks and with some additional design features. An array of fabric masks were tested on a single participant to account for variability in face shapes. The effects of insert filters, surgical mask underlayers and nose wires were also assessed.

ResultsAs expected, the fabric masks offered low degrees of protection; however, alterations in design showed significant increase in their protective ability. The most effective designs were multi-layered masks that fit tightly to the face and lacked dead space between the user and mask. Also, low air-resistance insert filters and surgical mask underlays provided the greatest increase in protection.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThis was a retrospective observational study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to Huo-Shen-Shan Hospital, Wuhan, China. The hospital was built only for treating COVID-19 and opened on February 5, 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during hospitalization.

RESULTSAmong 2877 hospitalized patients, 13.5% (387/2877) had a history of diabetes and 1.9% (56/2877) died in hospital. After adjustment for confounders, patients with diabetes had a 2-fold increase in the hazard of mortality as compared to patients without diabetes (adjusted HR 2.11, 95%CI: 1.16-3.83, P=0.014). The on-admission glucose (per mmol/L[&ge;]4mmol/L) was significantly associated with subsequent mortality on COVID-19 (adjusted HR 1.17, 95%CI: 1.10-1.24, P<0.001).

We developed a bispecific, IgG1-like molecule based on two antibodies derived from COVID-19 convalescent donors, C121 and C1353. CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, completely prevents S binding to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus cellular receptor. Furthermore, CoV-X2 recognizes a broad panel of RBD variants and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and the escape mutants generated by the single monoclonals at sub-nanomolar concentrations. In a novel model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, combining into a single molecule the advantages of antibody cocktails.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.427567,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.427567,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,,False

Two SARS-CoV-2 variants, N501Y.V1 (also known as B.1.1.7 lineage or VOC-202012/01) and N501Y.V2 (B.1.351 lineage), reported from the United Kingdom and South Africa, contain several mutations in the receptor binding domain of Spike and are of particular concern. To address the infectivity and neutralization escape phenotypes potentially caused by these mutations, we used SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system to compare the viral infectivity, as well as the neutralization activities of convalescent sera and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results showed that N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 increase viral infectivity compared to the reference strain (wild-type, WT) in vitro. At 8 months after symptom onset, 17 serum samples of 20 participants (85%) retaining titers of ID50 >40 against WT pseudovirus, whereas the NAb titers of 8 samples (40%) and 18 samples (90%) decreased below the threshold against N501Y.V1 and N501Y.V2, respectively. In addition, both N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 reduced neutralization sensitivity to most (6/8) mAbs tested, while N501Y.V2 even abrogated neutralizing activity of two mAbs.

126,Exploring the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2,"The lack of an identifiable intermediate host species for the proximal animal ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and the distance ([~]1500 km) from Wuhan to Yunnan province, where the closest evolutionary related coronaviruses circulating in horseshoe bats have been identified, is fueling speculation on the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2. Here we analyse SARS-CoV-2s related horseshoe bat and pangolin Sarbecoviruses and confirm Rhinolophus affinis continues to be the likely reservoir species as its host range extends across Central and Southern China. This would explain the bat Sarbecovirus recombinants in the West and East China, trafficked pangolin infections and bat Sarbecovirus recombinants linked to Southern China. Recent ecological disturbances as a result of changes in meat consumption could then explain SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans through direct or indirect contact with the reservoir wildlife, and subsequent emergence towards Hubei in Central China. The only way, however, of finding the animal progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the whereabouts of its close relatives, very likely capable of posing a similar threat of emergence in the human population and other animals, will be by increasing the intensity of our sampling.",Spyros Lytras; Joseph Hughes; Wei Xia; Xiaowei Jiang; David L Robertson,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.427830,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.427830,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,,False
127,"Changes in healthcare workers' knowledge, attitudes, practices, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic","IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented health crisis around the world, not least because of its heterogeneous clinical presentation and course. The new information on the pandemic emerging daily has made it challenging for healthcare workers (HCWs) to stay current with the latest knowledge, which could influence their attitudes and practices during patient care.

MethodsThis study is a follow-up evaluation of changes in HCWs knowledge, attitudes, and practices as well as anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Data were collected through an anonymous, predesigned, self-administered questionnaire that was sent online to HCWs in Saudi Arabia.

ResultsThe questionnaire was sent to 1500 HCWs, with a 63.8% response rate (N=957). The majority of respondents were female (83%), and the most common age group was 31-40 years (52.2%). Nurses constituted 86.3% of the respondents. HCWs reported higher anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic which increased from 4.91{+/-}2.84 to 8.6{+/-}2.27 on an 11-point Likert scale compared to other viral outbreaks. HCWs believed that their own preparedness as well as that of their hospitals intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency room (ER) was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic (2012-2015). About 58% of HCWs attended one or more simulations concerning the management of COVID-19 patients in their ICU/ER, and nearly all had undergone N95 mask fit testing. The mean score of HCWs knowledge of COVID-19 was 9.89/12. For most respondents (94.6%), the perception of being at increased risk of infection was the main cause of anxiety related to COVID-19; the mean score of anxiety over COVID-19 increased from 4.91{+/-}2.84 before to 8.6{+/-}2.27 during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia.

ConclusionsHCWs anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 have increased since a pandemic was declared.

128,SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage-related perceptions and travel worry among healthcare workers,"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) travel-related anxiety needs to be assessed in light of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations.

MethodsAn online, cross-sectional questionnaire among HCWs between December 21, 2020 to January 7, 2021. The outcome variables were HCWs knowledge and awareness of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage, and its associated travel worry and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score.

ResultsA total of 1,058 HCWs completed the survey; 66.5% were female, 59.0% were nurses. 9.0% indicated they had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 themselves. Regarding the B.1.1.7 lineage, almost all (97.3%) were aware of its emergence, 73.8% were aware that it is more infectious, 78.0% thought it causes more severe disease, and only 50.0% knew that current COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing it. Despite this, 66.7% of HCWs were not registered to receive the vaccine. HCWs most common source of information about the new variant was social media platforms (67%), and this subgroup was significantly more worried about travelling. Nurses were more worried than physicians (P=0.001); additionally, those who had not travelled in the previous 3 months and those who had not received or registered for the COVID-19 vaccine were also significantly more worried (P = 0.037 and P < 0.001, respectively).

ConclusionsMost HCWs were aware of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and expressed substantial travel worries. Increased worry levels were found among HCWs who used social media as their main source of information, those with lower levels of COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and those with higher GAD-7 scores. Utilization of official social media platforms could improve accurate information dissemination among HCWs regarding the pandemics evolving mutations. Targeted vaccine campaigns are warranted to assure HCWs about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines toward SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Mohamad-Hani Temsah; Mazin Barry; Fadi Aljamaan; Abdullah N Alhuzaimi; Ayman Al-Eyadhy; Basema Saddik; Fahad Alsohime; Ali Alhaboob; Khalid Alhasan; Ali Alaraj; Rabih Halwani; Amr Jamal; Nurah Alamro; Reem Temsah; Shelaweeh Alanazi; Fahad Alzamil; Ali Alsomaily; Jafar A.

129,"Association between COVID-19 Outcomes and Mask Mandates, Adherence, and Attitudes","Using publicly available data, we quantify the impact of mask adherence and mask mandates on COVID-19 outcomes. We show that mask mandates are associated with a statistically significant decrease in daily new cases (-3.24 per 100K), deaths (-0.19 per 100K), and the proportion of hospital admissions (-2.47%) due to COVID-19 between February 1 and September 27, 2020. These effects are large, corresponding to 13% of the highest recorded number of cases, 20% of deaths, and 7% of admission proportion. We also find that mask mandates are linked to a 23.4 percentage point increase in mask adherence in four diverse states, and that mask adherence is associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes. Lastly, using a large novel survey in 68 countries, we find that community mask adherence and attitudes towards masks are associated with a reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

130,Evaluating the Long-Term Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccines,"AbstractLarge-scale deployment of safe and durably effective vaccines can halt the COVID-19 pandemic.1-3 However, the high vaccine efficacy reported by ongoing phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials is based on a median follow-up time of only about two months4-5 and thus does not pertain to long-term efficacy. To evaluate the duration of protection while allowing trial participants timely access to efficacious vaccine, investigators can sequentially cross placebo recipients to the vaccine arm according to priority groups. Here, we show how to estimate potentially time-varying placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy in this type of staggered vaccination of placebo recipients. In addition, we compare the performance of blinded and unblinded crossover designs in estimating long-term vaccine efficacy.

131,Evidence of ongoing recombination in SARS-CoV-2 through genealogical reconstruction,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe evolutionary process of genetic recombination has the potential to rapidly change the properties of a viral pathogen, and its presence is a crucial factor to consider in the development of treatments and vaccines. It can also significantly affect the results of phylogenetic analyses and the inference of evolutionary rates. The detection of recombination from samples of sequencing data is a very challenging problem, and is further complicated for SARS-CoV-2 by its relatively slow accumulation of genetic diversity. The extent to which recombination is ongoing for SARS-CoV-2 is not yet resolved. To address this, we use a parsimony-based method to reconstruct possible genealogical histories for samples of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which enables the analysis of recombination events that could have generated the data. We propose a framework for disentangling the effects of recurrent mutation from recombination in the history of a sample, and hence provide a way of estimating the probability that ongoing recombination is present. We apply this to samples of sequencing data collected in England and in South Africa, and find compelling evidence of ongoing recombination.",Anastasia Ignatieva; Jotun Hein; Paul A Jenkins,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.427579,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.427579,2021-01-21,2021-01-21,,False

Analysing the currently available 208911 SARS-CoV2 genome sequences (as accessed on 28 Dec 2020), we generate an extensive database of sample- wise variants and clade annotation, which forms the core of the SARS-CoV-2 analysis module of the analysis pipeline. A comparative account of lineage-specific mutations in the newer SARS-CoV-2 strains emerging in the UK, South Africa and Brazil along with data reported from India identify overlapping and lineages specific acquired mutations suggesting a repetitive convergent and adaptive evolution. Thus, the persistence of pandemic may lead to the emergence of newer regional strains with improved fitness.

133,In vitro infection of human lung tissue with SARS-CoV-2: Heterogeneity in host defense and therapeutic response,"Cell lines are the mainstay in understanding the biology of COVID-19 infection, but do not recapitulate many of the complexities of human infection. The use of human lung tissue is one solution for the study of such novel respiratory pathogens. We hypothesized that a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissue allows for the in vitro study of the inter-individual heterogeneity of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus providing a bridge between studies with cell lines and studies in animal models. We generated a cryobank of tissues from 16 donors, most of whom had risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19. Cryopreserved tissues preserved 90% of cell viability and contained heterogeneous populations of metabolically active epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell subsets of the human lung. Samples were readily infectible with HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, and demonstrated comparable susceptibility to infection. In contrast, we observed a marked donor-dependent heterogeneity in the expression of IL-6, CXCL8 and IFN{beta} in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treatment of tissues with dexamethasone and the experimental drug, N-hydroxycytidine, suppressed viral growth in all samples, whereas chloroquine and remdesivir had no detectable effect. Metformin and sirolimus, molecules with predicted antiviral activity, suppressed viral replication in tissues from a subset of donors. In summary, we developed a novel system for the in vitro study of human SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human lung tissue from a library of donor tissues. This model may be useful for drug screening and for understanding basic mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

ImportanceThe current biological systems for the study of COVID-19 are in vitro systems that differ from the human lung in many respects, and animal hosts to which the virus is not adapted. We developed another alternative for studying pathogenesis and drug susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissues. We consider the importance of this work to relate to the practical use of this culture system as a repeatable and scalable approach that allows for the study of an important infection in relevant tissues.

134,"High-throughput screening of the ReFRAME, Pandemic Box, and COVID Box drug repurposing libraries against SARS-CoV2 nsp15 endoribonuclease to identify small-molecule inhibitors of viral activity.","SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, and has taken over 1.7 million lives as of mid-December, 2020. Although great progress has been made in the development of effective countermeasures, with several pharmaceutical companies approved or poised to deliver vaccines to market, there is still an unmet need of essential antiviral drugs with therapeutic impact for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Towards this goal, a high-throughput assay was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 uracil-dependent endonuclease (endoU) function against 13 thousand compounds from drug and lead repurposing compound libraries. While over 80% of initial hit compounds were pan-assay inhibitory compounds, three hits were confirmed as nsp15 endoU inhibitors in the 1-20 M range in vitro. Furthermore, Exebryl-1, a {beta}-amyloid anti-aggregation molecule for Alzheimers therapy, was shown to have antiviral activity between 10 to 66 M, in VERO, Caco-2, and Calu-3 cells. Although the inhibitory concentrations determined for Exebryl-1 exceed those recommended for therapeutic intervention, our findings show great promise for further optimization of Exebryl-1 as an nsp15 endoU inhibitor and as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral.

Author summaryDrugs to treat COVID-19 are urgently needed. To address this, we searched libraries of drugs and drug-like molecules for inhibitors of an essential enzyme of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein (nsp)15. We found several molecules that inhibited the nsp15 enzyme function and one was shown to be active in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This demonstrates that searching for SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 inhibitors can lead inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and thus therapeutics for COVID-19.

135,"Design of Specific Primer Sets for the Detection of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 Variants using Deep Learning","As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, new SARS-CoV-2 variants with potentially dangerous features have been identified by the scientific community. Variant B.1.1.7 lineage clade GR from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) was first detected in the UK, and it appears to possess an increased transmissibility. At the same time, South African authorities reported variant B.1.351, that shares several mutations with B.1.1.7, and might also present high transmissibility. Even more recently, a variant labeled P.1 with 17 non-synonymous mutations was detected in Brazil. In such a situation, it is paramount to rapidly develop specific molecular tests to uniquely identify, contain, and study new variants. Using a completely automated pipeline built around deep learning techniques, we design primer sets specific to variant B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, respectively. Starting from sequences openly available in the GISAID repository, our pipeline was able to deliver the primer sets in just under 16 hours for each case study. In-silico tests show that the sequences in the primer sets present high accuracy and do not appear in samples from different viruses, nor in other coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-2 variants. The presented methodology can be exploited to swiftly obtain primer sets for each independent new variant, that can later be a part of a multiplexed approach for the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, since our approach delivers primers able to differentiate between variants, it can be used as a second step of a diagnosis in cases already positive to COVID-19, to identify individuals carrying variants with potentially threatening features.",Alejandro Lopez-Rincon; Carmina Perez-Romero; Alberto Tonda; Lucero Mendoza-Maldonado; Eric Claassen; Johan Garssen; Aletta D Kraneveld,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.427043,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.427043,2021-01-21,2021-01-21,,False

Because presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been reported in the human reproductive system, we assessed whether pre-implantation embryos are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 entry. RNA-seq and immunostaining studies revealed presence of two key entry factors in the trophectoderm of blastocyst-stage embryos, the ACE2 receptor and the TMPRSS2 protease. Exposure of blastocysts to fluorescent reporter virions pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein revealed S-ACE2 dependent entry and fusion.

In this article, we present a comprehensive study of the changes in scholarly publication landscape for biomedical sciences during the COVID-19 pandemic, with special emphasis on preprints posted on bioRxiv and medRxiv servers. We observe the emergence of a new category of preprint authors working in the fields of immunology, microbiology, infectious diseases, and epidemiology, who extensively used preprint platforms during the pandemic for sharing their immediate findings. The majority of these findings were works-in-progress unfitting for a prompt acceptance by refereed journals. The COVID-19 preprints that became peer-reviewed journal articles were often submitted to journals concurrently with the posting on a preprint server, and the entire publication cycle, from preprint to the online journal article, took on average 63 days. This included an expedited peer-review process of 43 days and journals production stage of 15 days, however there was a wide variation in publication delays between journals.

As a result of buying the previous items, the household spending per month will be increase during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

AimsTo calculate the average costs of each extra item involved in households spending during COVID-19 pandemic and to predict the total average extra costs spending by households.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted at High Institute of Public Health (HIPH), University Alexandria. Exponential snowball sampling was used to recruit students at HIPH and their friends. Trimming costs was done to remove extreme low and high values. A regression tree modelling was implemented to predict the total extra costs spending during COVID-19 pandemic.

ResultsMost of the respondents were female (81%) and aged between 30 and 40 (56.3%). About 63.1% of families had the same monthly income while 35.4% had a decrease in monthly income. A significant reduction in days of leaving home before and after COVID-19 pandemic was observed (before; mean= 5.86, after; mean = 4.66, P=0.000). The extra spending in grocery was the dominated item compared to other items (mean = 707.2, SD = 530.7). Regarding regression tree, the maximum average extra costs due to COVID-19 pandemic was 1386 L.E/month (around 88.23$/month) while the minimum average extra costs was 217 L.E/month (around 13.81$/month).

ConclusionsThe effect of COVID-19 pandemic in households spending varies largely between households, it depends on what they do to prevent COVID-19.

Here we study the effectiveness of seven NPIs in reducing the number of new infections, which was inferred from the reported cases of COVID-19 using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model. Based on data from the first epidemic wave of n = 20 countries (i.e., the United States, Canada, Australia, the EU-15 countries, Norway, and Switzerland), we estimate the relative reduction in the number of new infections attributed to each NPI. Among the NPIs considered, event bans were most effective, followed by venue and school closures, whereas stay-at-home orders and work bans were least effective.

If there is a gradient or a potential difference of a quantity a diffusion process happens and this ends if an equilibrium is reached only. The concentration of a species maybe such quantity, or the voltage. An electric currant will be driven by a voltage difference for example.

In this COVID-19 pandemic one observes both regions with low incidence and other ones with high incidence. The local different people density could be a reason for that. In populous areas like big cities or congested urban areas higher COVID-19 incidences could be observed than in rural regions.

The aim of this paper consists in the application of a diffusion concept to describe one possible issue of the the COVID-19 propagation.

This will be discussed for the German situation based on the quite different incidence data for the different federal states of Germany.

Main outcome measures: The survey asked: ""What is your likelihood of catching COVID-19 in the next three months?"" The physicians were asked to give their best estimate as an exact percentage. Results: The survey was completed by 1004 physicians (40 countries, 67 specialties, 49% frontline [e.g. ER, infectious disease, internal medicine]) with a mean (SD) age of 49.14 (12) years. Mean (SD) self-risk estimate was 32.3% + 26% with a range from 0% to 100% (Figure 1a). Risk estimates were higher in younger (<50 years) doctors and in non-US doctors versus their older and US counterparts (p<0.05 for all) (Figure 1b). Risk estimates were higher among front line versus non-frontline doctors (p<0.05). Risk estimates were higher for women than men (p<0.05) among respondents (60%) reporting gender. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first global study to document physician risk perceptions for catching COVID-19 and how it is impacted by age, gender, practice specialty and geography. Accurate calibration of risk perception is vital since both over- and underestimation of risk could impact physician behavior and have implications for public health.",P.

144,Electronic Computer-Based Model of Combined Ventilation Using a New Medical Device,"IntroductionThe increased demand for mechanical ventilation caused by SARS-CoV-2 could generate a critical situation where patients may lose access to mechanical ventilators. Combined ventilation, in which two patients are connected to a single ventilator has been proposed as a bridge while waiting for new ventilators availability. DuplicAR is a new device that allows individualization of ventilatory parameters in combined ventilation models.

Materials and MethodsWith an electronic circuit simulator applet, an electrical model of combined ventilation was created using resistor-capacitor circuits. The DuplicAR system electrical analog was added to the model. Through computational simulation, the model is tested in different scenarios with the aim of achieving adequate ventilation of two subjects under different circumstances: 1) two identical subjects; 2) two subjects with the same size but different lung compliance; and 3) two subjects with different size and compliance. The goal is to achieve the established load per unit of size on each capacitor under different levels of end-expiratory voltage (analog of end-expiratory pressure). Data collected included capacitor load and voltage, and load normalized to the weight of the simulated patient.

ResultsIn the three simulated stages, it is possible to provide the proper load to each capacitor under different circumstances. If the pair of connected capacitors have different capacitances, adjustments must be made to the source voltage and/or the resistance of the DuplicAR system to provide the appropriate load for each capacitor under initial conditions. In pressure control simulation, increasing the end-expiratory voltage on one capacitor requires increasing the source voltage and the resistance on the other capacitor. On the other hand, in the volume control simulation, it is only required to intervene in the resistance.

ConclusionsUnder simulated conditions, the electrical model of the DuplicAR system allows individualization of combined mechanical ventilation.",Matias Ramos Sr.; Roberto Orofino Sr.; Diego Riva Sr.; Maria Fernanda Biancolini Sr.; Ignacio Lugones Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.21249912,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.21249912,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
145,Modelling the Long-Term Effects of Covid-19 Cancer Services Disruption on Patient Outcome in Scotland,"BackgroundModelling the long-term effects of disruption of cancer services and minimising any excess cancer mortality due to the Covid-19 pandemic is of great importance. Here we adapted a stage-shift model to inform service planning decisions within NHS Scotland for the   Detect Cancer Early tumours, breast, colorectal and lung cancer which represent 46% of all cancers diagnosed in Scotland.

Methods & DataLung, colorectal and breast cancer incidence data for years 2017-18 were obtained from Public Health Scotland Cancer Quality Performance Indicators (QPI), to define a baseline scenario. The most current stage-specific 5-year survival data came from 2009-2014 national cancer registry and South East Scotland Cancer Network (SCAN) QPI audit datasets. The Degeling et al., inverse stage-shift model was adapted to estimate changes in stage at diagnosis, excess mortality and life-years lost from delays to diagnosis and treatment due to Covid-19-related health services disruption. Three and 6-month periods of disruption were simulated to demonstrate the model predictions.

ResultsApproximately, 1-9% reductions in stage I/II presentations leading up to 2-10% increases in stage III/IV presentations are estimated across the three cancer types. A 6-month period of service disruption is predicted to lead to excess deaths at 5 years of 32.5 (31.1, 33.9) per 1000 cases for lung cancer, 16.5 (7.9, 24.3) for colorectal cancer and 31.6 (28.5, 34.4) for breast cancer.

ConclusionsDisruption of cancer diagnostic services can lead to significant excess deaths in following years. Increasing diagnostic and capacity for cancer services to deal with the backlog of care are needed. Real time monitoring of incidence and referral patterns over the disruption and post-disruption period to reduce excess deaths including more rapid incidence data by stage and other key tumour/clinical characteristics at presentation for key cancer cases (on a quarterly basis). Real time monitoring in cancer care and referral patterns should help inform what type of interventions are needed to reduce excess mortality and whether different population subgroups require public health messaging campaigns. Specific mitigation measures can be the subject of additional modelling analysis to assess the benefits and inform service planning decision making.",Jonine Figueroa; Ewan Gray; Yasuko Maeda; Peter S Hall; Melanie Mackean; Kenneth Elder; Farhat Din; Malcolm G Dunlop; David Weller,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.21249993,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.21249993,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
146,Population-based seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a high-altitude setting in Peru,"BackgroundLittle evidence exists about the prevalence of COVID-19 infection at high altitude. We aimed to estimate the population-based seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Cusco at the end of the first wave.

MethodsA population-based survey was conducted in September 2020 in three settings in Cusco: (1) Cusco city at 3300 meters above the sea level (m.a.s.l.), (2) the periphery of Cusco (Santiago, San Jeronimo, San Sebastian, and Wanchaq) at 3300 m.a.s.l., and (3) Quillabamba city, located at 1050 m.a.s.l. People aged [&ge;]18 years within a family unit were included. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was based on identifying total antibodies (IgM and IgG) anti-SARS-CoV-2 in serum using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 chemiluminescence test.

FindingsWe enrolled 1924 participants from 712 families. Of the total, 637 participants were COVID-19 seropositive. Seroprevalence was 38{middle dot}8% (95%CI: 33{middle dot}4%-44{middle dot}9%) in Cusco city, 34{middle dot}9% (95%CI: 30{middle dot}4%-40{middle dot}1%) in the periphery of Cusco, and 20{middle dot}3% (95%CI: 16{middle dot}2%-25{middle dot}6%) in Quillabamba. In 141 families (19{middle dot}8%; 95%CI: 17{middle dot}0%-22{middle dot}8%) the whole members were positive to the test. Living with more than three persons in the same house, a positive COVID-19 case at home, and a member who died in the last five months were factors associated with COVID-19 positivity. The smell/taste alteration was the symptom most associated with seropositivity (aOR= 14{middle dot}27, 95% CI: 8{middle dot}24-24{middle dot}70); whereas always wearing a face shield (aOR= 0{middle dot}62; 95% CI: 0{middle dot}46-0{middle dot}84) or a facial mask (aOR= 0{middle dot}65, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}47-0{middle dot}88) reduced that probability.

InterpretationSeroprevalence of COVID-19 in Cusco was high, with significant differences between settings. Wearing masks and face shields were associated with lower rate of infection; however, efforts must be made to sustain them over time since there is still a high proportion of susceptible people.

147,Sword of Damocles or choosing well. Population genetics sheds light into the future of the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 new mutant strains.,"An immense scientific effort has been made worldwide due to Covid-19s pandemic magnitude. It has made possible to identify almost 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 different genetic variants, connecting them with clinical and epidemiological findings. Among this immense data collection, that constitutes the biggest evolutionary experiment in history, is buried the answer to what will happen in the future. Will new strains, more contagious than the current ones or resistant to the vaccines, arise by mutation? Although theoretic population genetics is, by far, the most powerful tool we have to do an accurate prediction, it has been barely used for the study of SARS-CoV-2 due to its conceptual difficulty. Having in mind that the size of the SARS-CoV-2 population is astronomical we can apply a discrete treatment, based on the branching process method, Fokker-Plank equations and Kolmogoroffs forward equations, to calculate the survival likelihood through time, to elucidate the likelihood to become dominant genotypes and how long will this take, for new SARS-CoV-2 mutants depending on their selective advantage. Results show that most of the new mutants that will arise in the SARS-CoV-2 meta-population will stay at very low frequencies. However, some few new mutants, significantly more infectious than current ones, will still emerge and become dominant in the population favoured by a great selective advantage. Far from showing a ""mutational meltdown"", SARS-CoV-2 meta-population will increase its fitness becoming more infective. There is a probability, small but finite, that new mutants arise resistant to some vaccines. High infected numbers and slow vaccination programs will significantly increase this likelihood.",Javier Garcia Garcia de Alcañiz; Victoria Lopez-Rodas; Eduardo Costas Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.21249924,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.21249924,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
148,"Estimating Effect-sizes to Infer if COVID-19 transmission rates were low because of Masks, Heat or High because of Air-conditioners, Tests","How does one interpret the observed increase or decrease in COVID-19 case rates? Did the compliance to the non-pharmaceutical interventions, seasonal changes in the temperature influence the transmission rates or are they purely an artefact of the number of tests? To answer these questions, we estimate the effect-sizes from these different factors on the reproduction ratios (Rt) from the different states of the USA during March 9 to August 9. Ideally Rt should be less than 1 to keep the pandemic under control and our model predicts many of these factors contributed significantly to the Rts: Post-lockdown opening of the restaurants and nightclubs contributed 0.04 (CI 0.04-0.04) and 0.11 (CI. 0.11-0.11) to Rt. The mask mandates helped reduce Rt by 0.28 (CI 0.28-0.29)), whereas the testing rates which may have influenced the number of infections observed, did not influence Rt beyond 10,000 daily tests 0.07 (CI -0.57-0.42). In our attempt to understand the role of temperature, the contribution to the Rt was found to increase on both sides of 55 F, which we infer as a reflection of the climatization needs. A further analysis using the cooling and heating needs showed contributions of 0.24 (CI 0.18-0.31) and 0.31 (CI 0.28-0.33) respectively. The work thus illustrates a data-driven approach for estimating the effect-sizes on the graded policies, and the possibility of prioritizing the interventions, if necessary by weighing the economic costs and ease of acceptance with them.",C.

149,Development and validation of multivariable prediction models for adverse COVID-19 outcomes in IBD patients,"Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSImportanceC_ST_ABSRisk calculators can facilitate shared medical decision-making1. Demographics, comorbidities, medication use, geographic region, and other factors may increase the risk for COVID-19-related complications among patients with IBD2,3.

ObjectivesDevelop an individualized prognostic risk prediction tool for predicting the probability of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis study developed and validated prognostic penalized logistic regression models4 using reports to Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) from March-October 2020. Model development was done using a training data set (85% of cases reported March 13 - September 15, 2020), and model validation was conducted using a test data set (the remaining 15% of cases plus all cases reported September 16-October 20, 2020).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresCOVID-19 related:

O_LIHospitalization+: composite outcome of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death
C_LIO_LIICU+: composite outcome of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death
C_LIO_LIDeath
C_LI

We assessed the resulting models discrimination using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and reported the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

ResultsWe included 2709 cases from 59 countries (mean age 41.2 years [s.d. 18], 50.2% male). A total of 633 (24%) were hospitalized, 137 (5%) were admitted to the ICU or intubated, and 69 (3%) died. 2009 patients comprised the training set and 700 the test set.

The models demonstrated excellent discrimination, with a test set AUC (95% CI) of 0.79 (0.75, 0.83) for Hospitalization+, 0.88 (0.82, 0.95) for ICU+, and 0.94 (0.89, 0.99) for Death. Age, comorbidities, corticosteroid use, and male gender were associated with higher risk of death, while use of biologic therapies was associated with a lower risk.

Conclusions and RelevancePrognostic models can effectively predict who is at higher risk for COVID-19-related adverse outcomes in a population of IBD patients. A free online risk calculator (https://covidibd.org/covid-19-risk-calculator/) is available for healthcare providers to facilitate discussion of risks due to COVID-19 with IBD patients. The tool numerically and visually summarizes the patients probabilities of adverse outcomes and associated CIs. Helping physicians identify their highest-risk patients will be important in the coming months as cases rise in the US and worldwide. This tool can also serve as a model for risk stratification in other chronic diseases.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow well can a multivariable risk model predict the risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or death due to COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?

FindingsMultivariable prediction models developed using data from an international voluntary registry of IBD patients and available for use online (https://covidibd.org/) have very good discrimination for predicting hospitalization (Test set AUC 0.79) and excellent discrimination for ICU admission (Test set AUC 0.88) and death (Test set AUC 0.94). The models were developed with a training sample of 2009 cases and validated in an independent test sample of 700 cases comprised of a random sub-sample of cases and all cases entered in the registry during a one-month period after model development.

150,Population-scale patient safety data reveal inequalities in adverse events before and during COVID-19 pandemic,"Adverse patient safety events were associated with 110 thousand deaths in the U.S. alone in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has further challenged the ability of healthcare systems to ensure medication safety, and its effects on patient safety remain unknown. Here, we investigate negative outcomes associated with medication use before and during the pandemic. Using a dataset of 10,443,476 reports involving 3,624 drugs and 19,193 adverse events, we develop an algorithmic approach to analyze the pandemics impact on incidence of drug safety events by evaluating disproportional reporting relative to the pre-pandemic time, quantifying unexpected trends in clinical outcomes, and adjusting for drug interference. Among 64 adverse events identified by our analyses, we find 54 have increased incidence rates during the pandemic, even though reporting of adverse events has decreased by 4.4% overall. We find clinically relevant differences in drug safety outcomes between demographic groups. Comparing to male patients, women report 47.0% more distinct adverse events whose occurrence significantly increased during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic levels. Out of 53 adverse events with the pre-pandemic gender gap, 33 have increased gap during the pandemic more than would have been expected had the pandemic not occurred. While musculoskeletal and metabolic side effects are disproportionately enriched in women during the pandemic, immune-related adverse events are enriched only in men. We also find the number of adverse events with a higher reporting ratio during the pandemic in adults is higher (16.8%) than in older patients (adjusted for population size). Our findings have implications for safe medication use and public health policy and highlight the role of variation in adverse events for improving patient safety during a public health emergency.",Xiang Zhang; Marissa Sumathipala; Marinka Zitnik,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.21249988,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.21249988,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
151,The Socioeconomic Impact of COVID-19 in Urban Informal Settlements,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reached almost every corner of the world. Without a pharmaceutical solution, governments have been forced to implement regulations and public policies to control social behavior and prevent the spread of the virus. There is dramatic evidence of the social and economic effects of these measures and their disparate impact on vulnerable communities. Individuals living in urban informal settlements are in a structurally disadvantaged position to cope with a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the socioeconomic impact of the crisis brought by the pandemic in informal settlements in Chile. We use a three-wave panel study to compare the situation in informal settlements before and during the health crisis. We show that households living in informal settlements are paying a high toll. Their employment loss is dramatic, substantially larger than the loss reported in the general population, and has particularly affected the inmigrant population. We also find that the pandemic has triggered neighborhood cooperation within the settlements. Targeted government assistance programs have reached these communities; however, this groups coverage is not enough to counteract the magnitude of the crisis. Our results suggest that governments, the non-profit sector, and the community need to urgently provide economic support and protections to individuals living in informal settlements and consider this opportunity for long-term improvements in these marginalized communities.

ObjectivesTo summarize the current literature on COVID-19 in transplant patients especially the data regarding the immunosuppression protocols, clinical presentation, and outcomes.

Search strategyA systematic search of MEDLINE, EBSCO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, LitCovid, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases. The references of the relevant studies were also searched. The search was last updated on June 3, 2020.

Selection CriteriaPrimary reports of solid organ transplant patients who developed COVID-19. An overlap of cases in different reports was checked.

Data collection and analysisA descriptive summary of immunosuppression therapy (before and after COVID-19), clinical presentation (symptoms, imaging, laboratory, and disease severity), management (oxygen therapy, antiviral, and antibacterial), major outcomes (Intensive care admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury), and mortality.

Main resultsWe identified 74 studies reporting 823 cases of solid organ transplantation with COVID-19. Among 372 patients, 114 (30.6%) were mild COVID-19, 101 (27.2%) moderate, and 157 (42.2%) severe or critical.

Major outcomes included intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, and acute kidney injury, which occurred in 121 (14.7%), 97 (11.8%), and 63 (7.7%) of patients, respectively. Mortality was reported in 160 (19.4%) patients. Missing individual data hindered making clinical correlations.

153,Analysis of communities of countries with similar dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution,"This work addresses the spread of the coronavirus through a non-parametric approach, with the aim of identifying communities of countries based on how similar their evolution of the disease is. The analysis focuses on the number of daily new COVID-19 cases per ten thousand people during a period covering at least 250 days after the confirmation of the tenth case. Dynamic analysis is performed by constructing Minimal Spanning Trees (MST) and identifying groups of similarity in contagions evolution in 95 time windows of a 150-day amplitude that moves one day at a time. The number of times countries belonged to a similar performance group in constructed time windows was the intensity measure considered. Groups composition is not stable, indicating that the COVID-19 evolution needs to be treated as a dynamic problem in the context of complex systems. Three communities were identified by applying the Louvain algorithm. Identified communities analysis according to each countrys socioeconomic characteristics and variables related to the disease sheds light on whether there is any suggested course of action. Even when strong testing and tracing cases policies may be related with a more stable dynamic of the disease, results indicate that communities are conformed by countries with diverse characteristics. The best option to counteract the harmful effects of a pandemic may be having strong health systems in place,with contingent capacity to deal with unforeseen events and available resources capable of a rapid expansion of its capacity.",Emiliano Alvarez; Juan Gabriel Brida; Erick Limas; Lucia Rosich,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250050,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250050,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
154,"State-of-the-Art Risk Models for Diabetes, Hypertension, Visual Diminution, and COVID-19 Severity in Mexico","BACKGROUNDDiabetes and hypertension are among top public health priorities, particularly in low and middle-income countries where their health and socioeconomic impact is exacerbated by the quality and accessibility of health care. Moreover, their connection with severe or deadly COVID-19 illness has further increased their societal relevance. Tools for early detection of these chronic diseases enable interventions to prevent high-impact complications, such as loss of sight and kidney failure. Similarly, prognostic tools for COVID-19 help stratify the population to prioritize protection and vaccination of high-risk groups, optimize medical resources and tests, and raise public awareness.

METHODSWe developed and validated state-of-the-art risk models for the presence of undiagnosed diabetes, hypertension, visual complications associated with diabetes and hypertension, and the risk of severe COVID-19 illness (if infected). The models were estimated using modern methods from the field of statistical learning (e.g., gradient boosting trees), and were trained on publicly available data containing health and socioeconomic information representative of the Mexican population. Lastly, we assembled a short integrated questionnaire and deployed a free online tool for massifying access to risk assessment.

RESULTSOur results show substantial improvements in accuracy and algorithmic equity (balance of accuracy across population subgroups), compared to established benchmarks. In particular, the models: i) reached state-of-the-art sensitivity and specificity rates of 90% and 56% (0.83 AUC) for diabetes, 80% and 64% (0.79 AUC) for hypertension, 90% and 56% (0.84 AUC) for visual diminution as a complication, and 90% and 60% (0.84 AUC) for development of severe COVID disease; and ii) achieved substantially higher equity in sensitivity across gender, indigenous/non-indigenous, and regional populations. In addition, the most relevant features used by the models were in line with risk factors commonly identified by previous studies. Finally, the online platform was deployed and made accessible to the public on a massive scale.

CONCLUSIONSThe use of large databases representative of the Mexican population, coupled with modern statistical learning methods, allowed the development of risk models with state-of-the-art accuracy and equity for two of the most relevant chronic diseases, their eye complications, and COVID-19 severity. These tools can have a meaningful impact on democratizing early detection, enabling large-scale preventive strategies in low-resource health systems, increasing public awareness, and ultimately raising social well-being.",Heladio Amaya; Jennifer Enciso; Daniela Meizner; Alex Pentland; Alejandro Noriega,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250034,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250034,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True

Public health measures to slow down the spread of the virus involve using a face mask, social-distancing, and frequent hand washing. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a global campaign on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curtail the spread of the virus. However, the number of cases, mortality, and hospitalization continue to rise globally, including in the United States. We developed a mathematical model to assess the impact of a public health education program on the coronavirus outbreak in the US.

156,Hidden Parameters impacting resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"The spread of the COVID-19 virus has had an enormous impact on the worlds health and socioeconomic system. While lockdowns, which severely limit the movement of the population, have been implemented in March 2020 and again recently, the psychological and economic cost are severe. Removal of these restrictions occurred with varying degrees of success.

To study the resurgence of the virus in some communities we consider an epidemiological model, SIR-SD-L, that incorporates introduction of new population due to the removal of lockdown and identify parameters that impact the spread of the virus. This compartmental model of the epidemic incorporates a social distance metric based on progression of the infections; it models the dynamic propensity of infection spread based on the current infections relative to the susceptible population. The model is validated using data on growth of infections, hospitalizations and death, considering 24 counties in multiple US states and a categorization of the lockdown removal policies after the first lockdown. Model parameters, which include a compartment for the isolated population, are used to determine the rate at which the susceptible population increases to fit the rate of infections. Along with social distancing mandates, we identify active infections and the susceptible population as important factors in the resurgence of infections. We measure the efficacy of the lockdown removal policy via a ratio, PIR, which evaluates to less than 1 for counties where social distancing measures were mandated and which delayed complete re-opening of closed spaces like bars and restaurants. For other counties this ratio is greater than 1.

We also studied infection growth in the 24 US counties with respect to a release policy derived from CDC guidelines and compared against strategies that delay the removal of lockdown.

Our results illustrate that guidelines for deciding when lockdown rules are to be relaxed should consider the current state of the infectious population and the remaining susceptible population, hidden parameters that are deducible from models such as SIR-SD-L, and not limit policy considerations to the rate of new infections alone. This is especially true for counties where the growth rate of the virus is initially slow and misleading.

157,Optimizing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies in France: Results from a stochastic agent-based model,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a major global societal, economic and health threat. The availability of COVID-19 vaccines has raised hopes for a decline in the pandemic. We built upon a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. We examined the potential impact of different vaccination strategies, defined according to the age, medical conditions, and expected vaccination acceptance of the target non-immunized adult population, on disease cumulative incidence, mortality, and number of hospital admissions. Specifically, we examined whether these vaccination strategies would allow to lift all non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), based on a sufficiently low cumulative mortality and number of hospital admissions. While vaccinating the full adult non-immunized population, if performed immediately, would be highly effective in reducing incidence, mortality and hospital-bed occupancy, and would allow discontinuing all NPIs, this strategy would require a large number of vaccine doses. Vaccinating only adults at higher risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e. those aged over 65 years or with medical conditions, would be insufficient to lift NPIs. Immediately vaccinating only adults aged over 45 years, or only adults aged over 55 years with mandatory vaccination of those aged over 65 years, would enable lifting all NPIs with a substantially lower number of vaccine doses, particularly with the latter vaccination strategy. Benefits of these strategies would be markedly reduced if the vaccination was delayed, was less effective than expected on virus transmission or in preventing COVID-19 among older adults, or was not widely accepted.",Nicolas Hoertel; Martin Blachier; Frederic Limosin; Marina Sanchez-Rico; Carlos Blanco; Mark Olfson; Stephane Luchini; Michael Schwarzinger; Henri Leleu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.21249970,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.17.21249970,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True

159,City Reduced Probability of Infection (CityRPI) for Indoor Airborne Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and Urban Building Energy Impacts,"Airborne transmission of aerosols produced by asymptomatic individuals is a large portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spread indoors. Outdoor air ventilation rate, air filtration, room occupancy, exposure time, and mask-wearing are among the key parameters that affect its airborne transmission in indoor spaces. In this work, we developed a new web-based platform, City Reduced Probability of Infection - CityRPI, to calculate the indoor airborne transmission of COVID-19 in various buildings of a city scale. An archetype library of twenty-nine building types is developed based on several standards and references. Among the mitigation strategies recommended to reduce infection risk, some could result in significant energy impacts on buildings. To study the combined effects of energy consumption and reduced infection probability, we integrated CityRPI with City Building Energy Model. We applied the integrated model to Montreal City and studied the impact of six mitigation measures on the infection risk and peak energy demand in winter. It shows that the same strategy could perform quite differently, depending on building types and properties. In the winter season, increasing the outdoor air ventilation rate may cause massive building energy consumption. All strategies are shown to reduce the infection risk but wearing a mask and reducing exposure time are the most effective strategies in many buildings, with around 60% reduction. Doubling the outdoor air ventilation rate is not as effective as other strategies to reduce the risk with less than 35% reduction. It also significantly increases building peak heating demand with 10-60%.",Ali Katal; Maher Albettar; Liangzhu (Leon) Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250046,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250046,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
160,"Emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 strain in Southern California, USA","Since October 2020, novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 including B.1.1.7, have been identified to be of global significance from an infection and surveillance perspective. While this strain (B.1.1.7) may play an important role in increased COVID rates in the UK, there are still no reported strains to account for the spike of cases in Los Angeles (LA) and California as a whole, which currently has some of the highest absolute and per-capita COVID transmission rates in the country. From the early days of the pandemic when LA only had a single viral genome uploaded onto GISAID we have been at the forefront of generating and analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from the LA region. We report a novel strain emerging in Southern California. Most current cases in the catchment population in LA fall into two distinct subclades: 1) 20G (24% of total) is the predominant subclade currently in the United States 2) a relatively novel strain in clade 20C, CAL.20C strain ([~]36% of total) is defined by five concurrent mutations. After an analysis of all of the publicly available data and a comparison to our recent sequences, we see a dramatic growth in the relative percentage of the CAL.20C strain beginning in November of 2020. The predominance of this strain coincides with the increased positivity rate seen in this region. Unlike 20G, this novel strain CAL.20C is defined by multiple mutations in the S protein, a characteristic it shares with both the UK and South African strains, both of which are of significant clinical and scientific interest",Wenjuan Zhang; Brian Davis; Stephanie S Chen; Jorge Sincuir Martinez; Jasmine T Plummer; Eric Vail,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249786,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249786,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
161,"Clinical utility of Corona Virus Disease-19 serum IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibodies and inflammatory markers","Most deaths from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection occur in older subjects. We assessed age effects and clinical utility of serum SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and neutralizing antibodies and serum inflammatory markers. Serum IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibody levels were measured using chemiluminescence assays from Diazyme (Poway, CA), while serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), C reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin were measured with immunoassays obtained from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). In 79,005 subjects, IgG and IgM levels were positive ([&ge;]1.0 arbitrary units [AU]/mL) in 5.29% and 3.25% of subjects, respectively. In antibody positive subjects, median IgG levels were 3.93 AU/mL if <45 years of age, 10.18 AU/mL if 45-64 years of age, and 10.85 AU/mL if [&ge;]65 years of age (p<0.0001). In SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases, family members and exposed subjects (n=1,111), antibody testing was found to be valuable for case finding, and persistent IgM levels were associated with chronic symptoms. In non-hospitalized and hospitalized subjects assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (n=278), median IgG levels in AU/mL were 0.05 in negative subjects (n=100), 14.83 in positive outpatients (n=129), and 30.61 in positive hospitalized patients (n=49, p<0.0001). Neutralizing antibody levels correlated significantly with IgG (r=0.875; p<0.0001). Two or more of the criteria of IL-6 [&ge;]10 pg/mL, CRP [&ge;]10 mg/L, and/or IgM >1.0 AU/mL occurred in 97.7% of inpatients versus 1.8% of outpatients (>50-fold relative risk, C statistic 0.986, p<0.0001). Our data indicate that: 1) IgG levels are significantly higher in positive older subjects, possibly to compensate for decreased cellular immunity with aging; 2) IgG levels are important for case finding in family clusters; 3) IgG levels are significantly correlated with neutralizing antibody levels; 4) persistently elevated IgM levels are associated with chronic disease; and 5) markedly elevated IL-6, hs-CRP, and/or positive IgM accurately identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive subjects requiring hospitalization.",Ernst J Schaefer; Florence Comite; Latha Dulipsingh; Maxine Lang; Jessica Jimison; Martin M Grajower; Nathan E Lebowitz; Andrew S Geller; Margaret R Diffenderfer; Lihong He; Gary Breton; Michael L Dansinger; Ben Saida; Chong Yuan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21249604,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21249604,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True

We analyzed short, descriptive daily reports of patient status in 7,180 hospitalized recipients of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the Mayo Clinic Expanded Access Program. We assessed, from the day following transfusion, whether the patient was categorized by his or her physician as better, worse or unchanged compared to the day before, and whether, on the reporting day, the patient received mechanical ventilation, was in the ICU, had died or had been discharged. Most patients improved following transfusion, but clinical improvement was most notable in mild to moderately ill patients. Patients classified as severely ill upon enrollment improved, but not as rapidly, while patients classified as critically ill/end-stage and patients on ventilators showed worsening of disease status even after treatment with convalescent plasma. Patients age 80 and over showed little or no clinical improvement following transfusion. Clinical status at enrollment and age appear to be the primary factors in determining the therapeutic effectiveness of COVID-19 convalescent plasma among hospitalized patients.",Tengfei Ma; Chad C.

163,NEWS2 and laboratory predictors correlated with clinical deterioration in hospitalised patients with COVID-19,"BackgroundWe aimed to determine prognostic values of NEWS2 and laboratory parameters during the first week of COVID-19.

MethodsAll adult patients who were hospitalized for a confirmed COVID-19 between the 11th of March and the 11th of May 2020 were retrospectively included. To evaluate the factors in prognosis which are admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital death, univariate logistic regression analysis was performed at admission (D0), at day-3 (D3), day-5 (D5), and day-7 (D7). Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed.

ResultsOverall, 611 patients were included. Clinical deterioration was observed in 79 (12.9%) patients during hospitalisation, 36 (5.9%) during the first three days, 54 (8.8%) during the first five days, and 62 (10.1%) during the first week of hospitalisation. Our results showed that NEWS2, procalcitonin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and albumin were the best predictors for clinical deterioration at D0, D3, D5, and D7. Procalcitonin had the highest odds ratio for clinical deterioration on all days in univariate analysis. ROC analyses showed that NEWS2 at D7, procalcitonin at D5, albumin at D7, and NLR at D5 had highest AUC values. Additionally, we detected a strong correlation between NEWS2 and laboratory parameters including neutrophil, lymphocyte, NLR, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, and urea on all days.

ConclusionThis study provides a list of several laboratory parameters correlated with NEWS2 and potential predictors for ICU admission or in-hospital death during the clinical course of COVID-19.

164,Endothelial cell-activating antibodies in COVID-19,"Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are at high risk for fibrin-based occlusion of vascular beds of all sizes. Although endothelial cell activation has regularly been described as part of the COVID-19 thrombo-inflammatory storm, the upstream mediators of this activation have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we began by pursuing the hypothesis that circulating factors such as neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) remnants, D-dimer, or C-reactive protein might predict the COVID-19 serum samples (n=118) that most robustly activated cultured endothelial cells. Indeed, we found modest correlations between serum NET remnants (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and upregulation of surface E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 on endothelial cells. However, a more robust predictor of the ability of COVID-19 serum to activate endothelial cells was the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, specifically anticardiolipin IgG and IgM and anti-phosphatidlyserine/prothrombin (anti-PS/PT) IgG and IgM. Depletion of total IgG from anticardiolipin-high and anti-PS/PT-high samples markedly restrained upregulation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. At the same time, supplementation of control serum with patient IgG was sufficient to trigger endothelial cell activation. These data are the first to reveal that patient antibodies are a driver of endothelial cell activation and add important context regarding thrombo-inflammatory effects of COVID-19 autoantibodies in severe COVID-19.",Hui Shi; Yu Zuo; Alex A.

165,Blood transcriptional biomarkers of acute viral infection for detection of pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV 2 infection,"We hypothesised that host-response biomarkers of viral infections may contribute to early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, critical to breaking chains of transmission. We identified 20 candidate blood transcriptomic signatures of viral infection by systematic review and evaluated their ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to the gold-standard of virus PCR tests, among a prospective cohort of 400 hospital staff subjected to weekly testing when fit to attend work. The transcriptional signatures had limited overlap, but were mostly co-correlated as components of type 1 interferon responses. We reconstructed each signature score in blood RNA sequencing data from 41 individuals over sequential weeks spanning a first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR, and after 6-month convalescence. A single blood transcript for IFI27 provided the highest accuracy for discriminating individuals at the time of their first positive viral PCR result from uninfected controls, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.91-0.99), sensitivity 0.84 (0.7-0.93) and specificity 0.95 (0.85-0.98) at a predefined test threshold. The test performed equally well in individuals with and without symptoms, correlated with viral load, and identified incident infections one week before the first positive viral PCR with sensitivity 0.4 (0.17-0.69) and specificity 0.95 (0.85-0.98).

166,Factors associated with deaths due to COVID-19 versus other causes: population-based cohort analysis of UK primary care data and linked national death registrations within the OpenSAFELY platform,"BackgroundMortality from COVID-19 shows a strong relationship with age and pre-existing medical conditions, as does mortality from other causes. However it is unclear how specific factors are differentially associated with COVID-19 mortality as compared to mortality from other causes.

MethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England, we carried out a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform. Primary care data from England were linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged [&ge;]18 years) in the database on 1st February 2020 and with >1 year of continuous prior registration, the cut-off date for deaths was 9th November 2020. Associations between individual-level characteristics and COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths were estimated by fitting age- and sex-adjusted logistic models for these two outcomes.

Results17,456,515 individuals were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and 134,316 from other causes. Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Older age was more strongly associated with COVID-19 death than non-COVID death (e.g. ORs 40.7 [95% CI 37.7-43.8] and 29.6 [28.9-30.3] respectively for [&ge;]80 vs 50-59 years), as was male sex, deprivation, obesity, and some comorbidities. Smoking, history of cancer and chronic liver disease had stronger associations with non-COVID than COVID-19 death. All non-white ethnic groups had higher odds than white of COVID-19 death (OR for Black: 2.20 [1.96-2.47], South Asian: 2.33 [2.16-2.52]), but lower odds than white of non-COVID death (Black: 0.88 [0.83-0.94], South Asian: 0.78 [0.75-0.81]).

InterpretationSimilar associations of most individual-level factors with COVID-19 and non-COVID death suggest that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risks faced by patients, with some notable exceptions. Identifying the unique factors contributing to the excess COVID-19 mortality risk among non-white groups is a priority to inform efforts to reduce deaths from COVID-19.

167,Viral dispersion in open air,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has revived the debate about the routes of virus transmission and their likelihoods. It is of utmost importance to assess the risks of contamination of susceptible people by infectious individuals and to evaluate the level of viral transmission in the community. Most countries have imposed non-pharmaceutical measures to contain SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including social distancing and mask wearing. Here we evaluated the spreading of viruses in open air using harmless Escherichia coli bacteriophages as a surrogate. Phages were sprayed towards Petri dishes seeded with bacteria at different lengths and angles. Median droplets size was 127 {micro}m, similar to those produced by sneeze. Our results showed that the transmission rate decreased exponentially with distance. The highest recorded transmission rate was 9 x 10-6 PFU/plate when phages were sprayed from a 1 m distance, suggesting that the probability of transmission of a single virus at a 1 m distance is 1:100,000.

However, the test reagents and assay platforms are varied and may not be sufficiently robust to diagnose COVID-19.

MethodsWe reviewed 85 studies (21,530 patients), published from five regions of the world, to highlight issues involved in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic, following the standards outlined in the PRISMA statement. All relevant articles, published up to May 31, 2020, in PubMed, BioRiXv, MedRiXv, and Google Scholar, were included. We evaluated the qualitative (9749 patients) and quantitative (10,355 patients) performance of RT-PCR and serologic diagnostic tests for real-world samples, and assessed the concordance (5,538 patients) between methods in meta-analyses.

ResultsThe RT-PCR tests exhibited heterogeneity in the primers and reagents used. Of 1,957 positive RT-PCR COVID-19 participants, 1,585 had positive serum antibody (IgM +/- IgG) tests (sensitivity 0.81, 95%CI 0.66-.90). While 3,509 of 3581 participants RT-PCR negative for COVID-19 were found negative by serology testing (specificity 0.98, 95%CI 0.94-0.99). The chemiluminescent immunoassay exhibited the highest sensitivity, followed by ELISA and lateral flow immunoassays. Serology tests had higher sensitivity and specificity for laboratory-approval than for real-world reporting data.

ConclusionsThe robustness of the assays/platforms is influenced by variability in sampling and reagents. Serological testing complements and may minimize false negative RT-PCR results.

169,Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva using a guanidium based transport medium suitable for RT-PCR diagnostic assays,"BackgroundUpper respiratory samples used to test for SARS-CoV-2 virus may be infectious and present a hazard during transport and testing. A buffer with the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for COVID-19 to non-conventional settings.

MethodsWe evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-based buffer, eNAT (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28{degrees}C), refrigerated conditions (4{degrees}C) and at 35{degrees}C.

ResultsSARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at >5.6 log10 PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no cytopathic effect (CPE) on vero-E6 cell lines was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2 (saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min incubation in eNAT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus spiked at 5X the limit of detection remained positive up to 7 days of incubation in all tested conditions.

ObjectiveTo determine which county-level features best predict COVID-19 morbidity and mortality for a given county in the U.S.

DesignA Machine-Learning model that predicts COVID-19 mortality and morbidity using county-level features, followed by a SHAP-values-based importance analysis of the predictive features.

SettingPublicly available data from various American government and news websites.

Participants3,071 U.S. counties, from which 53 county-level features, as well as morbidity and mortality numbers, were collected.

MeasurementsFor each county: Ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, educational attainment, mask usage, population density, age distribution, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, air quality indicators, presidential election results, ICU beds.

ResultsA Random Forest classifier produced an AUROC of 0.863 for morbidity prediction and an AUROC of 0.812 for mortality prediction. A SHAP-values-based analysis indicated that poverty rate, obesity rate, mean commute time to work, and proportion of people that wear masks significantly affected morbidity rates, while ethnicity, median income, poverty rate, and education levels, heavily influenced mortality rates. The correlation between several of these factors and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, from 4/2020 to 11/2020 shifted, probably due to COVID-19 being initially associated with more urbanized areas, then with less urbanized ones.

LimitationsData are still coming in.

ConclusionsEthnicity, education, and economic disparity measures are major factors in predicting the COVID-19 mortality rate in a county. Between-counties low-variance factors (e.g., age), are not meaningful predictors.

Differing correlations can be explained by the COVID-19 spread from metropolitan to less metropolitan areas.

We examine the forecastability of daily COVID-19 cases in the Italian region of Lombardy using Dynamic Model Averaging and Dynamic Model Selection methods. To investigate the predictive accuracy of this approach, we compute forecast performance metrics of sequential out-of-sample real-time forecasts in a back-testing exercise ranging from March 1 to December 10 of 2020.

172,Modelling the COVID-19 Fatality Rate in England and its Regions,"A model to account for the fatality rate in England and its regions is proposed. It follows the clear observation that, rather than two connected waves, there have been many waves of infections and fatalities in the regions of England of various magnitudes, usually overlapping. The waves are self-limiting, in that clear peaks are seen, particularly in reported positive test rates. The present model considers fatalities as the data reported are more reliable than positive test rates, particularly so during the first wave when so little testing was done.

The model considers the observed waves are essentially similar in form and can be modelled using a single wave form whose final state is only dependent on its peak height and the start date of the particular wave. The basic wave form was modelled using the observed fatality rates for London, which unlike the other regions, exhibited almost completely as a single wave in the ""first wave"". Its form matches rather well with the ""Do Nothing"" model reported by Imperial College on 16th March 2020, but reduced substantially from its expected peak.

There are, essentially, only two adjustable parameters used in the model, the start date of the relevant wave and its height. The modelled fatalities for each wave are summated per day and a cumulative curve is matched to that reported. The minimal number of adjustable parameters, alongside the fact that the waves invariably overlap, provides highly stringent conditions on the fitting process.

Results are presented for each region for both the ""first"" and ""second waves. High levels of accuracy are obtained with R2 values approaching 100% against the ideal fit for both waves. It can also be seen there are fundamental differences between the underlying behaviour of the ""first"" and ""second"" waves.",Nigel Saunders,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21249816,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21249816,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
173,Studying the course of Covid-19 by a recursive delay approach,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIn an earlier paper we proposed a recursive model for epidemics; in the present paper we generalize this model to include the asymptomatic or unrecorded symptomatic people, which we call dark people (dark sector). We call this the SEPARd-model. A delay differential equation version of the model is added; it allows a better comparison to other models. We carry this out by a comparison with the classical SIR model and indicate why we believe that the SEPARd model may work better for Covid-19 than other approaches.

In the second part of the paper we explain how to deal with the data provided by the JHU, in particular we explain how to derive central model parameters from the data. Other parameters, like the size of the dark sector, are less accessible and have to be estimated more roughly, at best by results of representative serological studies which are accessible, however, only for a few countries. We start our country studies with Switzerland where such data are available. Then we apply the model to a collection of other countries, three European ones (Germany, France, Sweden), the three most stricken countries from three other continents (USA, Brazil, India). Finally we show that even the aggregated world data can be well represented by our approach.

At the end of the paper we discuss the use of the model. Perhaps the most striking application is that it allows a quantitative analysis of the influence of the time until people are sent to quarantine or hospital. This suggests that imposing means to shorten this time is a powerful tool to flatten the curves.",Erhard Scholz; Matthias Kreck,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250012,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250012,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
174,The Association between Early Country-level Testing Capacity and Later COVID-19 Mortality Outcomes,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has overrun hospital systems while exacerbating economic hardship and food insecurity on a global scale. In an effort to understand how early action to find and control the virus is associated with cumulative outcomes, we explored how country-level testing capacity affects later COVID-19 mortality.

MethodsWe used the Our World in Data database to explore testing and mortality records in 27 countries from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020; we applied ordinary-least squares regression with clustering on country to determine the association between early COVID-19 testing capacity (cumulative tests per case) and later COVID-19 mortality (time to specified mortality thresholds), adjusting for country-level confounders, including median age, GDP, hospital bed capacity, population density, and non-pharmaceutical interventions.

ResultsHigher early testing implementation, as indicated by more cumulative tests per case when mortality was still low, was associated with longer accrual time for higher per capita deaths. For instance, a higher cumulative number of tests administered per case at the time of 6 deaths per million persons was positively predictive of a longer time to reach 15 deaths per million, after adjustment for all confounders ({beta}=0.659; P=0.001).

ConclusionsCountries that developed stronger COVID-19 testing capacity at early timepoints, as measured by tests administered per case identified, experienced a slower increase of deaths per capita. Thus, this study operationalizes the value of testing and provides empirical evidence that stronger testing capacity at early timepoints is associated with reduced mortality and better pandemic control.",Sneha Kannoth; Sasikiran Kandula; Jeffrey Shaman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249998,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249998,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True

Mathematical models are used to predict the biological and epidemiological trends of an epidemic and develop methods for controlling it. In this work, we use mathematical model perspective to study the role of behavior change in slowing the spread of the COVID-19 disease in Saudi Arabia. The real-time updated data from 1st May 2020 to 8th January 2021 is collected from Saudi Ministry of Health, aiming to provide dynamic behaviors of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. During this period, it has infected 297,205 people, resulting in 6124 deaths with the mortality rate 2.06 %. There is weak positive relationship between the spread of the infection and mortality (R2 =0.412). We use Susceptible-Exposed-Infection-Recovered (SEIR) mode, the logistic growth model and with special focus on the exposed, infection and recovery individuals to simulate the final phase of the outbreak.

177,"Remote care for mental health: qualitative study with service users, carers and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic","ObjectivesTo explore the experiences of service users, carers and staff seeking or providing secondary mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DesignQualitative interview study, co-designed with mental health service users and carers.

MethodsWe conducted semi-structured, telephone or online interviews with a purposively constructed sample; a peer researcher with lived experience conducted and analysed interviews with service users. Analysis was based on the constant comparison method.

SettingNHS secondary mental health services in England between June and August 2020.

ParticipantsOf 65 participants, 20 had either accessed or needed to access English secondary mental healthcare during the pandemic; 10 were carers of people with mental health difficulties; 35 were members of staff working in NHS secondary mental health services during the pandemic.

ResultsExperiences of remote care were mixed. Some service users valued the convenience of remote methods in the context of maintaining contact with familiar clinicians. Most participants commented that a lack of non-verbal cues and the loss of a therapeutic  safe space challenged therapeutic relationship building, assessments, and identification of deteriorating mental wellbeing. Some carers felt excluded from remote meetings and concerned that assessments were incomplete without their input. Like service users, remote methods posed challenges for clinicians who reported uncertainty about technical options and a lack of training. All groups expressed concern about intersectionality exacerbating inequalities and the exclusion of some service user groups if alternatives to remote care are lost.

ConclusionsWhilst remote mental healthcare is likely to become increasingly widespread in secondary mental health services, our findings highlight the continued importance of a tailored, personal approach to decisions about remote mental healthcare. Further research should focus on which types of consultations best suit face-to-face interaction, and for whom and why, and which can be provided remotely and by which medium.

178,Sleeping under the waves: a longitudinal study across the contagion peaks of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,"After the March-April 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, a second contagion wave afflicted Europe in autumn. This study aimed to evaluate sleep health/patterns of Italians during this further challenging situation.

A total of 2013 Italians longitudinally participated in a web-based survey during the two contagion peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the risk factors for sleep disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological well-being between the two assessments (March-April and November-December 2020). Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being at high-risk for COVID-19 infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave. Advanced age, living with high-risk subjects for COVID-19 infection, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior two weeks were risk categories for poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior two weeks, being pessimistic on the vaccine, and working in healthcare were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms and anxiety. Nevertheless, we showed reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction and sleep medication use, and advanced sleep phase, confirming the alarming prevalence of poor sleepers ([~]60%) and severe depression ([~]20%) in a context of increased perceived stress.

This study demonstrated a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and mental health.

179,Examining the effect of information channel on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance,"Hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine remains high among the US population. Now that the vaccine is available to priority populations, it is critical to convince those that are hesitant to take the vaccine. Public health communication about the vaccine as well as misinformation on the vaccine occurs through a variety of different information channels. Some channels of information are more commonly found to spread misinformation. Given the expansive information environment, we sought to characterize the use of different media channels for COVID-19 vaccine information and determine the relationship between information channel and vaccine acceptance. We conducted a convenience sample of vaccine priority groups (N=2,650) between December 13 and 23, 2020 and conducted bivariate chi-squared tests and multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses to determine the relative impact of channels of information on vaccine acceptance. We found traditional channels of information, especially National TV, National newspapers, and local newspapers increased the relative risk of vaccine acceptance. Individuals who received information from traditional media compared to social media or both traditional and social media were most likely to accept the vaccine. The implications of this study suggest social media channels have a role to play in educating the hesitant to accept the vaccine, while traditional media channels should continue to promote data-driven and informed vaccine content to their viewers.",Rachael Piltch-Loeb; Elena Savoia; Beth Goldberg; Brian Hughes; Tanner Verhey; Juliette Kayyem; Cynthia Miller-Idriss; Marcia Testa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250049,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21250049,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
180,Improved screening of COVID-19 cases through a Bayesian network symptoms model and psychophysical olfactory test,"The infectiousness and presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 hinder pandemic control efforts worldwide. Therefore, the frequency of testing, accessibility, and immediate results are critical for reopening societies until an effective vaccine becomes available for a substantial proportion of the population. The loss of sense of smell is among the earliest, most discriminant, and prevalent symptoms of COVID-19, with 75-98% prevalence when clinical olfactory tests are used. Frequent screening for olfactory dysfunction could substantially reduce viral spread. However, olfactory dysfunction is generally self-reported and not measured, which is specially problematic as partial olfactory impairment is broadly unrecognized. To address this limitation, we developed a rapid psychophysical olfactory test (KOR) deployed on a web platform for automated reporting and traceability based on a low-cost, six-odor olfactory identification kit. Based on test results, we defined an anosmia score -a classifier for olfactory impairment-, and a Bayesian Network (BN) model that incorporates other symptoms for detecting COVID-19 cases. We trained and validated the BN model on two samples: suspected COVID-19 cases in five healthcare centers (n = 926; 32% COVID-19 prevalence) and healthy (asymptomatic) mining workers (n = 1, 365; 1.1% COVID-19 prevalence). All participants had COVID-19 assessment by RT-PCR assay. Using the BN model, we predicted COVID-19 status with 76% accuracy (AUC=0.79 [0.75 - 0.82]) in the healthcare sample and 84% accuracy (AUC=0.71 [0.63 - 0.79]) among miners. The KOR test and BN model enabled the detection of COVID-19 cases that otherwise appeared asymptomatic. Our results confirmed that olfactory dysfunction is the most discriminant symptom to predict COVID-19 status when based on olfactory function measurements. Overall, this work highlights the potential for low-cost, frequent, accessible, routine testing for COVID-19 surveillance to aid societys reopening.",Susana Eyheramendy Prof.; Pedro Andres Saa Prof.; Eduardo A Undurraga Prof.; Carlos Valencia Mr.; Carolina Lopez Mrs.; Luis Mendez Dr.; Javier Pizarro-Berdichevsky Dr.; Andres Finkelstein-Kulka Dr.; Sandra Solari Dr.; Nicolas Salas Mr.; Pedro Bahamondes Mr.; Martin Ugarte Dr.; Pablo Barcelo Prof.; Marcelo Arenas Prof.; Eduardo Agosin Prof.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249821,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249821,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
181,The COVID-19 Infodemic: The complex task of elevating signal and eliminating noise.,"In Situation Report #3 and 39 days before declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, the WHO declared a -19 infodemic. The volume of coronavirus tweets was far too great for one to find accurate or reliable information. Healthcare workers were flooded with which drowned the of valuable COVID-19 information. To combat the infodemic, physicians created healthcare-specific micro-communities to share scientific information with other providers. We analyzed the content of eight physician-created communities and categorized each message in one of five domains. We coded 1) an application programming interface to download tweets and their metadata in JavaScript Object Notation and 2) a reading algorithm using visual basic application in Excel to categorize the content. We superimposed the publication date of each tweet into a timeline of key pandemic events. Finally, we created NephTwitterArchive.com to help healthcare workers find COVID-19-related signal tweets when treating patients. We collected 21071 tweets from the eight hashtags studied. Only 9051 tweets were considered signal: tweets categorized into both a domain and subdomain. There was a trend towards fewer signal tweets as the pandemic progressed, with a daily median of 22% (IQR 0-42%. The most popular subdomain in Prevention was PPE (2448 signal tweets). In Therapeutics, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine wwo Azithromycin and Mechanical Ventilation were the most popular subdomains. During the active Infodemic phase (Days 0 to 49), a total of 2021 searches were completed in NephTwitterArchive.com, which was a 26% increase from the same time period before the pandemic was declared (Days -50 to -1). The COVID-19 Infodemic indicates that future endeavors must be undertaken to eliminate noise and elevate signal in all aspects of scientific discourse on Twitter. In the absence of any algorithm-based strategy, healthcare providers will be left with the nearly impossible task of manually finding high-quality tweets from amongst a tidal wave of noise.",TEJAS DESAI; Arvind Conjeevaram,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21249936,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21249936,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True

183,Covid-19 respiratory protection: the filtration efficiency assessment of decontaminated FFP2 masks responding to associated shortages,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare workers were extremely vulnerable to infection with the virus and needed continuous protection. One of the most effective and widely used means of protection was the FFP2 respirator. Unfortunately, this crisis created a shortage of these masks, prompting hospitals to explore opportunities to reuse them after decontamination.

An approach for assessing the filtration efficiency of decontaminated FFP2 masks has been proposed and applied to evaluate the possibilities of their safe reuse. The decontamination processes adopted are those based on moist heat or hydrogen peroxide. The approach introduces efficiency measures that define the filtration and protection capacity of the masks, which characterize both chemical and structural changes, and encompasses many techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The test protocol was applied to mask samples that had endured different decontamination cycles and the results of their efficiency measures were compared to brand-new masks performances.

The main result was that chemical and structural characterization of the decontaminated masks have shown no substantial change or deformation of their filter media structures. Indeed, the respiratory resistance test has shown that the results of both the FFP2 masks that have undergone a hydrogen peroxide disinfection cycle or a steam autoclave cycle remained constant with a small variation of 10 Pa from the EN149 standard. The chemical characterization, on the other hand, has shown that the filter media of the decontaminated masks remains unchanged, with no detectable chemical derivatives in its constituents.",benboubker moussa; Bouchra Omokhtar; Fouzia hmami; Khalil El mabrouk; Leena El alami; Btissam Arhoune; Mohammed Faouzi Belahcen; Ahmed Aboutajeddine,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249976,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249976,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True

DesignRetrospective observational study of adult patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st March - 1st July 2020 with a recorded hospital admission within the subsequent 31 days. Outcomes were collected up to 20th November using a standardised online data collection tool.

SettingService evaluation performed across 18 secondary or tertiary care hospitals.

Participants4112 admissions with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result between 1st March to 1st July 2020 were screened. Anonymised data from 2518 participants were returned, representing over 60% of adults hospitalised across the nation of Wales.

Main outcome measuresThe prevalence and outcomes (death, discharge) for nosocomial covid-19, assessed across of a range of possible case definitions.

ResultsInpatient mortality rates for nosocomial covid-19 ranged from 38% to 42% and remained consistently higher than participants with community-acquired infection (31% to 35%) across a range of case definitions. Participants with nosocomial-acquired infection were an older, frailer, and multi-morbid population than those with community-acquired infection. Based on the Public Health Wales case definition, 50% of participants had been admitted for 30 days prior to diagnostic testing.

ConclusionsThis represents the largest assessment of clinical outcomes for patients with nosocomial covid-19 in the UK to date. These findings suggest that inpatient mortality rates from nosocomial-infection are likely higher than previously reported, emphasizing the importance of infection control measures, and supports prioritisation of vaccination for covid-19 negative admissions and trials of post-exposure prophylaxis in inpatient cohorts.

Trial registrationThis project was approved and sponsored by the Welsh Government, as part of a national audit and quality improvement scheme for patients hospitalised covid-19 across Wales.

Key MessagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science up until 31-December-2020 for studies reporting on patient outcomes following hospital-acquired infection due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We identified a range of case-definitions for hospital-acquired infection, based on timing of diagnostic testing 5 to 15 days following admission. The largest and only multi-centre study concluded individuals with nosocomial infection are at a lower risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 than those infected in the community, however, was performed early in the pandemic and utilised a conservative definition of nosocomial infection.

What this study addsOur multi-centre observational study represents the largest assessment of clinical outcomes for patients with nosocomial covid-19 in the UK to date, and suggests the burden of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection has been underestimated. Nosocomial-infection occurred in older, frailer, and multi-morbid individuals, and was consistently associated with greater inpatient mortality than amongst those who were infected in the community across a spectrum of case-definitions. Our findings support implementation of enhanced infection control measures to reduce this burden during future waves, especially given the recent emergence of novel viral variants with enhanced transmissibility. Furthermore, roughly half of the patients meeting the Public Health Wales definition of definite nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection had been admitted for 30 days prior to diagnosis, highlighting a potential window of opportunity for inpatient pre-exposure and/or post-exposure prophylaxis.",Mark J Ponsford; Rhys Jefferies; Chris Davies; Daniel Farewell; Ian R Humphreys; Stephen Jolles; Sara Fairbairn; Keir Lewis; Daniel Menzies; Amit Benjamin; Favas Thaivalappil; Simon M Barry,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249433,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.21249433,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
185,Impact of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Spike variant on neutralisation potency of sera from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2,"SARS-CoV-2 transmission is uncontrolled in many parts of the world, compounded in some areas by higher transmission potential of the B1.1.7 variant now seen in 50 countries. In addition, many countries are extending the interval between doses of vaccine is being extended in order to expand vaccine coverage. It is unclear whether real world neutralising antibody titres will follow those in clinical trials, particularly in elderly persons, and how this will be impacted by mutations in strains such as B1.1.7. Here we tested immune responses in patients 3 weeks following the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2. We also tested neutralising antibody responses against pseudoviruses expressing wild type Spike proteins or expressing 3 key mutations present in B.1.1.7 (deletion 69/70, N501Y, A570D). IgG Spike antibody titres correlated well with neutralisation. We observed a range of neutralisation titres against wild type, with geometric mean titre (GMT) of 24. The vaccine sera exhibited a range of inhibitory dilutions giving 50% neutralisation (ID50) from <1:4 to 3449. However a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved threshold neutralisation titre of >1:4 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 years old (8/15 versus 8/8 P=0.052) after the first dose. Neutralisation titres were not significantly impacted by the combination of three Spike mutations tested, but were reduced against the full set of Spike mutations present in the B.1.1.7 variant. The highest fold change was approxiamately 6 and the median fold change for the B.1.1.7 variant versus wild type was 3.85 (IQR 2.68-5.28).

186,"Safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine formulations in healthy adults: a randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study","BackgroundEffective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed. CoV2 preS dTM is a stabilised pre-fusion S protein vaccine produced in a baculovirus expression system. We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations.

MethodsThis Phase I/II, randomised, double-blind study (NCT04537208) is being conducted in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18-49 and [&ge;]50 years) and randomised to receive one (on Day[D]1) or two doses (D1, D22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing: low-dose (LD, effective dose 1.3 {micro}g) or high-dose (HD, 2.6 {micro}g) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline); or unadjuvanted HD (18-49 years only). Safety was assessed up to D43. SARS-CoV-2 neutralising and binding antibody profiles were assessed in D1, D22 and D36 serum samples.

FindingsThe interim safety analyses included 439/441 randomised participants. There were no related unsolicited immediate AEs, serious AEs, medically attended AEs classified as severe, or AE of special interest. More grade 3 solicited reactions were reported than expected after the second dose in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. Neutralising and binding antibody responses after two vaccine doses were higher in adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted groups, in AS03-versus AF03-adjuvanted groups, in HD versus LD groups, and in younger versus older age strata.

InterpretationThe lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age stratum, and the higher than anticipated reactogenicity post dose 2 were likely due to a higher than anticipated host cell protein content and lower than planned antigen dose in the clinical material. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the optimal antigen formulation and dose.",Paul A Goepfert; Bo Fu; Anne-Laure Chabanon; Matthew I Bonaparte; Matthew G Davis; Brandon J Essink; Ian Frank; Owen Haney; Helene Janosczyk; Michael C Keefer; Marguerite Koutsoukos; Murray A Kimmel; Roger Masotti; Stephen J Savarino; Lode Schuerman; Howard Schwartz; Lawrence D Sher; Jon Smith; Fernanda Tavares-Da-Silva; Sanjay Gurunathan; Carlos A DiazGranados; Guy DeBruyn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.20248611,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.20248611,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
187,"A comprehensive antigen production and characterization study for easy-to-implement, highly specific and quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays","Antibody tests are essential tools to investigate humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. While first-generation antibody tests have primarily provided qualitative results with low specificity, accurate seroprevalence studies and tracking of antibody levels over time require highly specific, sensitive and quantitative test setups. Here, we describe two quantitative ELISA antibody tests based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and the nucleocapsid protein. Comparative expression in bacterial, insect, mammalian and plant-based platforms enabled the identification of new antigen designs with superior quality and high suitability as diagnostic reagents. Both tests scored excellently in clinical validations with multi-centric specificity and sensitivity cohorts and showed unprecedented correlation with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers. Orthogonal testing increased assay specificity to 99.8%, thereby enabling robust serodiagnosis in low-prevalence settings. The inclusion of a calibrator permits accurate quantitative monitoring of antibody concentrations in samples collected at different time points during the acute and convalescent phase of COVID-19.",Miriam Klausberger; Mark Duerkop; Helmuth Haslacher; Gordana Wozniak-Knopp; Monika Cserjan-Puschmann; Thomas Perkmann; Nico Lingg; Patricia Pereira Aguilar; Elisabeth Laurent; Jelle De Vos; Manuela Hofer; Barbara Holzer; Maria Stadler; Gabriele Manhart; Klemens Vierlinger; Margot Egger; Lisa Milchram; Elisabeth Gludovacz; Nicolas Marx; Christoph Koeppl; Christopher Tauer; Juergen Beck; Daniel Maresch; Clemens Gruenwald-Gruber; Florian Strobl; Peter Satzer; Gerhard Stadlmayr; Ulrike Vavra; Jasmin Huber; Markus Wahrmann; Farsad Eskandary; Marie-Kathrin Breyer; Daniela Sieghart; Peter Quehenberger; Gerda Leitner; Robert Strassl; Alexander E Egger; Christian Irsara; Andrea Griesmacher; Gregor Hoermann; Guenter Weiss; Rosa Bellmann-Weiler; Judith Loeffler-Ragg; Nicole Borth; Richard Strasser; Alois Jungbauer; Rainer Hahn; Juergen Mairhofer; Boris Hartmann; Nikolaus B Binder; Gerald Striedner; Lukas Mach; Andreas Weinhaeusl; Benjamin Dieplinger; Florian Grebien; Wilhelm Gerner; Christoph J Binder; Reingard Grabherr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21249921,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21249921,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
188,Diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection using specimens other than naso- and oropharyngeal swabs: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundThe rapid and accurate testing of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still crucial to mitigate, and eventually halt, the spread of this disease. Currently, nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and oropharyngeal swab (OPS) are the recommended standard sampling, yet, with some limitations. Several specimens that are easier to collect are being tested as alternatives to nasal/throat swabs in nucleic acid assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This study aims to critically appraise and compare the clinical performance of RT-PCR tests using oral saliva, deep-throat saliva/ posterior oropharyngeal saliva (DTS/POS), sputum, urine, feces, and tears/conjunctival swab [CS]) against standard specimens (NPS, OPS, or a combination of both).

MethodsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrial.gov and NIPH Clinical Trial) were searched up to the 30th of December 2020. Case-control and cohort studies on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were included. Methodological quality was assessed through the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS 2).

FindingsWe identified 3022 entries, 33 of which (1.1%) met all required criteria and were included for the quantitative data analysis. Saliva presented the higher accuracy, 92.1% (95% CI: 70.0-98.3), with an estimated sensitivity of 83.9% (95% CI: 77.4-88.8) and specificity of 96.4% (95% CI: 89.5-98.8). DTS/POS samples had an overall accuracy of 79.7% (95% CI: 43.3-95.3), with an estimated sensitivity of 90.1% (95% CI: 83.3-96.9) and specificity of 63.1% (95% CI: 36.8-89.3). Remaining index specimens presented uncertainty given the lack of studies available.

InterpretationOur meta-analysis shows that saliva samples from oral region provide a high sensitivity and specificity, being the best candidate as an alternative specimen to NPS/OPS for COVID-19 detection, with suitable protocols for swab-free sample collection to be determined and validated in the future. The distinction between oral and extra-oral salivary samples will be crucial since DTS/POS samples may induce a higher rate of false positives. Urine, feces, tears/CS and sputum seem unreliable for diagnosis. Saliva testing may increase testing capacity, ultimately promoting the implementation of truly deployable COVID-19 tests, which could either work at the point-of-care (e.g. hospitals, clinics) or outbreak control spots (e.g. schools, airports, and nursing homes).

FundingNothing to declare.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe lack of systematized data on the accuracy performance of alternative specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (against the standard NPS/OPS). The ever-growing number of studies available, made this updated systematic review timely and of the utmost importance

Added value of this studyOur meta-analysis shows that saliva samples from the oral region provide a high sensitivity and specificity, being the best candidate as an alternative specimen to NPS/OPS for COVID-19 detection, with suitable protocols for swab-free sample collection to be determined and validated in the future. The distinction between oral and extra-oral salivary samples will be crucial since DTS/POS samples may induce a higher rate of false positives.

Implications of all the available evidenceSaliva samples simply taken from the oral cavity are promising alternatives to the currently used nasal/throat swabs. Saliva specimens can be self-collected, mitigate the discomfort caused by sampling, reduce the transmission risk and increase testing capacity. Therefore, the validation of this alternative specimen will promote the implementation of truly deployable rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection at the point-of-care or outbreak spots.",Vania M.

189,"Immunisation, asymptomatic infection, herd immunity and the new variants of COVID-19","ObjectivesIs ""herd immunity"" to COVID-19 a realistic outcome of any immunisation programme with the two main vaccines currently licenced in the UK (Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2 and Astra Zeneca/Oxford vaccine ChAdOx1-S)? More formally, can these vaccines achieve a sufficient level of population immunity to reduce R, the reproduction number of the infection, to below one in the absence of any non-pharmaceutical interventions?

DesignThe study uses simple mathematical models of the transmission of COVID-19 infection from primary to secondary cases parameterised using data on virus transmission and vaccine efficacy from the literature and the regulatory approval process for the vaccines.

ResultsIn the regulatory approval documents, the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine is estimated at 0.948 (that for the Moderna vaccine is similar). Efficacy for the Oxford vaccine against primary symptomatic illness is estimated as 0.704, based on pooling of data from two dose regimes. For values of R0 similar to those reported during the first months of the pandemic, the simplest analysis implies that reducing the value of R below 1 would require 69% and 93% of the population to be vaccinated with the Pfizer and Oxford vaccine respectively (or achieve a comparable level of immunity through natural infection). However, the new variant of COVID-19 (Lineage B.1.1.7, named Variant of Concern VOC-202012/01) is reported to have an R-value 1.56 (0.92 to 2.28) times higher than the original strain. Vaccinating the entire population with the Oxford vaccine would only reduce the R value to 1.325 while the Pfizer vaccine would require 82% of the population to be vaccinated to control the spread of the new variant.

The Oxford vaccine reduces the incidence of serious illness to a greater extent than it reduces symptomatic illness. But its efficacy against the incidence of asymptomatic infections is lower, reducing its efficacy against all infection from 0.704 to 0.525 for the pooled data. Although asymptomatics are less infectious, including them in our calculations still raises R values by 20% or more, from 1.33 to 1.6 for the new variant with 100% vaccination. Neither vaccine is licenced for use in children, and when this is taken into account, this R value rises by a further 37% to 2.2 if the whole adult population is vaccinated. Even the more effective mRNA vaccines may allow the pandemic to persist via transmission amongst children, as current authorisations only allow their use on adults. In the absence of vaccination, R will reduce to 1 when 89% of the population has acquired immunity as a result of previous infection with COVID-19.

ConclusionsAll currently licensed vaccines provide substantial protection against serious illness to vaccinated individuals themselves. But the Oxford vaccine appears to have relatively low efficacy against asymptomatic infections. Although no comparable data from human trials are available for the mRNA vaccines, non-human primate studies suggest they are better at preventing nasal shedding and so transmission. Herd immunity to COVID-19 will be very difficult to achieve, especially so for the less effective vaccine. The possibility of transmission from vaccinated but infected individuals to vulnerable unvaccinated individuals is of serious concern. There is a strong case for preferring the more effective mRNA vaccines for health and social care workers and those who have contact with large numbers of vulnerable others.",Alastair Grant; Paul R Hunter,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.21249946,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.21249946,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
190,"Seroepidemiological Study of Novel Corona Virus (CoVID-19) in Tehran, Iran","A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread to all countries of the world, including Iran. Although new anti-coronavirus antibodies in patients may be identified by immunological methods with sufficient sensitivity and specificity, the conclusive diagnosis of the disease is by the molecular RT-PCR process. We used a population-based seroepidemiological survey to quantify the proportion of the exposed population with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and evaluated whether the antibodies are a marker of total or partial immunity to the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to the virus. This cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of CoVID-19 in Tehran, the capital of Iran, between April and end of October 2020. Specimens of clotted and heparinized blood (2ml) were collected from the patients. The serum and plasma were separated and stored at - 80LJ{degrees}C until use. We examined serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies from 1375 in-patients admitted to our hospitals using ELISA kits. In total, 1375 participants were enrolled in this study, and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using IgM-IgG antibody assay in 291 patients. Among the seropositive patients studied, 187 were men (64.3%), and 104 were women (35.7%) (P<0.05). The mean age of the patients was 49{+/-}8.4 years; the majority (27%) were in age group 31-40 years. Also, the lowest frequency of cases was reported in the age group of 1-10 years (P <0.05). We determined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 for IgM or IgG antibodies to be 21.2%. Diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease among SARS-CoV-2 patients [P=0.05; Odd Ratio=1.61(0.90-2.91)]. Conventional serological assays in SARS-CoV-2 cases, such as the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, have a high-throughput advantage and minimize false-negative rates that occur with the RT-PCR method.

191,"Factors associated with COVID-19 related hospitalisation, critical care admission and mortality using linked primary and secondary care data","BackgroundTo identify risk factors associated with increased risk of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in inner North East London (NEL) during the first UK COVID-19 wave.

MethodsMultivariate logistic regression analysis on linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 01/02/2020-30/06/2020 determined odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality.

ResultsOver the study period 1,781 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1,195 (67%) were hospitalised, 152 (9%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the risk of hospitalisation. Obesity increased the risk of being admitted to ICU. Underlying CKD, stroke and dementia in-creased the risk of death. Having learning disabilities was strongly associated with increased risk of death (OR=4.75, 95%CI=(1.91,11.84), p=0.001). Having three or four co-morbidities increased the risk of hospitalisation (OR=2.34,95%CI=(1.55,3.54),p<0.001;OR=2.40, 95%CI=(1.55,3.73), p<0.001 respectively) and death (OR=2.61, 95%CI=(1.59,4.28), p<0.001;OR=4.07, 95% CI= (2.48,6.69), p<0.001 respectively).

ConclusionsWe confirm that age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, CKD and diabetes are important determinants of risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death.

192,Epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Scotland: a genomic perspective on the impact of the introduction and relaxation of lockdown on SARS-CoV-2,"The second SARS virus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019, and within a month was globally distributed. It was first introduced into Scotland in February 2020 associated with returning travellers and visitors. By March it was circulating in communities across the UK, and to control COVID-19 cases, and prevent overwhelming of the National Health Service (NHS), a  lockdown was introduced on 23rd March 2020 with a restriction of peoples movements. To augment the public health efforts a large-scale genome epidemiology effort (as part of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium) resulted in the sequencing of over 5000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes by 18th August 2020 from Scottish cases, about a quarter of the estimated number of cases at that time. Here we quantify the geographical origins of the first wave introductions into Scotland from abroad and other UK regions, the spread of these SARS-CoV-2 lineages to different regions within Scotland (defined at the level of NHS Health Board) and the effect of lockdown on virus  success. We estimate that approximately 300 introductions seeded lineages in Scotland, with around 25% of these lineages composed of more than five viruses, but by June circulating lineages were reduced to low levels, in line with low numbers of recorded positive cases. Lockdown was, thus, associated with a dramatic reduction in infection numbers and the extinguishing of most virus lineages. Unfortunately since the summer cases have been rising in Scotland in a second wave, with >1000 people testing positive on a daily basis, and hospitalisation of COVID-19 cases on the rise again. Examining the available Scottish genome data from the second wave, and comparing it to the first wave, we find that while some UK lineages have persisted through the summer, the majority of lineages responsible for the second wave are new introductions from outside of Scotland and many from outside of the UK. This indicates that, while lockdown in Scotland is directly linked with the first wave case numbers being brought under control, travel-associated imports (mostly from Europe or other parts of the UK) following the easing of lockdown are responsible for seeding the current epidemic population. This demonstrates that the impact of stringent public health measures can be compromised if following this, movements from regions of high to low prevalence are not minimised.",Samantha J Lycett; Joseph Hughes; Martin P McHugh; Ana Da Silva Filipe; Rebecca Dewar; Lu Lu; Thomas Doherty; Amy Shepherd; Rhys Inward; Gianluigi Rossi; Daniel Balaz; Rowland R Kao; Stefan Rooke; Seb Cotton; Michael D Gallagher; Carlos E Balcazar-Lopez; Aine O'Toole; Emily Scher; Verity Hill; John T McCrone; Rachel M Colquhoun; Ben Jackson; Thomas C Williams; Kathleen A Williamson; Natasha Johnson; Katherine Smollett; Daniel Mair; Stephen Carmichael; Lily Tong; Jenna Nichols; Kirstyn Brunker; James G Shepherd; Kathy Li; Elihu Aranday-Cortes; Yasmin A Parr; Alice Broos; Kyriaki Nomikou; Sarah E McDonald; Marc Niebel; Patawee Asamaphan; Igor Starinskij; Natasha Jesudason; Rajiv Shah; Vattipally B Sreenu; Tom Stanton; Sharif Shaaban; Alasdair MacLean; - The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium; Mark Woolhouse; Rory Gunson; Kate Templeton; Emma C Thomson; Andrew Rambaut; Matthew TG Holden; David L Robertson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20248677,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20248677,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
193,"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Iquitos, Loreto, Peru.","BackgroundDetection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people at risk is critical for understanding both the prior transmission of COVID-19 and vulnerability of the population to the continuing transmission and, when done serially, the intensity of ongoing transmission over an interval in a community. In this study, we estimated the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort of Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March 2020.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based study of transmission tested each participant using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test from Orient Gene Biotech and used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics. Here we report results from the baseline (13 to 18 July 2020) and the first month of follow-up (13 to 18 August 2020) study.

FindingsWe enrolled a total of 716 participants and estimated seroprevalence of 70.0% (95% CI: 67.0%-73.4%), a test-re-test positivity of 65% (95% CI: 61.0%-68.3%), and an incidence of new exposures of 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-3.2%) data that suggest that transmission is ongoing but is occurring at low levels. We observed significant differences in the seroprevalence between age groups, with participants 18 to 29 years of age having lower seroprevalence than children <12 years of age (Prevalence ratio =0.85 [PR]; 95% CI: 0.73 - 0.98), suggesting that children were not refractory to infection in this setting.

InterpretationIquitos demonstrates one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of COVID-19 worldwide. Current data shows a limited case burden in Iquitos for the past seven months and suggests that these levels are sufficient to provide significant but incomplete herd immunity.

Although human disease is often asymptomatic, some develop severe illnesses such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. There is an urgent need for a vaccine to prevent its rapid spread as asymptomatic infections accounting for up to 40% of transmission events. Here we further evaluated an inactivated rabies vectored SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine CORAVAX in a Syrian hamster model. CORAVAX adjuvanted with MPLA-AddaVax, a TRL4 agonist, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and generated a strong Th1-biased immune response. Vaccinated hamsters were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates three days after challenge with SARS-CoV-2.

196,Temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 mutation accumulation within and across infected hosts,"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity within infected hosts can provide insight into the generation and spread of new viral variants and may enable high resolution inference of transmission chains. However, little is known about temporal aspects of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost diversity and the extent to which shared diversity reflects convergent evolution as opposed to transmission linkage. Here we use high depth of coverage sequencing to identify within-host genetic variants in 325 specimens from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and infected employees at a single medical center. We validated our variant calling by sequencing defined RNA mixtures and identified a viral load threshold that minimizes false positives. By leveraging clinical metadata, we found that intrahost diversity is low and does not vary by time from symptom onset. This suggests that variants will only rarely rise to appreciable frequency prior to transmission. Although there was generally little shared variation across the sequenced cohort, we identified intrahost variants shared across individuals who were unlikely to be related by transmission. These variants did not precede a rise in frequency in global consensus genomes, suggesting that intrahost variants may have limited utility for predicting future lineages. These results provide important context for sequence-based inference in SARS-CoV-2 evolution and epidemiology.",Andrew L. Valesano; Kalee E. Rumfelt; Derek E. Dimcheff; Christopher N.

The aim of this study was to broaden the understanding of fully online distance learning from the experiences of undergraduate medical students and faculty members during confinement, and identify its key elements.

MethodsA convergent mixed methods study analyzing: (a) an online teaching follow- up program, (b) two focus groups and a nominal group with students and faculty, respectively, and (c) a survey with students from 1st to 5th year.

ResultsThirteen strongly interconnected categories were identified. Four played an organizational role: course planning, coordination, communication and pedagogical coherence. The remaining nine categories were: learning outcomes, teaching methodology, online resources, evaluation, time management, workload, student motivation, participation, and teacher-student relationship. Among the key aspects of learning were those that promoted rapport between faculty and students, such as synchronous sessions, especially those based on clinical cases.

In the UK, many universities opened for blended learning for the 2020-2021 academic year, with a mixture of face to face and online teaching. In this study we present a simulation framework to evaluate the effectiveness of different asymptomatic testing strategies within a university setting, across a range of transmission scenarios.

199,"Coevolutionary Analysis and Perturbation-Based Network Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Complexes with Antibodies: Binding-Induced Control of Dynamics, Allosteric Interactions and Signaling","The structural and biochemical studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and complexes with highly potent antibodies have revealed multiple conformation-dependent epitopes highlighting the link between conformational plasticity of spike proteins and capacity for eliciting specific binding and broad neutralization responses. In this study, we used coevolutionary analysis, molecular simulations, and perturbation-based hierarchical network modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 S complexes with H014, S309, S2M11 and S2E12 antibodies targeting distinct epitopes to explore molecular mechanisms underlying binding-induced modulation of dynamics, stability and allosteric signaling in the spike protein trimers. The results of this study revealed key regulatory centers that can govern allosteric interactions and communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Through coevolutionary analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we identified highly coevolving hotspots and functional clusters forming coevolutionary networks. The results revealed significant coevolutionary couplings between functional regions separated by the medium-range distances which may help to facilitate a functional cross-talk between distant allosteric regions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with antibodies. We also discovered a potential mechanism by which antibody-specific targeting of coevolutionary centers can allow for efficient modulation of allosteric interactions and signal propagation between remote functional regions. Using a hierarchical network modeling and perturbation-response scanning analysis, we demonstrated that binding of antibodies could leverage direct contacts with coevolutionary hotspots to allosterically restore and enhance couplings between spatially separated functional regions, thereby protecting the spike apparatus from membrane fusion. The results of this study also suggested that antibody binding can induce a switch from a moderately cooperative population-shift mechanism, governing structural changes of the ligand-free SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, to antibody-induced highly cooperative mechanism that can better withstand mutations in the functional regions without significant deleterious consequences for protein function. This study provides a novel insight into allosteric regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, showing that antibodies can modulate allosteric interactions and signaling of spike proteins, providing a plausible strategy for therapeutic intervention by targeting specific hotspots of allosteric interactions in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins.",Gennady Verkhivker; Luisa Di Paola,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427320,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427320,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,False
200,Estimating dates of origin and end of COVID-19 epidemics,"Estimating the date at which an epidemic started in a country and the date at which it can end depending on interventions intensity are important to guide public health responses. Both are potentially shaped by similar factors including stochasticity (due to small population sizes), super-spreading events, and memory effects. Focusing on COVID-19 epidemics, we develop and analyse mathematical models to explore how these three factors may affect early and final epidemic dynamics. Regarding the date of origin, we find limited effects on the mean estimates, but strong effects on their variances. Regarding the date of extinction following lock-down onset, mean values decrease with stochasticity or with the presence of superspreading events. These results underline the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in infection history and transmission patterns to make accurate predictions regarding epidemic temporal estimates.",Thomas Beneteau; Baptiste Elie; Mircea T Sofonea; Samuel Alizon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250080,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250080,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
201,Neutralizing and protective human monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N-terminaldomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Most human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 recognize the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain and block virus interactions with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. We describe a panel of human mAbs binding to diverse epitopes on the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors and found a minority of these possessed neutralizing activity. Two mAbs (COV2-2676 and COV2-2489) inhibited infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and recombinant VSV/SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We mapped their binding epitopes by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and selection of functional SARS-CoV-2 S neutralization escape variants. Mechanistic studies showed that these antibodies neutralize in part by inhibiting a post-attachment step in the infection cycle. COV2-2676 and COV2-2489 offered protection either as prophylaxis or therapy, and Fc effector functions were required for optimal protection. Thus, natural infection induces a subset of potent NTD-specific mAbs that leverage neutralizing and Fc-mediated activities to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection using multiple functional attributes.",Naveenchandra Suryadevara; Swathi Shrihari; Pavlo Gilchuk; Laura VanBlargan; Elad Binshtein; Seth Zost; Rachel Nargi; Rachel Sutton; Emma S Winkler; Elaine C Chen; Mallorie E.

202,A Universal Bacteriophage T4 Nanoparticle Platform to Design Multiplex SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidates by CRISPR Engineering,"A ""universal"" vaccine design platform that can rapidly generate multiplex vaccine candidates is critically needed to control future pandemics. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 pandemic virus as a model, we have developed such a platform by CRISPR engineering of bacteriophage T4. A pipeline of vaccine candidates were engineered by incorporating various viral components into appropriate compartments of phage nanoparticle structure. These include: expressible spike genes in genome, spike and envelope epitopes as surface decorations, and nucleocapsid proteins in packaged core. Phage decorated with spike trimers is found to be the most potent vaccine candidate in mouse and rabbit models. Without any adjuvant, this vaccine stimulated robust immune responses, both TH1 and TH2 IgG subclasses, blocked virus-receptor interactions, neutralized viral infection, and conferred complete protection against viral challenge. This new type of nanovaccine design framework might allow rapid deployment of effective phage-based vaccines against any emerging pathogen in the future.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427310,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427310,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,False

Although neither variant causes more severe illness or increased risk of death, the faster spread of the virus is a major threat. Using computational tools, we found that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants may acquire an increased transmissibility by increasing the propensity of its spike protein to expose the receptor binding domain. This information leads to the identification of potential treatments to avert the imminent threat of these more transmittable SARS-CoV-2 variants.

In this study, we conducted an in silico survey on SARS-CoV-2 sequence variability within the binding regions of primer/probe published by the Japan National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In silico analysis revealed the presence of mutations in the primer/probe binding regions.

The study involved 17 explosives detection dogs, two cadaver detection dogs and two dogs with no previous detection training. Training lasted two weeks before starting the validation protocol. Sequential five and seven-cone line-ups were used with axillary sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive) and from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative). A total of 1368 trials were performed during validation, including 151 positive and 110 negative samples. Each line-up had one positive sample and at least one negative sample. The dog had to mark the positive sample, randomly positioned behind one of the cones. The dog, handler and data recorder were blinded to the positive sample location.

The calculated overall sensitivities were between 71% and 79% for three dogs, between83% and 87% for three other dogs, and equal to or higher than 90% for the remaining 15 dogs (more than two thirds of the 21 dogs).

After calculating the overall sensitivity for each dog using all line-ups, ""matched"" sensitivities were calculated only including line-ups containing COVID-19 positive and negative samples strictly comparable on confounding factors such as diabetes, anosmia, asthma, fever, body pain, diarrhoea, sex, hospital, method of sweat collection and sampling duration. Most of the time, the sensitivities increased after matching.

Pandemic conditions in the U.A.E., associated with the desire to use dogs as an efficient mass-pretesting tool has already led to the operational deployment of the study dogs.

206,GRP78 binds SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2 and GRP78 depleting antibody blocks viral entry and infection in vitro,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the current COVID-19 global pandemic, utilizes the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry. However, other host factors may also play major roles in viral infection. Here we report that the stress-inducible molecular chaperone GRP78 can form a complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2 intracellularly and on the cell surface, and that the substrate binding domain of GRP78 is critical for this function. Knock-down of GRP78 by siRNA dramatically reduced cell surface ACE2 expression. Treatment of lung epithelial cells with a humanized monoclonal antibody (hMAb159), selected for its ability to cause GRP78 endocytosis and its safe clinical profile in preclinical models, reduces cell surface ACE2 expression, SARS-CoV-2 Spike-driven viral entry, and significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

207,Exploring overcrowding trends in an inner city emergence department in the UK before and during COVID-19 epidemic,"BackgroundWe compared impact of three pre-COVID-19 interventions and of the COVID-19 UK-epidemic and the first UK national lockdown on overcrowding within University College London Hospital Emergency Department (UCLH ED). The three interventions: target the influx of patients at ED (A), reduce the pressure on in-patients beds (B) and improve ED processes to improve the flow of patents out from ED (C).

MethodsWe analysed the change in overcrowding metrics (daily attendances, the proportion of people leaving within four hours of arrival (four-hours target) and the reduction in overall waiting time) across three analysis. The first analysis used data 01/04/2017-31/12-2019 to calculate changes over a period of six months before and after the start of interventions A-C. The second and third analyses focused on evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, comparing the first 10 months in 2020 and 2019, and of the first national lockdown (23/03/2020-31/05/2020).

ResultsPre-COVID-19 all interventions led to small reductions in waiting time (17%, p<0.001 for A and C;9%, p=0.322 for B) but also to a small decrease in the number of patients leaving within four hours of arrival (6.6%,7.4%,6.2% respectively A-C,p<0.001).

In presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance and waiting time were reduced (40% and 8%;p<0.001), and the number of people leaving within four hours of arrival was increased (6%,p<0.001). During the first lockdown, there was 65% reduction in attendance, 22% reduction in waiting time and 8% increase in number of people leaving within 4 hours of arrival (p<0.001). Crucially, when the lockdown was lifted, there was an increase (6.5%,p<0.001) in the percentage of people leaving within four hours, together with a larger (12.5%,p<0.001) decrease in waiting time. This occurred despite the increase of 49.6%(p<0.001) in attendance after lockdown ended.

ConclusionsThe mixed results pre-COVID-19 (significant improvements in waiting time with some interventions but not improvement in the four-hours target), may be due to a  spill-over effect where clogging up one part of the ED system affects other parts. Hence multifaceted interventions and a system-wide approach to improve the pathway of flow through the ED system is necessary.

During 2020 and in presence of the COVID-19 epidemic, a shift in public behaviour with anxiety over attending hospitals and higher use of virtual consultations, led to notable drop in UCLH ED attendance and consequential curbing of overcrowding.

Importantly, once the lockdown was lifted, although there was an increase in arrivals at UCLH ED, overcrowding metrics were reduced. Thus, the combination of shifted public behaviour and the restructuring changes during COVID-19 epidemic, maybe be able to curb future ED overcrowding, but longer timeframe analysis is required to confirm this.",Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths; Jack Ross; Samer Elkhodair; Christopher Baxter-Derrington; Chris Laing; Rosalind Raine,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250150,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21250150,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
208,Sleep in Frontline Healthcare Workers on Social Media During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"ImportanceDuring the pandemic, healthcare workers on social media are sharing their challenges, including sleep disturbances.

ObjectiveTo assess sleep using validated measures among frontline healthcare workers on social media

DesignA self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31-September 15, 2020) targeting healthcare workers (HCW) who were clinically active during the pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and reported demographic/career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI>5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI>14. The mini-Z was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes.

SettingOnline self-selection survey on social media

Participants963 surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly White (92.8%), female (73.4%), aged 30-49 (71.9%), and physicians (64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 (SD 1.2) hours. Nearly 90% reported poor sleep (PSQI). One third (33.0%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many (60%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device usage or had bad dreams at least once per week (45%). Over 50% reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, non-physician (OR 2.4; CI: 1.7, 3.4), caring for COVID-19 patients (OR 1.8; CI 1.2, 2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2; CI: 1.4, 3.5), being female (OR 1.6; CI 1.1, 2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3; CI 2.7,6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia. In open-ended comments (n=310), poor sleep mapped to four categories: children and family, work demands, personal health, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances.

ConclusionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, 90% of frontline healthcare workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device usage and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline healthcare workers are urgently needed.

209,Deficient hand washing facilities in public toilets in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey in one high-income country,"AimsTo identify the extent of the provision of water and soap for hand washing in public toilets at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. To also make comparisons with a pre-pandemic survey that included a sample of the same facilities.

MethodsWe collected data from 400 toilets that were open to the public; all those in three contiguous city council territories (228) and a further convenience sample of 172 around the rest of New Zealand. Comparisons were made with the data on the same facilities included in a 2012/2013 survey.

ResultsFor all the toilets in this survey, 2.5% had no water for hand washing and 14.8% had no soap. There was COVID-19 related health messaging signage in 19.5% of toilets, with posters of the COVID-19 QR code used to facilitate contact tracing in 12.3%, and generic hand washing signage in 1.8%. The hand washing water had ""no touch"" activation at 28.0% of toilets and at 18.5% for toilet bowl flushing. Toilet bowl lids were not present at 32.8%, and 2.3% of toilets had damage which would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats). For the 128 sites that had also been examined in the previous survey, this new survey found significantly increased provision of soap (risk ratio = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.25 to 1.72), but no increased provision of water.

ConclusionsDespite the serious threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of hand washing facilities in public toilets sampled required tap touching, and did not have health messaging. Nevertheless there has been some modest improvements in soap (but not water) provision since the previous survey eight years before.",Nick Wilson; George Thomson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250124,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250124,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
210,Head-to-head comparison of direct-input RT-PCR and RT-LAMP against RTqPCR on extracted RNA for rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics,"Viral pandemics, such as Covid-19, pose serious threats to human societies. To control the spread of highly contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, effective test-trace-isolate strategies require population-wide, systematic testing. Currently, RT-qPCR on extracted RNA is the only broadly accepted test for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, which bears the risk of supply chain bottlenecks, often exaggerated by dependencies on proprietary reagents. Here, we directly compare the performance of gold standard diagnostic RT-qPCR on extracted RNA to direct input RT-PCR, RT-LAMP and bead-LAMP on 384 primary patient samples collected from individuals with suspected Covid-19 infection. With a simple five minute crude sample inactivation step and one hour of total reaction time, we achieve assay sensitivities of 98% (direct RT-PCR), 93% (bead-LAMP) and 82% (RT-LAMP) for clinically relevant samples (diagnostic RT-qPCR Ct <35) and a specificity of >98%. For direct RT-PCR, our data further demonstrate a perfect agreement between real-time and end-point measurements, which allow a simple binary classification similar to the powerful visual readout of colorimetric LAMP assays.

211,The N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2 spike leads to morbidity in obese and aged mice and is neutralized by convalescent and post-vaccination human sera,"The current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, disproportionally affects the elderly and people with comorbidities like obesity and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus. Small animal models are crucial for the successful development and validation of antiviral vaccines, therapies and to study the role that comorbidities have on the outcome of viral infections. The initially available SARS-CoV-2 isolates require adaptation in order to use the mouse angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (mACE-2) entry receptor and to productively infect the cells of the murine respiratory tract. We have ""mouse-adapted"" SARS-CoV-2 by serial passaging a clinical virus isolate in the lungs of mice. We then used low doses of this virus in mouse models for advanced age, diabetes and obesity. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the outcome of infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 resulted in enhanced morbidity in aged and diabetic obese mice. Mutations associated with mouse adaptation occurred in the S, M, N and ORF8 genes. Interestingly, one mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S protein results in the change of an asparagine to tyrosine residue at position 501 (N501Y). This mutation is also present in the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses reported in the U.K. (20B/501Y.V1, B1.1.7 lineage) that is epidemiologically associated with high human to human transmission. We show that human convalescent and post vaccination sera can neutralize the newly emerging N501Y virus variant with similar efficiency as that of the reference USA-WA1/2020 virus, suggesting that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will protect against the 20B/501Y.V1 strain.",Raveen Rathnasinghe; Sonia Jangra; Anastasija Cupic; Carles Martinez-Romero; Lubbertus C.F.

212,Excessive matrix metalloproteinase-1 and hyperactivation of endothelial cells occurred in COVID-19 patients and were associated with the severity of COVID-19,"COVID-19 starts as a respiratory disease that can progress to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and multi-organ failure. Growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 is a systemic illness that primarily injures the vascular endothelium, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. SARS-CoV-2 infection is believed to trigger a cytokine storm that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of endothelialitis and vascular injury, eventually leading to respiratory and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients. We used a multiplex immunoassay to systematically profile and compare 65 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/growth factors in plasma samples from 24 hospitalized (severe/critical) COVID-19 patients, 14 mild/moderate cases, and 13 healthy controls (HCs). Patients with severe/critical and mild/moderate COVID-19 had significantly higher plasma levels of 20 analytes than HCs. Surprisingly, only one cytokine (MIF) was among these altered analytes, while the rest were chemokines and growth factors. In addition, only MMP-1 and VEGF-A were significantly elevated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to mild/moderate cases. Given that excessive MMP-1 plays a central role in tissue destruction in a wide variety of vascular diseases and that elevated VEGF-A, an EC activation marker, increases vascular permeability, we further studied MMP-1 enzymatic activity and other EC activation markers such as soluble forms of CD146, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. We found that plasma MMP-1 enzymatic activity and plasma levels of MMP-1 and EC activation markers were highly dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. Some dysregulations were associated with patients age or gender, but not with race. Our results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients have distinct inflammatory profiles that are distinguished from the cytokine storms in other human diseases. Excessive MMP-1 and hyperactivation of ECs occur in COVID-19 patients and are associated with the severity of COVID-19.",Fahim Syed; Wei Li; Ryan F Relich; Patrick M Russell; Shanxiang Zhang; Michelle K Zimmerman; Qigui Yu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250115,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250115,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
213,Overcrowding and Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Increase Risk for COVID-19 Infection Among Latinx Families in Greater San Francisco Bay Area,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted the Latinx community in the United States. Environmental risk factors, including community level pollution burden and exposure to smoking and secondhand smoke, have not been evaluated in relation to risk for infection with COVID-19.

MethodsWe evaluated self-reported infection rates of COVID-19 in three, preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx family cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area from May through September 2020 (N=383 households, 1,875 people). All households were enrolled during pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF Benioff before the pandemic. For the COVID-19 sub-study, participants responded to a 15-minute telephonic interview where we assessed food consumption patterns, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection based on community and hospital-based testing. We also evaluated secondhand smoke exposure based on previously collected data. Environmental pollution exposure was determined from census tract residence using Californias EnviroScreen 2.0 data. Non-parametric tests were used to assess possible associations and multiple logistic regression analyses to determine independent predictors of COVID-19 infection.

ResultsIn the combined Latinx, Eating and Diabetes Cohort (LEAD) and Hispanic, Eating and Nutrition (HEN) cohorts there was a 7.6% household infection rate (14/183) with a lower rate of 3.5% (7/200) in the Telomeres at Birth (TAB) cohort. Larger household size increased risk for infection (OR, 1.43 (95%CI 1.10-1.87)) in the combined LEAD/HEN cohorts and increasing number of children trended towards significance in the TAB cohort (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.98-3.37). Any exposure to secondhand smoke in the household also trended towards increasing risk after adjusting for household size and other exposures (OR 3.20, 95%CI 0.80-12.73) and (OR 4.37, 95% CI 0.80-23.70). We did not find any associations between neighborhood pollution level based on census track and risk of infection. Furthermore, we found weak evidence between dietary exposure and risk of COVID-19 infection after adjusting for possible confounders.

ConclusionCrowding as indicated by household size increases risk for COVID-19 infection in Latinx families. Exposure to any secondhand smoke may also increase risk for COVID-19 through increased coughing and risk for respiratory impairment. Public policy and health interventions need to ensure that multiunit residential complexes prevent any exposure to secondhand smoke.",Andrea DeCastro Mendez; Milagro Escobar; Maria Romero Encinas; Janet Wojcicki,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250139,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250139,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
214,A Label-Free SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test and a Longitudinal Study of Antibody Characteristics in COVID-19 Patients,"BackgroundThe laboratory-based methods to measure the SARS-CoV-2 humoral response include virus neutralization tests (VNTs) to determine antibody neutralization potency. For ease of use and universal applicability, surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated blockage of molecular interactions have been proposed.

MethodsA surrogate virus neutralization test established on a label-free immunoassay platform (LF-sVNT). The LF-sVNT analyzes the binding ability of RBD to ACE2 after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum.

ResultsThe LF-sVNT neutralizing antibody titers (IC50) were determined from serum samples (n=246) from COVID-19 patients (n=113), as well as the IgG concentrations and the IgG avidity indices. Although there is variability in the kinetics of the IgG concentrations and neutralizing antibody titers between individuals, there is an initial rise, plateau and then in some cases a gradual decline at later timepoints after 40 days post-symptom onset. The IgG avidity indices, in the same cases, plateau after the initial rise and did not show a decline.

ConclusionsThe LF-sVNT can be a valuable tool in clinical laboratories for the assessment of the presence of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. This study is the first to provide longitudinal neutralizing antibody titers beyond 200 days post-symptom onset. Despite the decline of IgG concentration and neutralizing antibody titer, IgG avidity index increases, reaches a plateau and then remains constant up to 8 months post-infection. The decline of antibody neutralization potency can be attributed to the reduction in antibody quantity rather than the deterioration of antibody avidity, a measure of antibody quality.

SummaryA surrogate virus neutralization test established on a label-free immunoassay platform (LF-sVNT).

215,Modeling the population effects of epitope specific escape mutations in SARS-CoV-2 to guide vaccination strategies,"Escape mutations (EM) to SARS-Cov-2 have been detected and are spreading. Vaccines may need adjustment to respond to these or future mutations. We designed a population level model integrating both waning immunity and EM. We also designed a set of criteria for elaborating and fitting this model to cross-neutralization and other data in a manner that minimizes vaccine decision errors. We formulated four model variations. These define criteria for which prior infections provide immunity that can be escaped. They also specify different sequences where one EM follows another. At all reasonable parameter values, these model variations led to patterns where: 1) EM were rare in the first epidemic, 2) rebound epidemics after the first epidemic were accelerated more by increasing drifting than by increasing waning (with some exceptions), 3) the long term endemic level of infection was determined mostly by waning rates with small effects of the drifting parameter, 4) EM caused loss of vaccine effectiveness and under some conditions, vaccines induced EM that caused higher levels of infection with vaccines than without them. The differences and similarities across the four models suggest paths for developing models specifying the epitopes where EM act. This model is a base on which to construct epitope specific evolutionary models using new high-throughput assay data from population samples to guide vaccine decisions.

HighlightsO_LIThis model is the first to integrate both antigenic drifting from escape mutations and immunity waning in continuous time.
C_LIO_LITiny amounts of only waning or only escape mutation drifting have small or no effects. Together, they have large effects.
C_LIO_LIThere are no or few escape mutations during the first epidemic peak and no effect of drifting parameters on the size of that wave.
C_LIO_LIAfter the first epidemic peak, escape mutations accumulate rapidly. They increase with increases in waning rates and with increases in the drifting rate. Escape mutations then amplify other escape mutations since these raise the frequency of reinfections.
C_LIO_LIEscape mutations can completely negate the effects of vaccines and even lead to more infections with vaccination than without, especially at very low waning rates.
C_LIO_LIThe model generates population level cross-neutralization patterns that enable the model to be fitted to population level serological data.
C_LIO_LIThe model can be modified to use laboratory data that determine the epitope specific effects of mutations on ACE2 attachment strength or escape from antibody effects.
C_LIO_LIThe model, although currently unable to predict the effects of escape mutations in the real world, opens up a path that can guide model incorporation of molecularly studied escape mutations and improve predictive value. We describe that path.
C_LIO_LIModel analysis indicates that vaccine trials and serological surveys are needed now to detect the effects of epitope specific escape mutations that could cause the loss of vaccine efficacy.

217,"Hyperinflammatory conditions, gender differences and mortality in Indian COVID-19 patients","PurposeEvidence suggests that COVID-19 induces hyperinflammatory conditions and causes relatively more deaths in males than females. The purpose of this study was to analyze gender differences associated with various hyperinflammatory conditions (HIC) and mortality in the Indian COVID-19 patients

MethodsThis study was conducted at the Eras Lucknow Medical College and Hospital (ELMCH), ERA University, which is located in the northern part of India. Starting from July 4, 2020 till December 3, 2020 a total of 2997 patients were treated at ELMCH. We randomly collected blood samples from 150 severe COVID-19 patients (required oxygen) between August 10 and September 15, 2020 for analyzing the following HIC and associated laboratory markers: hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin), hematological dysfunctions (lymphocytopenia and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio), cytokinaemia (C-reactive protein), coagulopathy (D-dimer), liver inflammation (aspartate aminotransferase), renal inflammation (blood urea and creatinine), and hyperglycemia (random blood glucose). The threshold values/cut off limits of these laboratory markers used for analyzing the risk of mortality in male and female COVID-19 patients were set according to the scale validated recently by Webb et al, (2020).

ResultsIn the above cohort of consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients, analysis of various HIC revealed hyperferritinaemia (odd ratio: 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.0), hematological dysfunctions (odd ratio: 2.10, 95% CI 1.0-4.2), hepatic inflammation (odd ratio: 2.0, 95% CI 0.52-7.40), and coagulopathy (odd ratio: 1.5, 95% CI 1.50, 95% CI 0.50-4.60) were more prevalent and sever in male COVID-19 patients. Approximately 86% male to 64% female COVID-19 patients developed lymphocytopenia. Regarding mortality, while hyperferritinaemia (odd ratio: 1.70, 95% CI 0.37-7.43) and cytokinaemia (odd ratio: 1.60, 95% CI 0.37 -7.30) were strongly associated with mortality in male COVID-19 patients, coagulopathy (odd ratio: 3.30, 95% CI 0.31-35), and hematological dysfunctions (odd ratio: 1.70, 95% CI 0.27-10) were more commonly associated with mortality in female COVID-19 patients. Nearly 80% male and female COVID-19 patients, who died had developed [&ge;]2 criteria of HIS criteria. Chronic renal disease was associated with more deaths in female than male COVID-19 patients (odd ratio: 2.0, 95% CI 0.54 - 7.4). While the mortality proportion was slightly higher in male (6.3%) than female (4.5%) COVID-19 patients, survival curves of the two genders were not different (hazard ratio: 1.02, 95% CI 0.71-1.40, P = 0. 953).

ConclusionDistinct HIC were associated with the severity, and mortality in male and female COVID-19 patients. Coagulopathy and renal injury were detrimental, specifically, for female COVID-19 patients. The overall mortality proportion was around 5.3%. The above results suggest that gender differences associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality arise due to differences in various HIC.

218,Impact of immediate and preferential relaxation of social and travel restrictions for vaccinated people on the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 : a model-based analysis,"BackgroundFour COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer, Moderna, University of Oxford/ Astra Zeneca (also Oxford/ Serum Institute of India) and ICMR/ Bharat Biotech have been granted emergency use authorization in the democratic world following established clinical trial procedures in their respective countries. Vaccination of the general public is expected to begin in several weeks. We consider the question of whether people who have received the vaccine can be selectively and immediately cleared to return to normal activities, including hassle-free travel.

MethodsWe use a delay differential equation model developed previously by our group to calculate the effects of vaccinee ""immunity passports"" on the spreading trajectories of the disease. We consider default virus strains as well as high-transmissibility variants such as B1.1.7 in our analysis.

ResultsWe find that with high vaccine efficacy of 80 percent or greater, vaccinees may be immediately cleared for normal life with no significant increase in case counts. Free travel of such vaccinees between two regions should not jeopardize the infection control performance of either. At current vaccine administration rates, it may be eight months or more before COVID-19 transmission is significantly reduced or eliminated. With lower vaccine efficacy of approximately 60 percent however, social as well as travel restrictions for vaccinees may need to remain in place until transmission of the disease is eliminated.

ConclusionsDesigning high-efficacy vaccines with easily scalable manufacturing and distribution capacity should remain on the priority list in academic as well as industrial circles. Performance of all vaccines should continue to be monitored in real time during vaccination drive with a view to analysing socio-demographic determinants if any of efficacy, and optimizing distribution accordingly. A speedy and efficacious vaccination drive will provide the smoothest path out of the pandemic with the least additional caseloads, death toll and socioeconomic cost.",B Shayak; Mohit Manoj Sharma; Anand Kumar Mishra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250100,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250100,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
219,The Association of COVID-19 Incidence with Sport and Face Mask Use in United States High School Athletes,"PurposeTo evaluate the influence of sport characteristics and face mask use on COVID-19 incidence among high school athletes.

MethodsSurveys were distributed to high school athletic directors throughout the United States regarding sport re-initiation, COVID-19 cases, and risk reduction procedures in fall 2020.

Separate mixed effects Poisson regression models were developed to evaluate the associations between reported COVID-19 incidence and 1) sport characteristics (contact/non-contact, individual/team, indoor/outdoor) and 2) face mask use while playing (yes/no).

Results991 schools had restarted fall sports, representing 152,484 athletes on 5,854 teams. 2,565 cases of COVID-19 were reported, representing a case rate of 1,682 cases per 100,000 athletes and an incidence rate of 24.6 cases per 100,000 player-days. COVID-19 incidence was lower among outdoor versus indoor sports (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.54, 95% CI=0.49-0.60, p<0.001) and non-contact versus contact sports (IRR=0.78 [0.70-0.87], p<0.001), but not team versus individual sports (IRR=0.96 [0.84-1.1], p=0.49). Face mask use was associated with a decreased incidence in girls volleyball (IRR=0.53 [0.37-0.73], p<0.001), boys basketball (IRR=0.53 [0.33-0.83], p=0.008) and girls basketball (IRR=0.36 [0.19-0.63], p<0.001), and approached statistical significance in football (IRR=0.79 [0.59-1.04], p=0.10) and cheer/dance (IRR=0.75 [0.53-1.03], p=0.081).

ConclusionsIn this nationwide survey of US high school athletic directors representing 152,484 athletes, lower COVID-19 incidence was independently associated with participation in outdoor versus indoor and non-contact versus contact sports, but not team versus individual sports. Face mask use was associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence among indoor sports, and may be protective among outdoor sports with prolonged close contact between participants.",Andrew Watson; Kristin Haraldsdottir; Kevin Biese; Leslie Goodavish; Bethany Stevens; Timothy McGuine,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250116,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.21250116,2021-01-20,2021-01-20,,True
220,Invasive Mould Disease in Fatal COVID-1 19: A Systematic Review of Autopsies,"BackgroundInvasive mould disease (IMD) - most commonly pulmonary aspergillosis - is reported to affect up to a third of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Most reported cases are diagnosed with probable/putative COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) based on a combination of non-specific clinical, radiographic, and mycological findings, but the clinical significance - and whether these cases represent true invasive disease - is unresolved.

MethodsWe performed a systematic review of autopsy series of decedents with COVID-19 for evidence of IMD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, OVID (Embase) and MedRxiv for English- or French-language case series published between January 1, 2019 to September 26, 2020. We included series describing lung histology of [&ge;]3 decedents, and authors were contacted for missing information as necessary.

FindingsWe identified 51 case series describing autopsies of 702 decedents. Individual-level data was available for 430 decedents. The median age was 72 (IQR 61 to 80) years. Diabetes mellitus, pre-existing lung disease, and immunocompromising conditions were reported for 129 (32%), 95 (22%), and 25 (6%) decedents, respectively. The median hospitalization length was 10 (IQR 5-22) days. 51.6% of decedents had received mechanical ventilation for a median of nine (IQR 5-20) days. Treatment included immunomodulation in 60 (most often steroids or tocilizumab) and antifungals in 41 decedents. Eleven decedents (1{middle dot}6%) had autopsy-confirmed IMD (6 with CAPA, 4 with invasive pulmonary mycosis not specified and 1 with disseminated mucormycosis). Among 173 decedents who received mechanical ventilation, 5 had IMD (2{middle dot}9%).

InterpretationAutopsy-proven IMD, including CAPA, is uncommon in fatal COVID-19.

This variant has an unusually large number of mutations with 10 amino acid changes in the spike protein, raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 16 participants in a previously reported trial with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had equivalent neutralizing titers to both variants.

223,mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants,"To date severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected nearly 100 million individuals resulting in over two million deaths. Many vaccines are being deployed to prevent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) including two novel mRNA-based vaccines1,2. These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known3-5. Here we report on the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers3,5. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection6,7. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.",Zijun Wang; Fabian Schmidt; Yiska Weisblum; Frauke Muecksch; Christopher O Barnes; Shlomo Finkin; Dennis Schaefer-Babajew; Melissa Cipolla; Christian Gaebler; Jenna A Lieberman; Zhi Yang; Morgan E Abernathy; Kathryn E Huey-Tubman; Arlene Hurley; Martina Turroja; Kamille A West; Kristie Gordon; Katrina G Millard; Victor Ramos; Justin Da Silva; Jianliang Xu; Robert A Colbert; Roshni Patel; Juan P Dizon; Irina Shimeliovich; Anna Gazumyan; Marina Caskey; Pamela J Bjorkman; Rafael Casellas; Theodora Hatziioannou; Paul D Bieniasz; Michel C Nussenzweig,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426911,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426911,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
224,Rapid protection from COVID-19 in nonhuman primates vaccinated intramuscularly but not intranasally with a single dose of a recombinant vaccine,"The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to exert a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10 days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (IN) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to control animals. While IM and IN vaccination both induced neutralizing antibody titers, only IM vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of IM-vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data demonstrates that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study.

Here, we investigate the intramolecular and intermolecular RNA interactions of wildtype (WT) and a mutant ({Delta}382) SARS-CoV-2 virus in cells using high throughput structure probing on Illumina and Nanopore platforms. We identified twelve potentially functional structural elements within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, observed that identical sequences can fold into divergent structures on different subgenomic RNAs, and that WT and {Delta}382 virus genomes can fold differently. Proximity ligation sequencing experiments identified hundreds of intramolecular and intermolecular pair-wise interactions within the virus genome and between virus and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 binds strongly to mitochondrial and small nucleolar RNAs and is extensively 2-O-methylated. 2-O-methylation sites in the virus genome are enriched in the untranslated regions and are associated with increased pair-wise interactions. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a global decrease of 2-O-methylation sites on host mRNAs, suggesting that binding to snoRNAs could be a pro-viral mechanism to sequester methylation machinery from host RNAs towards the virus genome.

ACE2 is a SARS-Cov-2 receptor and changes in its renal expression have been linked to several human nephropathies. These changes were never analyzed in context of dACE2, as its expression was not investigated in the kidney. We used Human Primary Proximal Tubule (HPPT) cells to show genome-wide gene expression patterns after cytokine stimulation, with emphasis on the ACE2/dACE2 locus. Putative regulatory elements controlling dACE2 expression were identified using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. qRT-PCR differentiating between ACE2 and dACE2 revealed 300- and 600-fold upregulation of dACE2 by IFN and IFN{beta}, respectively, while full length ACE2 expression was almost unchanged. JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib ablated STAT1 and dACE2 expression after interferon treatment. Finally, with RNA-seq, we identified a set of genes, largely immune-related, induced by cytokine treatment.

229,The impact of Spike mutations on SARS-CoV-2 neutralization,"Multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown protective efficacy, which is most likely mediated by neutralizing antibodies recognizing the viral entry protein, Spike. Antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infection neutralize the virus by focused targeting of Spike and there is limited serum cross-neutralization of the closely-related SARS-CoV. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants are rapidly emerging, exemplified by the B.1.1.7, 501Y.V2 and P.1 lineages, it is critical to understand if antibody responses induced by infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus or the current vaccines will remain effective against virus variants. In this study we evaluate neutralization of a series of mutated Spike pseudotypes including a B.1.1.7 Spike pseudotype. The analyses of a panel of Spike-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that the neutralizing activity of some antibodies was dramatically reduced by Spike mutations. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies in the serum of patients infected in early 2020 remained active against most mutated Spike pseudotypes. The majority of serum samples were equally able to neutralize the B.1.1.7 Spike pseudotype, however potency was reduced in a small number of samples (3 of 36) by 5-10-fold.

230,Experimental re-infected cats do not transmit SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and responsible for the current global pandemic. We and others have previously demonstrated that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can efficiently transmit the virus to naive cats. Here, we address whether cats previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2. In two independent studies, SARS-CoV-2-infected cats were re-challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 21 days post primary challenge (DPC) and necropsies performed at 4, 7 and 14 days post-secondary challenge (DP2C). Sentinels were co-mingled with the re-challenged cats at 1 DP2C. Clinical signs were recorded, and nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs, blood, and serum were collected and tissues examined for histologic lesions. Viral RNA was transiently shed via the nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal cavities of the re-challenged cats. Viral RNA was detected in various tissues of re-challenged cats euthanized at 4 DP2C, mainly in the upper respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues, but less frequently and at lower levels in the lower respiratory tract when compared to primary SARS-CoV-2 challenged cats at 4 DPC. Histologic lesions that characterized primary SARS-CoV-2 infected cats at 4 DPC were absent in the re-challenged cats. Naive sentinels co-housed with the re-challenged cats did not shed virus or seroconvert. Together, our results indicate that cats previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be experimentally re-infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, the levels of virus shed was insufficient for transmission to co-housed naive sentinels. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats induces immune responses that provide partial, non-sterilizing immune protection against reinfection.",Natasha N Gaudreault; Mariano Carossino; Igor Morozov; Jessie D Trujillo; David A Meekins; Daniel W Madden; Konner Cool; Bianca Libanori Artiaga; Chester McDowell; Dashzeveg Bold; Velmurugan Balaraman; Taeyong Kwon; Wenjun Ma; Jamie Henningson; Dennis W Wilson; William C Wilson; Udeni BR Balasuriya; Adolfo Garcia-Sastre; Juergen A Richt,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427182,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427182,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
231,A trans-complementation system for SARS-CoV-2,"The biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) requirement to culture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bottleneck for research and countermeasure development. Here we report a trans-complementation system that produces single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 that recapitulates authentic viral replication. We demonstrate that the single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput neutralization and antiviral testing. The trans-complementation system consists of two components: a genomic viral RNA containing a deletion of ORF3 and envelope gene, and a producer cell line expressing the two deleted genes. Trans-complementation of the two components generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round, but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose. The results suggest that the trans-complementation platform can be safely used at BSL-2 laboratories for research and countermeasure development.",Xianwen Zhang; Yang Liu; Jianying Liu; Adam L Bailey; Kenneth S Plante; Jessica A Plante; Jing Zou; Hongjie Xia; Nathen E Bopp; Patricia V Aguilar; Ping Ren; Vineet D Menachery; Michael S Diamond; Scott C Weaver; Xuping Xie; Pei-Yong Shi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.426970,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.426970,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False

233,BRD2 inhibition blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro by reducing transcription of the host cell receptor ACE2,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells is initiated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its cell-surface receptor ACE2. We conducted an unbiased CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways controlling Spike protein binding to human cells. We found that the protein BRD2 is an essential node in the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription in human lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently evaluated in clinical trials potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells. BRD2 also controls transcription of several other genes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the interferon response, which in turn regulates ACE2 levels. It is possible that the previously reported interaction between the viral E protein and BRD2 evolved to manipulate the transcriptional host response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results pinpoint BRD2 as a potent and essential regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential of BRD2 as a novel therapeutic target for COVID-19.",Ruilin Tian; Avi J Samelson; Veronica V Rezelj; Merissa Chen; Gokul N Ramadoss; Xiaoyan Guo; Alice Mac Kain; Quang Dinh Tran; Shion A Lim; Irene Lui; James Nunez; Sarah J Rockwood; Na Liu; Jared Carlson-Stevermer; Jennifer Oki; Travis Maures; Kevin Holden; Jonathan S Weissman; James A Wells; Bruce Conklin; Marco Vignuzzi; Martin Kampmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427194,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.19.427194,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False
234,Sterically-Confined Rearrangements of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Control Cell Invasion,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious, and transmission involves a series of processes that may be targeted by vaccines and therapeutics. During transmission, host cell invasion is controlled by a large-scale conformational change of the Spike protein. This conformational rearrangement leads to membrane fusion, which creates transmembrane pores through which the viral genome is passed to the host. During Spike-protein-mediated fusion, the fusion peptides must be released from the core of the protein and associate with the host membrane. Interestingly, the Spike protein possesses many post-translational modifications, in the form of branched glycans that flank the surface of the assembly. Despite the large number of glycosylation sites, until now, the specific role of glycans during cell invasion has been unclear. Here, we propose that glycosylation is needed to provide sufficient time for the fusion peptides to reach the host membrane, otherwise the viral particle would fail to enter the host. To understand this process, an all-atom model with simplified energetics was used to perform thousands of simulations in which the protein transitions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These simulations indicate that the steric composition of the glycans induces a pause during the Spike protein conformational change. We additionally show that this glycan-induced delay provides a critical opportunity for the fusion peptides to capture the host cell. This previously-unrecognized role of glycans reveals how the glycosylation state can regulate infectivity of this pervasive pathogen.",Esteban Dodero Rojas; Jose Nelson Onuchic; Paul Whitford,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427189,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.18.427189,2021-01-19,2021-01-19,,False

237,Acute Endotheliitis (Type 3 Hypersensitivity Vasculitis) in Ten COVID-19 Autopsy Brains,"Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in COVID-19 may occur through direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion through peripheral or cranial nerves or through vascular endothelial cell infection. The renin-angiotensin system may play a major part in CNS morbidity. Effects of hypoxia have also been implicated in CNS lesions in COVID-19. This communication reports on ten consecutive autopsies of individuals with death due to COVID-19 with decedent survival ranging from 30 minutes to 84 days after admission. All ten brains examined had neutrophilic microvascular endotheliitis present in variable amounts and variably distributed. Importantly, this acute stage of type 3 hypersensitivity vasculitis can be followed by fibrinoid necrosis and inner vascular wall sclerosis, but these later stages were not found.

238,Correlates of and changes in aerobic physical activity and strength training before and after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Findings from the HEBECO study.,"ObjectivesUnderstanding changes in moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity (MVPA) and strength training (MSA) from before to after (pre-/post-) the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK (first lockdown) and their correlates can inform interventions.

MethodsCross-sectional analysis of retrospective and concurrent data on MVPA/MSA pre- and post-Covid-19 (until 14th June 2020) among 2,657 UK adults. The associations between socio-demographic and health characteristics, MVPA/MSA pre-Covid-19, living and exercise conditions and meeting WHO recommended levels for MVPA/MSA/both (vs meeting neither), and changes in MVPA/MSA from pre-to post-Covid-19 following stratification for pre-Covid-19 MVPA/MSA levels were evaluated.

ResultsA third of adults maintained (30.4%), decreased (36.2%) or increased (33.4%) their MVPA levels post-Covid-19. For MSA, the percentages were 61.6%, 18.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. MVPA increased or decreased by an average of 150min/week, and MSA by 2 days/week. Meeting both MSA+MVPA recommendations during lockdown (vs. meeting neither) was positively associated with meeting MVPA+MSA pre-lockdown (aOR=16.11,95%CI=11.24-23.07), and post-16-years of age education (aOR=1.57,1.14-2.17), and negatively associated with being obese (aOR=0.49,0.33-0.73), older age (65+ vs [&le;]34; aOR=.53.32-.87), and annual household income <50.000GBP (vs [&ge;]50.000GBP; aOR=0.65,0.46-0.91). The odds for decreasing MVPA were significantly lower for white ethnicity, post-16-years of age education, access to garden/balcony, and higher for those who were in total isolation. The odds for decreasing MSA were significantly higher for those who were overweight or obese.

ConclusionAerobic and strength training were differently impacted during the first UK lockdown, with poorer outcomes associated with older age, lower education, and higher body mass index.

239,Fluorescent Glycan Fingerprinting of SARS2 Spike Proteins,"Glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification and has myriad biological functions. However, glycan analysis and research has always been a challenge. Here, we would like to present new techniques of glycan fingerprinting based on enzymatic fluorescent labeling and gel electrophoresis. The method is illustrated on SARS-2 spike (S) glycoproteins. SARS-2, a novel coronavirus and the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, has devastated the world since the end of 2019. To obtain the N-glycan fingerprint of a S protein, glycans released from the protein are first labeled through enzymatic incorporation of fluorophore-conjugated sialic acid or fucose, and then separated on acrylamide gel through electrophoresis, and finally visualized with a fluorescent imager. To identify the labeled glycans of a fingerprint, glycan standards and glycan ladders that are enzymatically generated are run alongside the samples as references. By comparing the mobility of a labeled glycan to that of a glycan standard, the identity of glycans maybe determined. Due to lack of enzyme for broad O-glycans releasing, O-glycans on the RBD protein are labeled with fluorescent sialic acid and digested with trypsin to obtain labeled glycan peptides that are then separated on gel. Glycan fingerprinting could serve as a quick way for global assessment of the glycosylation of a glycoprotein.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.426965,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.426965,2021-01-18,2021-01-18,,False
240,SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY: a multi-platform open-source bioinformatic pipeline for the automatic construction and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from NGS sequencing data,"BackgroundSince its first appearance in December 2019, the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread worldwide causing an increasing number of cases and deaths (35,537,491 and 1,042,798, respectively at the time of writing, https://covid19.who.int). Similarly, the number of complete viral genome sequences produced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), increased exponentially. NGS enables a rapid accumulation of a large number of sequences. However, bioinformatics analyses are critical and require combined approaches for data analysis, which can be challenging for non-bioinformaticians.

ResultsA user-friendly and sequencing platform-independent bioinformatics pipeline, named SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY (REconstruction of CoronaVirus gEnomes & Rapid analYsis) has been developed to build SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from raw sequencing reads and to investigate variants. The genomes built by SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY were compared with those obtained using other software available and revealed comparable or better performances of SARS-CoV2 RECoVERY. Depending on the number of reads, the complete genome reconstruction and variants analysis can be achieved in less than one hour. The pipeline was implemented in the multi-usage open-source Galaxy platform allowing an easy access to the software and providing computational and storage resources to the community.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY is a piece of software destined to the scientific community working on SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and molecular characterisation, providing a performant tool for the complete reconstruction and variants analysis of the viral genome. Additionally, the simple software interface and the ability to use it through a Galaxy instance without the need to implement computing and storage infrastructures, make SARS-CoV-2 RECoVERY a resource also for virologists with little or no bioinformatics skills.

241,SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces Krüppel-Like Factor 2 in human lung autopsy,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred in ~12% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a recent New York City cohort. Pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, characterized by increased expression of inflammatory genes and increased monolayer permeability, is a major component of ARDS. Vascular leak results in parenchymal accumulation of leukocytes, protein, and extravascular water, leading to pulmonary edema, ischemia, and activation of coagulation associated with COVID-19. Endothelial inflammation further contributes to uncontrolled cytokine storm in ARDS. We have recently demonstrated that Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a transcription factor which promotes endothelial quiescence and monolayer integrity, is significantly reduced in experimental models of ARDS. Lung inflammation and high-tidal volume ventilation result in reduced KLF2, leading to pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and acute lung injury. Mechanistically, we found that KLF2 is a potent transcriptional activator of Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (RAPGEF3) which orchestrates and maintains vascular integrity. Moreover, KLF2 regulates multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS)-implicated ARDS genes. Whether lung KLF2 is regulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here we report that endothelial KLF2 is significantly reduced in human lung autopsies from COVID-19 patients, which supports that ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 is a vascular phenotype possibly attributed to KLF2 down-regulation. We provide additional data demonstrating that KLF2 is down-regulated in SARS-CoV infection in mice.",Tzu-Han Lee; David Wu; Robert Guzy; Nathan Schoettler; Ayodeji Adegunsoye; Jeffrey Mueller; Aliya Hussein; Anne Sperling; Gokhan M Mutlu; Yun Fang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426691,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426691,2021-01-18,2021-01-18,,False

It proves fatal for one percent of those infected. Neurological symptoms, which range in severity, accompany a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases, indicating a potential vulnerability of neural cell types. To assess whether human cortical cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, we utilized primary human cortical tissue and stem cell-derived cortical organoids. We find significant and predominant infection in cortical astrocytes in both primary and organoid cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical populations. Infected astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity characteristics, growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, including astrocytes, have minimal ACE2 expression, we find high levels of alternative coronavirus receptors in infected astrocytes, including DPP4 and CD147. Inhibition of DPP4 reduced infection and decreased expression of the cell stress marker, ARCN1.

243,"From COVID-19 to the Common Cold: Novel Host-Targeted, Pan-Respiratory Antiviral Small Molecule Therapeutics","Antiviral compounds displaying remarkable features have been identified by an unconventional drug screen and advanced through animal validation. Efficacy is observed against the six viral families causing most human respiratory viral disease, irrespective of strain, including both influenza (FLUV) and SARS-CoV-2, with cell culture EC50 at or below 100 nM. Survival benefit is demonstrated in pigs against another member of family Coronaviridae, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and shown equally effective in mild and severe disease. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) titer is reduced by drug treatment in cotton rats. A substantial barrier to viral resistance is demonstrated for FLUV. Drug resin affinity chromatography (DRAC) reveals a novel drug target: a multi-protein complex (MPC) formed transiently, in an energy-dependent fashion, and composed of host proteins implicated in both viral lifecycles and manipulation of innate immunity. The protein composition of this host MPC is modified upon viral infection, with increase or decrease of some proteins and appearance or complete loss of others. Valosin-containing protein, also known as Transitional endoplasmatic reticulum ATPase (VCP/p97), is present in the target MPC of uninfected cells and significantly increased in both FLUV and CoV infection. SQSTM1/p62, a key regulator of the autophagy pathway of innate immunity whose dysfunction is implicated in cytokine storm, is i) found in the target MPC from uninfected cells, ii) diminished in DRAC eluates by infection, and iii) restored by drug treatment of infected cells. 14-3-3 is one of likely several proteins that comprise the drug-binding site. Advanced compounds with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and lung exposure are approaching criteria for a Target Product Profile. We propose these novel drug targets to comprise a previously unappreciated molecular basis for homeostasis that is modified by viruses to allow exploitation for viral propagation and is restored by treatment with the therapeutic compounds presented.

244,Large scale genomic and evolutionary study reveals SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates from Bangladesh strongly correlate with European origin and not with China.,"RationaleThe global public health is in serious crisis due to emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Studies are ongoing to reveal the genomic variants of the virus circulating in various parts of the world. However, data generated from low- and middle-income countries are scarce due to resource limitation. This study was focused to perform whole genome sequencing of 151 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive Bangladeshi patients. The goal of this study was to identify the genomic variants among the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates in Bangladesh, to determine the molecular epidemiology and to develop a relationship between host clinical trait with the virus genomic variants.

MethodSuspected patients were tested for COVID-19 using one step commercial qPCR kit for SARS-CoV-2 Virus. Viral RNA was extracted from positive patients, converted to cDNA which was amplified using Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel. Massive parallel sequencing was carried out using Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit Plus. Assembly of raw data is done by aligning the reads to a pre-defined reference genome (NC_045512.2) while retaining the unique variations of the input raw data by creating a consensus genome. A random forest-based association analysis was carried out to correlate the viral genomic variants with the clinical traits present in the host.

ResultAmong the 151 viral isolates, we observed the 413 unique variants. Among these 8 variants occurred in more than 80 % of cases which include 241C to T, 1163A to T, 3037C to T,14408C to T, 23403A to G, 28881G to A, 28882 G to A, and finally the 28883G to C. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a predominance of variants belonging to GR clade, which have a strong geographical presence in Europe, indicating possible introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into Bangladesh through a European channel. However, other possibilities like a route of entry from China cannot be ruled out as viral isolate belonging to L clade with a close relationship to Wuhan reference genome was also detected. We observed a total of 37 genomic variants to be strongly associated with clinical symptoms such as fever, sore throat, overall symptomatic status, etc. (Fishers Exact Test p-value<0.05). The most mention-worthy among those were the 3916CtoT (associated with causing sore throat, p-value 0.0005), the 14408C to T (associated with protection from developing cough, p-value= 0.027), and the 28881G to A, 28882G to A, and 28883G to C variant (associated with causing chest pain, p-value 0.025).

245,A national analysis of trends in COVID-19 infection and clinical management in Veterans Health Administration medical facilities,"OBJECTIVEWe explored longitudinal trends in sociodemographic characteristics, reported symptoms, laboratory findings, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, comorbidities, and 30-day in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODSThis retrospective cohort study included 43,267 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration between 03/01/20 and 08/31/20 and followed until 09/30/20. We focused our analysis on patients that were subsequently hospitalized, and categorized them into groups based on the month of hospitalization. We summarized our findings through descriptive statistics. We used a nonparametric rank-sum test for trend to examine any differences in the distribution of our study variables across the six months.

RESULTSDuring our study period, 8,240 patients were hospitalized, and 1,081 (13.1%) died within 30 days of admission. Hospitalizations increased over time, but the proportion of patients that died consistently declined from March (N=221/890, 24.8%) to August (N=111/1,396, 8.0%). Patients hospitalized in March compared to August were younger on average, mostly black, and symptomatic. They also had a higher frequency of baseline comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to present with abnormal laboratory findings including low lymphocyte counts and elevated creatinine. Lastly, receipt of mechanical ventilation and Hydroxychloroquine declined from March to August, while treatment with Dexamethasone and Remdesivir increased.

246,SARS-CoV-2 viral load distribution in different patient populations and age groups reveals that viral loads increase with age.,"ObjectiveTo describe the SARS-CoV-2 viral load distribution in different patient groups and age categories.

MethodsAll SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs (first PCR from unique patients only) that were collected between January 1 and December 1, 2020, predominantly in the Public Health Services regions Kennemerland and Hollands Noorden, province of North Holland, the Netherlands were included in this study. Swabs were derived from patients with respiratory symptoms who were presented at the general practitioner (GP), hospital, or hospital health care workers (HCWs) of four regional hospitals, nursing home residents and HCWs of multiple nursing homes, and in majority (>75%) from Public Health testing facilities of the two Public Health Services. SARS-CoV-2 PCR crossing point (Cp) values were used to estimate viral loads (higher Cp-values indicate lower viral loads).

ResultsIn total, 278.455 unique patients were tested of whom 9{middle dot}1% (n=25.374) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. As there were differences in viral load distribution between tested populations, further analyses focused on PCRs performed by public health services (n=211.914) where sampling and inclusion were uniform. These data reveal a clear relation between age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with especially children aged<12 years showing lower viral loads than shown in adults ({beta}: -0{middle dot}03, 95CI% -0{middle dot}03 to -0{middle dot}02, p<0{middle dot}001), independent of sex and/or symptom duration. Interestingly, the median Cp-values between the oldest (>79 years) and youngest (<12 years) population differed by over 4 PCR cycles, suggesting approximately a 16-fold difference in viral load. In addition, the proportion of children aged <12 years with a low load (Cp-value >30) was significantly higher compared to the other patients (31{middle dot}1% vs. 17{middle dot}2%, p-value<0.001).

ConclusionWe observed that in patients tested by Public Health Services, SARS-CoV2 viral load increases significantly with age. Previous studies suggest that young children (<12 years) play a limited role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Currently, the relation between viral load and infectivity is not yet well understood, and further studies should elucidate whether the lower viral load in children is indeed related to their suggested limited role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, as rapid antigen tests are less sensitive than PCR, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests could have lower sensitivity in children than in adults.",Sjoerd Euser; Sem Aronson; Irene Manders; Steven van Lelyveld; Bjorn Herpers; Jan Sinnige; Jayant Kalpoe; Claudia van Gemeren; Dominic Snijders; Ruud Jansen; Sophie Schuurmans Stekhoven; Marlies van Houten; Ivar Lede; James Cohen Stuart; Fred Slijkerman Megelink; Erik Kapteijns; Jeroen den Boer; Elisabeth Sanders; Alex Wagemakers; Dennis Souverein,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249691,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249691,2021-01-17,2021-01-17,,True
247,Insights from a Pan India Sero-Epidemiological survey (Phenome-India Cohort) for SARS-CoV2,"BackgroundIndia has been amongst the most affected nations during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, with sparse data on country-wide spread of asymptomatic infections and antibody persistence. This longitudinal cohort study was aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV2 sero-positivity rate as a marker of infection and evaluate temporal persistence of antibodies with neutralization capability and to infer possible risk factors for infection.

MethodsCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India (CSIR) with its more than 40 laboratories and centers in urban and semi-urban settings spread across the country piloted the pan country surveillance. 10427 adult individuals working in CSIR laboratories and their family members based on voluntary participation were assessed for antibody presence and stability was analyzed over 6 months utilizing qualitative Elecsys SARS CoV2 specific antibody kit and GENScript cPass SARS-CoV2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit. Along with demographic information, possible risk factors were evaluated through self to be filled online forms with data acquired on blood group type, occupation type, addiction and habits including smoking and alcohol, diet preferences, medical history and transport type utilized. Symptom history and information on possible contact and compliance with COVID 19 universal precautions was also obtained.

Findings1058 individuals (10{middle dot}14%) had antibodies against SARS-CoV2. A follow-up on 346 sero-positive individuals after three months revealed stable to higher antibody levels against SARS-CoV2 but declining plasma activity for neutralizing SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain and ACE2 interaction. A repeat sampling of 35 individuals, at six months, revealed declining antibody levels while the neutralizing activity remained stable compared to three months. Majority of sero-positive individuals (75%) did not recall even one of nine symptoms since March 2020. Fever was the most common symptom with one-fourth reporting loss of taste or smell. Significantly associated risks for sero-positivity (Odds Ratio, 95% CI, p value) were observed with usage of public transport (1{middle dot}79, 1{middle dot}43 - 2{middle dot}24, 2{middle dot}81561E-06), occupational responsibilities such as security, housekeeping personnel etc. (2{middle dot}23, 1{middle dot}92 - 2{middle dot}59, 6{middle dot}43969E-26), non-smokers (1{middle dot}52, 1{middle dot}16 - 1{middle dot}99, 0{middle dot}02) and non-vegetarianism (1{middle dot}67, 1{middle dot}41 - 1{middle dot}99, 3{middle dot}03821E-08). An iterative regression analysis was confirmatory and led to only modest changes to estimates. Predilections for sero-positivity was noted with specific ABO blood groups -O was associated with a lower risk.

InterpretationIn a first-of-its-kind study from India, we report the sero-positivity in a country-wide cohort and identify variable susceptible associations for contacting infection. Serology and Neutralizing Antibody response provides much-sought-for general insights on the immune response to the virus among Indians and will be an important resource for designing vaccination strategies.

248,A Serology Strategy for Epidemiological Studies Based on the Comparison of the Performance of Seven Different Test Systems - The Representative COVID-19 Cohort Munich,"BackgroundSerosurveys are essential to understand SARS-CoV-2 exposure and enable population-level surveillance, but currently available tests need further in-depth evaluation. We aimed to identify testing-strategies by comparing seven seroassays in a population-based cohort.

MethodsWe analysed 6,658 samples consisting of true-positives (n=193), true-negatives (n=1,091), and specimens of unknown status (n=5,374). For primary testing, we used Euroimmun-Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA-IgA/IgG and Roche-Elecsys-Anti-SARS-CoV-2; and virus-neutralisation, GeneScript(R)cPass, VIRAMED-SARS-CoV-2-ViraChip(R), and Mikrogen-recomLine-SARS-CoV-2-IgG, including common-cold CoVs, for confirmatory testing. Statistical modelling generated optimised assay cut-off-thresholds.

FindingsSensitivity of Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgA was 64.8%, specificity 93.3%; for Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgG, sensitivity was 77.2/79.8% (manufacturers/optimised cut-offs), specificity 98.0/97.8%; Roche-anti-N sensitivity was 85.5/88.6%, specificity 99.8/99.7%. In true-positives, mean and median titres remained stable for at least 90-120 days after RT-PCR-positivity. Of true-positives with positive RT-PCR (<30 days), 6.7% did not mount detectable seroresponses. Virus-neutralisation was 73.8% sensitive, 100.0% specific (1:10 dilution). Neutralisation surrogate tests (GeneScript(R)cPass, Mikrogen-recomLine-RBD) were >94.9% sensitive, >98.1% specific. Seasonality had limited effects; cross-reactivity with common-cold CoVs 229E and NL63 in SARS-CoV-2 true-positives was significant.

ConclusionOptimised cut-offs improved test performances of several tests. Non-reactive serology in true-positives was uncommon. For epidemiological purposes, confirmatory testing with virus-neutralisation may be replaced with GeneScript(R)cPass or recomLine-RBD. Head-to-head comparisons given here aim to contribute to the refinement of testing-strategies for individual and public health use.",Laura Olbrich; Noemi Castelletti; Yannik Schaelte; Merce Gari; Peter Puetz; Abhishek Bakuli; Michael Pritsch; Inge Kroidl; Elmar Saathoff; Jessica Michelle Guggenbuehl Noller; Volker Fingerle; Ronan Le Gleut; Leonard Gilberg; Isabel Brand; Philine Falk; Alisa Markgraf; Flora Deak; Friedrich Riess; Max Diefenbach; Tabea M Eser; Franz Weinauer; Silke Martin; Ernst-Markus Quenzel; Marc Becker; Juergen Durner; Philipp Girl; Katharina Mueller; Katja Radon; Christiane Fuchs; Roman Woelfel; Jan Hasenauer; Michael Hoelscher; Andreas Wieser,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249735,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249735,2021-01-16,2021-01-16,,True
249,Metabolic markers distinguish COVID-19 from other intensive care patients and show potential to stratify for disease risk,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection affecting multiple organ systems of great significance for metabolic processes. Thus. there is increasing interest in metabolic and lipoprotein signatures of the disease and early analyses have demonstrated metabolic pattern typical for atherosclerotic and hepatic damage in COVID-19 patients. However, it remains unclear whether these are specific for COVID-19 or a general marker of critical illness. To answer this question, we have analyzed 276 serum samples from 92 individuals using NMR metabolomics, including longitudinally collected samples from 5 COVID-19 and 11 cardiogenic shock intensive care patients, 18 SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals, and 58 healthy controls.

COVID-19 patients showed a distinct metabolic serum profile, including changes typical for severe dyslipidemia and a deeply altered metabolic status compared to healthy controls. Specifically, VLDL parameters, IDL particles, large-sized LDL particles, and the ApoB100/ApoA1 ratio were significantly increased, whereas HDL fractions were decreased. Moreover, a similarly perturbed profile was apparent, even when compared to other ICU patients suffering from cardiogenic shock, highlighting the impact of COVID-19 especially on lipid metabolism and energy status. COVID-19 patients were separated with an AUROC of 1.0 when compared to both healthy controls and cardiogenic shock patients. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals without acute COVID-19 did not show a significantly perturbed metabolic profile compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, but SARS-CoV-2 antibody-titers correlated significantly with metabolic parameters, including levels of glycine, ApoA2, and small-sized LDL and HDL subfractions. Our data suggest that NMR metabolic profiles are suitable for COVID-19 patient stratification and post-treatment monitoring.",Franziska Schmelter; Bandik Foeh; Alvaro Mallagray; Johann Rahmoeller; Marc Ehlers; Selina Lehrian; Vera von Kopylow; Inga Kuensting; Anne Sophie Lixenfeld; Emily Martin; Mohab Ragab; Max Borsche; Alexander Balck; Eva Juliane Vollstedt; Roza Meyer-Saraei; Fabian Kreutzmann; Ingo Eitel Eitel; Stefan Taube Taube; Christine Klein Klein; Alexander Katalinic Katalinic; Jan Rupp Rupp; Eckard Jantzen Jantzen; Tobias Graf; Christian Sina; Ulrich L Guenther,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249645,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249645,2021-01-16,2021-01-16,,True

To gauge the effectiveness of these measures at the University of Pennsylvania, we conducted a longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity and seroconversion in patients presenting to infusion centers for cancer-directed therapy between 5/21/2020 and 10/8/2020. Participants completed questionnaires and had up to five serial blood collections. Of 124 enrolled patients, only two (1.6%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on initial blood draw, and no initially seronegative patients developed newly detectable antibodies on subsequent blood draw(s), corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 0% (95%CI 0.0-4.1%) over 14.8 person-years of follow up, with a median of 13 healthcare visits per patient.

251,Reduction in transfer of micro-organisms between patients and staff using short-sleeved gowns and hand/arm hygiene in Intensive Care during the Covid pandemic: a simulation-based randomised trial.,"BackgroundCurrent PPE practices in UK intensive care units involve ""sessional"" gown use. This protects staff, but puts patients at risk of nosocomial infection via PPE gowns. Anecdotal reports of such infections in ITUs during Covid are frequent. We therefore explored the use of short-sleeved gowns with hand and arm hygiene as an alternative to sessional gowns.

MethodsITU Staff were invited for simulation suite training in Covid intubation and proning. They were trained in a specific hand and arm washing technique before performing simulated tasks using both standard and modified (short sleeved) PPE. Fluorescent powder was used to simulate micro-organisms, and detected using standardised photos under U/V light. Teams of staff were randomised to use standard or modified PPE first. Individuals were questioned about their feeling of personal safety, comfort and the patients safety at 4 intervals.

Results68 staff and 17 proning volunteers were studied in 17 sessions. Modified PPE completely prevented staff contamination during Covid intubation, which occurred in 30/67 staff wearing standard PPE (p = 0.0029, McNemar). Conversely, proning volunteers were contaminated by staff in 15/17 sessions with standard PPE and in 1/17 with modified PPE (P = 0.0227 McNemar). Impressions of staff comfort were superior with modified PPE (p< 0.001, t-test); personal safety scored higher with standard PPE, but the difference decreased during the session (p<0.001 start, 0.068 end). Impressions of patient safety were initially similar (p=0.87) but finished strongly in favour of modified PPE (p<0.001).

ConclusionsModified PPE using short sleeves and hand/arm cleansing appears superior to standard PPE with sessional gowns in preventing transfer of contamination between staff and patients.

252,Modeling the impact of racial and ethnic disparities on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics,"The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk changes across racial and ethnic groups. A proportionate mixing model reduced the overall HIT, but more realistic levels of assortative mixing increased the threshold. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in an assortative mixing model fit to Long Island census data, 80% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT is reached compared to 33% of non-Hispanic whites. Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in a dis-proportionate distribution of the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Kevin C Ma; Tigist Menkir; Stephen Kissler; Yonatan Grad; Marc Lipsitch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249881,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249881,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
253,Development of at-home sample collection logistics for large scale SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies,"In the midst of a pandemic, serologic studies are a valuable tool to understand the course of the outbreak and guide public health and general pandemic management. However, given significant safety constraints including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, sample collection becomes more difficult given traditional phlebotomy protocols. For such studies, a representative sample of the underlying population is paramount to elicit meaningful insights that capture the spread of the infection, particularly when different sub-populations face varying disease burden. We aimed to address these challenges by conducting a fully remote study to investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Massachusetts. Leveraging electronic study engagement and at-home self-collection of finger-prick samples, we enrolled 2,066 participants representative of the ethnic and racial composition of Massachusetts. SARS-CoV-2 total IgG seropositivity was 3.15%, and follow-up measurements at days 7, 15, 45, and 90 indicate a generally durable antibody response. A higher risk of infection was observed for healthcare workers and their cohabitants and those with comorbidities, as well as lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in the age groups of 18-29 and 50-59-years-old. High engagement and positive feedback from the participants and quality of self-collected specimens point to the usefulness of this design for future population-level serological studies that more effectively and safely reach a broad representative cohort, thus yielding more comprehensive insights into the burden of infection and disease in populations.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWe aimed to implement a fully remote seroprevalence study for SARS-CoV-2, leveraging electronic methods and at-home self-collection of specimens to engage a representative study population.

254,Importance of patient bed pathways and length of stay differences in predicting COVID-19 bed occupancy in England,"ObjectivesPredicting bed occupancy for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requires understanding of length of stay (LoS) in particular bed types. LoS can vary depending on the patients ""bed pathway"" - the sequence of transfers between bed types during a hospital stay. In this study, we characterise these pathways, and their impact on predicted hospital bed occupancy.

DesignWe obtained data from University College Hospital (UCH) and the ISARIC4C COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who required care in general ward or critical care (CC) beds to determine possible bed pathways and LoS. We developed a discrete-time model to examine the implications of using either bed pathways or only average LoS by bed type to forecast bed occupancy. We compared model-predicted bed occupancy to publicly available bed occupancy data on COVID-19 in England between March and August 2020.

ResultsIn both the UCH and CO-CIN datasets, 82% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 only received care in general ward beds. We identified four other bed pathways, present in both datasets: ""Ward, CC, Ward"", ""Ward, CC"", ""CC"" and ""CC, Ward"". Mean LoS varied by bed type, pathway, and dataset, between 1.78 and 13.53 days.

For UCH, we found that using bed pathways improved the accuracy of bed occupancy predictions, while only using an average LoS for each bed type underestimated true bed occupancy. However, using the CO-CIN LoS dataset we were not able to replicate past data on bed occupancy in England, suggesting regional LoS heterogeneities.

ConclusionsWe identified five bed pathways, with substantial variation in LoS by bed type, pathway, and geography. This might be caused by local differences in patient characteristics, clinical care strategies, or resource availability, and suggests that national LoS averages may not be appropriate for local forecasts of bed occupancy for COVID-19.",Quentin J Leclerc; Naomi M Fuller; Ruth H Keogh; Karla Diaz-Ordaz; Richard Sekula; Malcolm G Semple; - ISARIC4C Investigators; - CMMID COVID-19 Working Group; Katherine E Atkins; Simon R Procter; Gwenan M Knight,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249791,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249791,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
255,"Do antibody positive healthcare workers have lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates than antibody negative healthcare workers? Large multi-centre prospective cohort study (the SIREN study), England: June to November 2020","BackgroundThere is an urgent need to better understand whether individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 are protected from future SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsA large multi-centre prospective cohort was recruited from publicly funded hospital staff in the UK. Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed fortnightly questionnaires on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive or prior PCR/antibody test positive) or negative cohort (antibody negative, not previously known to be PCR/antibody positive). Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, possible (subdivided by symptom-status)) depending on hierarchy of evidence. Individuals in the primary infection were excluded from this analysis if infection was confirmed by antibody only. Reinfection rates in the positive cohort were compared against new PCR positives in the negative cohort using a mixed effective multivariable logistic regression analysis.

FindingsBetween 18 June and 09 November 2020, 44 reinfections (2 probable, 42 possible) were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 6,614 participants, collectively contributing 1,339,078 days of follow-up. This compares with 318 new PCR positive infections and 94 antibody seroconversions in the negative cohort of 14,173 participants, contributing 1,868,646 days of follow-up. The incidence density per 100,000 person days between June and November 2020 was 3.3 reinfections in the positive cohort, compared with 22.4 new PCR confirmed infections in the negative cohort. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.17 for all reinfections (95% CI 0.13-0.24) compared to PCR confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was over 160 days.

InterpretationA prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 83% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed five months following primary infection. This is the minimum likely effect as seroconversions were not included.

256,Direct Simulation of the CoVid-19 epidemic,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe introduce an agent-based model to simulate the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19. Most computational models proposed to study this epidemic do no take into account human mobility. We present a direct simulation model where mobility plays a key role and propose as well four quarantine strategies. The results show that the no-quarantine strategy does lead to a high peak of contagions with no rebound. Quarantined strategies, for their part, show a re-emergence of the epidemic with smaller and softer peaks.",Augusto Cabrera-Becerril; Raul Peralta; Pedro Miramontes,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249829,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249829,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

258,"Modelling the Spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 in Presence of the Lockdown and Quarantine Measures by a ""Kinetic-Type Reactions"" Approach","We propose a realistic model for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures, which takes into account the time-delay for recovery or death processes. The dynamic equations for the entire process are derived by adopting a kinetic-type reactions approach. More specifically, the lockdown and the quarantine measures are modelled by some kind of inhibitor reactions where susceptible and infected individuals can be trapped into inactive states. The dynamics for the recovered people is obtained by accounting people who are only traced back to hospitalised infected people. To get the evolution equation we take inspiration from the Michaelis-Mentens enzyme-substrate reaction model (the so-called MM reaction) where the enzyme is associated to the available hospital beds, the substrate to the infected people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively. In other words, everything happens as if the hospitals beds act as a catalyzer in the hospital recovery process. Of course, in our case the reverse MM reactions has no sense in our case and, consequently, the kinetic constant is equal to zero. Finally, the O.D.E.s for people tested positive to COVID-19 is simply modelled by the following kinetic scheme S + I {Rightarrow} 2I with I {Rightarrow} R or I {Rightarrow} D, with S, I, R, and D denoting the compartments Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased people, respectively. The resulting kinetic-type equations provide the O.D.E.s, for elementary reaction steps, describing the number of the infected people, the total number of the recovered people previously hospitalised, subject to the lockdown and the quarantine measure, and the total number of deaths. The model foresees also the second wave of Infection by Coronavirus. The tests carried out on real data for Belgium, France and Germany confirmed the correctness of our model.",Giorgio SONNINO; Philippe PEETERS; Pasquale NARDONE,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249797,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249797,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
259,Optimal piecewise constant vaccination and lockdown policies for COVID-19,"We formulate a controlled system of ordinary differential equations, with vaccination and lockdown interventions as controls, to simulate the mitigation of COVID-19. The performance of the controls is measured through a cost functional involving vaccination and lockdown costs as well as the burden of COVID19 quantified in DALYs. We calibrate parameters with data from Mexico City and Valle de Mexico. By using differential evolution, we minimize the cost functional subject to the controlled system and find optimal policies that are constant in time intervals of a given size. The main advantage of these policies relies on its practical implementation since the health authority has to make only a finite number of different decisions. Our methodology to find optimal policies is relatively general, allowing changes in the dynamics, the cost functional, or the frequency the policymaker changes actions.",Gabriel Adrian Salcedo-Varea; Francisco Penunuri; David Gonzalez-Sanchez; Saul Diaz-Infante,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249773,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249773,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
260,Optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation using real-time seroprevalence estimates in Rhode Island and Massachusetts,"As three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines come to market in Europe and North America in the winter of 2020-2021, distribution networks will be in a race against a major epidemiological wave of SARS-CoV-2 that began in autumn 2020. Rapid and optimized vaccine allocation is critical during this time. With 95% efficacy reported for two of the vaccines, near-term public health needs require that distribution is prioritized to the elderly, health-care workers, teachers, essential workers, and individuals with co-morbidities putting them at risk of severe clinical progression. Here, we evaluate various age-based vaccine distributions using a validated mathematical model based on current epidemic trends in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. We allow for varying waning efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity, as this has not yet been measured. We account for the fact that known COVID-positive cases may not be included in the first round of vaccination. And, we account for current age-specific immune patterns in both states. We find that allocating a substantial proportion (> 75%) of vaccine supply to individuals over the age of 70 is optimal in terms of reducing total cumulative deaths through mid-2021. As we do not explicitly model other high mortality groups, this result on vaccine allocation applies to all groups at high risk of mortality if infected. Our analysis confirms that for an easily transmissible respiratory virus, allocating a large majority of vaccinations to groups with the highest mortality risk is optimal. Our analysis assumes that health systems during winter 2020-2021 have equal staffing and capacity to previous phases of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic; we do not consider the effects of understaffed hospitals or unvaccinated medical staff. Vaccinating only seronegative individuals avoids redundancy in vaccine use on individuals that may already be immune, and will result in 1% to 2% reductions in cumulative hospitalizations and deaths by mid-2021. Assuming high vaccination coverage (> 28%) and no major relaxations in distancing, masking, gathering size, or hygiene guidelines between now and spring 2021, our model predicts that a combination of vaccination and population immunity will lead to low or near-zero transmission levels by the second quarter of 2021.",Thu Nguyen-Anh Tran; Nathan Wikle; Joseph Albert; Haider Inam; Emily R Strong; Karel Brinda; Scott M Leighow; Fuhan Yang; Sajid Hossain; Justin R Pritchard; Philip Chan; William P Hanage; Ephraim M Hanks; Maciej F Boni,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249694,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249694,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
261,"Socioeconomic status determines COVID-19 incidence and related mortality in Santiago, Chile","The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted dense urban populations particularly hard. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality patterns, and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. We find that among all age groups, there is a strong association between socioeconomic status and both mortality -measured either by direct COVID-19 attributed deaths or excess deaths- and public health capacity. Specifically, we show that behavioral factors like human mobility, as well as health system factors such as testing volumes, testing delays, and test positivity rates are associated with disease outcomes. These robust patterns suggest multiple possibly interacting pathways that can explain the observed disease burden and mortality differentials: (i) in lower socioeconomic status municipalities, human mobility was not reduced as much as in more affluent municipalities; (ii) testing volumes in these locations were insufficient early in the pandemic and public health interventions were applied too late to be effective; (iii) test positivity and testing delays were much higher in less affluent municipalities, indicating an impaired capacity of the health-care system to contain the spread of the epidemic; and (iv) infection fatality rates appear much higher in the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. Together, these findings highlight the exacerbated consequences of health-care inequalities in a large city of the developing world, and provide practical methodological approaches useful for characterizing COVID-19 burden and mortality in other segregated urban centers.",Gonzalo E Mena; Pamela P Martinez; Ayesha Mahmud; Pablo Marquet; Caroline Buckee; Mauricio Santillana,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249682,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249682,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
262,Predicting Emerging Themes in Rapidly Expanding COVID-19 Literature with Dynamic Word Embedding Networks and Machine Learning,"BackgroundCOVID-19 knowledge has been changing rapidly with the fast pace of information that accompanied the pandemic. Since peer-reviewed research is a trusted source of evidence, capturing and predicting the emerging themes in COVID-19 literature are crucial for guiding research and policy. Machine learning, natural language processing and dynamical networks have the potential to enable rapid distillation and prediction of actionable insights for ending the pandemic.

ObjectiveWe hypothesized that emerging COVID-19 research trends can be captured and predicted from networks constructed upon language features. Further, we aimed to detect communities in these networks and used centrality measures to track and predict emerging network modules as dominant themes in a given time period. The goal of our study was to make our findings publicly available as an explainable AI dashboard for researchers and policymakers.

MethodsAbstracts from more than 95,000 peer-reviewed articles from the WHO curated COVID-19 database were used to construct word embedding models. Named entity recognition was used to refine the terms. Cosine similarity between the terms was then used to construct dynamical networks in order to understand the temporal trend of emerging associations over months and visualized as alluvial diagrams. Finally, temporal link prediction between diseases for the subsequent month based on their trends of occurrence in the previous six months was carried out to predict the emergence and disappearance of associations in the rapidly changing pandemic scenario.

ResultsCommunity detection upon dynamical networks clearly demonstrated the emergence of thromboembolic complications as a cluster and dominant theme between March and August, 2020. Forecasting of top-K influential entities further allowed prediction of future trends, such as the emergence of psychiatry theme as a central node by February 2021. XGBoost modeling in our proposed temporal link prediction framework achieved an AUC-ROC score of 0.855 for predicting new dis(associations) one month in advance. Visualization of the underlying word-embedding models allowed interactive querying to choose novel keywords and extractive models summarized the research relevant to the keyword, allowing faster knowledge distillation.

ConclusionWe provide an explainable AI approach for querying, tracking and predicting novel insights in COVID-19 peer reviewed literature. The EvidenceFlow web-application is publicly available and emerging trends are updated on a monthly basis.

264,Implementing Essential Coaching for Every Mother during COVID-19: A Pilot Pre-Post Intervention Study,"ObjectivesThe primary objective was to evaluate the preliminary impact of Essential Coaching for Every Mother on self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety and postpartum depression. The second objective was to explore the acceptability of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA prospective pre-post study was conducted with first time mothers in Nova Scotia, Canada between July 15th and September 19th, 2020. Participants completed a self-report survey at enrolment (after birth) and six-weeks postpartum. Variety of standardized measures were used and qualitative feedback on the program was also collected. Paired t-tests were carried out to determine changes from baseline to follow-up on psychosocial outcomes and qualitative feedback was analysed through thematic analysis.

ResultsA total of 88 women enrolled. Self-efficacy increased between baseline (B) and follow-up (F) (B:33.33; F:37.11, p=0.000) while anxiety (STAI) declined (B:38.49; F:34.79; p=0.004). No other significant changes were found. In terms of acceptability, 89% of participants felt that the number of messages were just right, 84.5% felt the messages contained all the information they needed relative to caring for a newborn and 98.8% indicated they would recommend this program to other new mothers.

ConclusionEssential Coaching for Every Mother may play a role increasing maternal self-efficacy and decreasing anxiety, although future work with a control group is important to delineate the true effects of the program.

265,Sterilization of disposable face masks with respect to COVID-19 shortages; a nationwide field study including 19 sterilisation departments,"ObjectiveFace masks also referred to as half masks are essential to protect healthcare professionals, working in close contact with patients having Covid-19 related symptoms. During the threating deficit, healthcare institutions sought an approach to re-use face masks or to acquire imported masks. The objective of this study is to assess the quality of sterilised and imported FFP2/KN95 face mask materials.

Designprospective, bench-to-bedside

SettingGeneral healthcare including 19 hospitals in the Netherlands

InterventionsFace masks were reprocessed using a medical autoclave at 121{degrees}C.

MethodsA 48 minutes steam sterilization process of single-use face masks with 15 min holding time at a 121 {degrees}C was developed, validated and implemented in 19 different hospitals. Steam and H2O2 plasma sterilized as well as new, imported masks are tested in a custom-made, non-standard EN-149, test set-up that measures Particle Filtration Efficiency (PFE) and pressure drops.

ResultsPFE validation data of 84 masks indicated differences of 2.3{+/-}2 % (mean{+/-}SD) between the custom build test set-up and a continues flow according to the EN-149. Test data showed the mean PFE values of 444 sterilised FFP2 face masks from 19 CSSD were 90{+/-}11% (mean{+/-}SD) and of 474 imported KN95/FFP2 face masks 83{+/-}16% (mean{+/-}SD). Differences in PFE between sterilisation departments were found.

ConclusionFace masks can be reprocessed with 121 0 C steam or H2O2 plasma sterilization with minimum reduction of PFE. PFE comparison between sterilised mask and new, imported mask filter material indicates that most reprocessed masks of high quality brands outperform new imported face masks of unknown brands. Although the PFE of tested face mask material from different sterilisation departments remained efficient, different types of sterilisation equipment can result in different PFE outcomes.

Strengths and limitations of this study- Reprocessing face masks at 121 {degrees}C steam Sterilization, a simple method to be used by hospitals in times of shortages
- Laboratory findings to evaluate the safety and quality of face mask material
- The study is limited and restricted to selected FFP-2 face masks

266,SARS-CoV-2 infection control implementation based on sources of infection showing directions for three age groups in Japan,"BackgroundSome aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission in children and adults remain unclear. This report describes different SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns by age group in Japan.

Methods and findingsThis retrospective observational case series study analyzed transmission patterns of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections found by local health authorities and commercial laboratories during January 14 through July 31, 2020 in Japan. After ascertaining the infection source for every symptomatic case as clusters at households, daycare facilities, schools, hospitals and workplaces etc., their associated transmission patterns were analyzed. Identified cases were divided into three groups: underage, < 20; adults, 20-59; and elderly people 60 years old and older. The reproductive number (R)s of respective transmission directions found for the respective age groups were compared.

Of 26,986 total cases, 23,746 unknown cases were found, leaving 3,240 ascertained sources of infection (12.0%) comprising 125 (3.9%) underage, 2350 (72.5%) adult, and 765 (23.6%) elderly people. The respective Rs of underage infection sources directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0415 (95% CI, 0.0138-0.0691), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.9171-1.3226), and 0.2811 (95% CI, 0.2074-0.3687). The respective Rs of adult infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0140 (95% CI, 0.0120-0.0162), 0.5392 (95% CI, 0.5236-0.5550), and 0.1135 (95% CI, 0.1074-0.1197). The respective Rs of elderly infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated as 0.065 (95% CI, 0.0039-0.0091), 0.3264 (95% CI, 0.3059-0.3474), and 0.3991 (95% CI, 0.3757-0.4229).

ConclusionsThe main sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection were adults and elderly people. The R of underage people directed to adults was greater than 1 because of close familial contact but they were unlikely to become carriers transmitting SARS-CoV-2 because they accounted for a minority for transmissions. Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among adults and elderly people, suggesting that infection control of SARS-CoV-2 should be managed specifically by generation.",Atsuko Hata; Junko Kurita; Eri Muso; Toshiro Katayama; Takahide Hata; Yasushi Ohkusa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249637,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249637,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
267,How to best test suspected cases of COVID-19: an analysis of the diagnostic performance of RT-PCR and alternative molecular methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,"As COVID-19 testing is rolled out increasingly widely, the use of a range of alternative testing methods will be beneficial in ensuring testing systems are resilient and adaptable to different clinical and public health scenarios. Here, we compare and discuss the diagnostic performance of a range of different molecular assays designed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with suspected COVID-19. Using findings from a systematic review of 103 studies, we categorised COVID-19 molecular assays into 12 different test classes, covering point-of-care tests, various alternative RT-PCR protocols, and alternative methods such as isothermal amplification. We carried out meta-analyses to estimate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of each test class. We also estimated the positive and negative predictive values of all diagnostic test classes across a range of prevalence rates. Using previously validated RT-PCR assays as a reference standard, 11 out of 12 classes showed a summary sensitivity estimate of at least 92% and a specificity estimate of at least 99%. Several diagnostic test classes were estimated to have positive predictive values of 100% throughout the investigated prevalence spectrum, whilst estimated negative predictive values were more variable and sensitive to disease prevalence. We also report the results of clinical utility models that can be used to determine the information gained from a positive and negative test result in each class, and whether each test is more suitable for confirmation or exclusion of disease. Our analysis suggests that several tests exist that are suitable alternatives to standard RT-PCR and we discuss scenarios in which these could be most beneficial, such as where time to test result is critical or, where resources are constrained. However, we also highlight methodological concerns with the design and conduct of many included studies, and also the existence of likely publication bias for some test classes. Our results should be interpreted with these shortcomings in mind. Furthermore, our conclusions on test performance are limited to their use in symptomatic populations: we did not identify sufficient suitable data to allow analysis of testing in asymptomatic populations.",Adrian Mironas; David Jarrom; Evan Campbell; Jennifer Washington; Sabine Ettinger; Ingrid Wilbacher; Gottfried Endel; Hrvoje Vrazic; Susan Myles; Matthew Prettyjohns,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249863,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249863,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
268,Antibiotic Prescribing Patterns at COVID-19 Dedicated Wards in Bangladesh: A Single Center Point-Prevalence Survey,"There is a clear deficiency in antimicrobial usage data and ongoing stewardship programs both in government and private health care facilities in Bangladesh. As evidences are mounting regarding irrational and often unnecessary use of antibiotics during COVID-19 pandemic, a point prevalence survey (PPS) was conducted across COVID-19 dedicated wards in Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). Antibiotic usage data were collected from 193 patients at different COVID-19 dedicated wards at DMCH between 21 May, 2020 and 10 June, 2020. Comparisons in antibiotic usage were made between different groups using Pearson chi-square and Fisher exact test. Factors associated with multiple antibiotic prescription were evaluated using binary logistic regression model.

On survey date all (100%) patients were receiving at least one antibiotic with 133 patients (68.91%) receiving multiple antibiotics. Overall, patients presenting with severe disease received more antibiotics on average. Third generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone (53.8%), meropenem (40.9%), moxifloxacin (29.5%) and doxycycline (25.4%) were the four most prescribed antibiotics among survey patients. Among comorbidities diabetes mellitus (DM) was independently associated with increased antibiotic prescribing. Abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum d-dimer were linked with higher odds of antibiotic prescribing among survey patients. Overall, prevalence of antibiotic prescribing in COVID-19 patients at DMCH was very high. This could be attributed to a lack of clear treatment protocol against COVID-19 till date as well as lack of modern laboratory facilities to support judicial antibiotic prescribing in Bangladesh.

270,"Anticipating the curve: can online symptom-based data reflect COVID-19 case activity in Ontario, Canada?","BackgroundLimitations in laboratory diagnostic capacity and reporting delays have hampered efforts to mitigate and control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic globally. Syndromic surveillance of COVID-19 is an important public health tool that can help detect outbreaks, mobilize a rapid response, and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether syndromic surveillance through self-reported COVID-19 symptoms could be a timely proxy for laboratory-confirmed case trends in the Canadian province of Ontario.

MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed self-reported symptoms data collected using an online tool - Outbreaks Near Me (ONM) - from April 20th to Oct 11th, 2020 in Ontario, Canada. We estimated the correlation coefficient between the weekly proportion of respondents reporting a COVID-like illness (CLI) to both the weekly number of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and the percent positivity in the same period for the same week and with a one-week lag.

ResultsThere were 314,686 responses from 188,783 unique respondents to the ONM symptom survey. Respondents were more likely to be female and be in the 40-59 age demographic compared to the Ontario general population. There was a strong positive correlation between the weekly number of reported cases in Ontario and the percent of respondents reporting CLI each week (r = 0.89, p <0.01) and with a one-week lag (r = 0.89, p <0.01).

InterpretationWe demonstrate a strong positive and significant correlation (r = 0.89, p <0.01) between percent of self-reported COVID-like illness and the subsequent weeks COVID-19 cases reported, highlighting that a rise in CLI may precede official statistics by at least 1 week.

271,A Vital Sign-based Prediction Algorithm for Differentiating COVID-19 Versus Seasonal Influenza in Hospitalized Patients,"Patients with influenza and SARS-CoV2/Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections have different clinical course and outcomes. We developed and validated a supervised machine learning pipeline to distinguish the two viral infections using the available vital signs and demographic dataset from the first hospital/emergency room encounters of 3,883 patients who had confirmed diagnoses of influenza A/B, COVID-19 or negative laboratory test results. The models were able to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of at least 97% using our multiclass classifier. The predictive models were externally validated on 15,697 encounters in 3,125 patients available on TrinetX database that contains patient-level data from different healthcare organizations. The influenza vs. COVID-19-positive model had an AUC of 98%, and 92% on the internal and external test sets, respectively. Our study illustrates the potentials of machine-learning models for accurately distinguishing the two viral infections. The code is made available at https://github.com/ynaveena/COVID-19-vs-Influenza and may be have utility as a frontline diagnostic tool to aid healthcare workers in triaging patients once the two viral infections start cocirculating in the communities.",Naveena Yanamala; Nanda H.

272,Innate lymphoid cells and disease tolerance in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BACKGROUNDRisk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases with age, is greater in males, and is associated with decreased numbers of blood lymphoid cells. Though the reasons for these robust associations are unclear, effects of age and sex on innate and adaptive lymphoid subsets, including on homeostatic innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) implicated in disease tolerance, may underlie the effects of age and sex on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

METHODSFlow cytometry was used to quantitate subsets of blood lymphoid cells from people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), comparing those hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (n=40) and those treated as outpatients for less severe disease (n=51). 86 healthy individuals served as controls. The relationship between abundance of specific blood lymphoid cell types, age, sex, hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, and elevation of blood markers for systemic inflammation, was determined using multiple regression.

RESULTSAfter accounting for effects of age and sex, hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with 1.78-fold fewer ILCs (95%CI: 2.34-1.36; p = 4.55 x 10-5) and 2.31-fold fewer CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells (95%CI: 3.1-1.71; p = 1.04 x 10-7), when compared to uninfected controls. Among people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the odds ratio for hospitalization, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of symptoms, was 0.413 (95%CI: 0.197-0.724; p = 0.00691) for every 2-fold increase in ILCs. In addition, higher ILC abundance was associated with less time spent in the hospital and lower levels of blood markers associated with COVID-19 severity: each two-fold increase in ILC abundance was associated with a 9.38 day decrease in duration of hospital stay (95% CI: 15.76-3.01; p= 0.0054), and decrease in blood C-reactive protein (CRP) by 46.29 mg/L (95% CI: 71.34-21.24; p = 6.25 x 10-4), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) by 11.04 mm/h (95% CI: 21.94-0.13; p = 0.047), and the fibrin degradation product D-dimer by 1098.52 ng/mL (95% CI: 1932.84-264.19; p = 0.011).

CONCLUSIONSBoth ILCs and NK cells were depleted in the blood of people hospitalized for severe COVID-19, but, among lymphoid cell subsets, only ILC abundance was independently associated with the need for hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, and severity of inflammation. These results indicate that, by promoting disease tolerance, homeostatic ILCs protect against morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest that reduction in the number of ILCs with age and in males accounts for the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in these demographic groups.",Noah J.

273,Detection of SARS-Cov-2 RNA in serum is associated with increased mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has overloaded national health services worldwide. Thus, early identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes is critical. Our objective was to analyse SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum as a severity biomarker in COVID-19.

Methods and FindingsRetrospective observational study including 193 patients admitted for COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (CoVemia) was performed with samples collected at 48-72 hours of admission by two techniques from Roche and Thermo Fischer Scientific (TFS). Main outcome variables were mortality and need for ICU admission during hospitalization for COVID-19.

CoVemia was detected in 50-60% of patients depending on technique. The correlation of Ct in serum between both techniques was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.612; p < 0.001). Patients with CoVemia were older (p = 0.006), had poorer baseline oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2; p < 0.001), more severe lymphopenia (p < 0.001) and higher LDH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p = 0.021), C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.022) and procalcitonin (p = 0.002) serum levels.

We defined ""relevant CoVemia"" when detection Ct was < 34 with Roche and < 31 for TFS. These thresholds had 95% sensitivity and 35 % specificity. Relevant CoVemia predicted death during hospitalization (OR 9.2 [3.8 - 22.6] for Roche, OR 10.3 [3.6 - 29.3] for TFS; p < 0.001). Cox regression models, adjusted by age, sex and Charlson index, identified increased LDH serum levels and relevant CoVemia (HR = 9.87 [4.13-23.57] for TFS viremia and HR = 7.09 [3.3-14.82] for Roche viremia) as the best markers to predict mortality.

ConclusionsCoVemia assessment at admission is the most useful biomarker for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. CoVemia is highly reproducible with two different techniques (TFS and Roche), has a good consistency with other severity biomarkers for COVID-19 and better predictive accuracy.

AUTHOR SUMMARYCOVID-19 shows a very heterogeneous clinical picture. In addition, it has overloaded national health services worldwide. Therefore, early identification of patients with poor prognosis is critical to improve the use of limited health resources. In this work, we evaluated whether baseline SARS-CoV2 RNA detection in blood (CoVemia) is associated with worse outcomes. We studied almost 200 patients admitted to our hospital and about 50-60% of them showed positive CoVemia. Patients with positive CoVemia were older and had more severe disease; CoVemia was also more frequent in patients requiring admission to the ICU. Moreover, we defined ""relevant CoVemia"", as the amount of viral load that better predicted mortality obtaining 95% sensitivity and 35% specificity. In addition, relevant CoVemia was a better predictor than other biomarkers such as LDH, lymphocyte count, interleukin-6, and indexes used in ICU such as qSOFA and CURB65.

In summary, detection of CoVemia is the best biomarker to predict death in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, it is easy to be implemented and is reproducible with two techniques (Roche and Thermo Fisher Scientific) that are currently used for diagnosis in nasopharyngeal swabs samples.",Diego A.

274,The impact of high dose oral cotrimoxazole in patients with COVID-19 with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation: A Case Control Study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 can be fatal in a significant proportion of people who develop critical illness, resulting in hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which is thought to be mediated by a cytokine storm syndrome. Steroids have been shown to be of some benefit, but the mainstay of treatment remains supportive.

MethodsThe data was collected retrospectively from consecutive, newly diagnosed patients presenting to the critical care facility of I Q City Medical College Hospital, Durgapur, India between June and November 2020 with critical COVID-19 on non-invasive ventilation treated with high dose oral cotrimoxazole (CTX) in addition to standard therapy (ST) and compared with patients with critical COVID-19 receiving standard therapy alone.

Results201 patients were identified. Of which 151 patients received CTX in addition to ST (mean age {+/-} SD 59 {+/-} 13 years, 81% male and mean BMI {+/-} SD 28 {+/-} 2) and 50 patients received ST alone (mean age {+/-} SD 63 {+/-} 12, 64% male and mean BMI {+/-} SD 27 {+/-} 2). We observed that the patients with critical COVID-19 receiving CTX in addition to ST had significantly better outcomes including reduced in-patient mortality (13% versus 40%, p <0.001), length of hospital and critical care unit stay (mean, 11 versus 15 days (p <0.001) and 6 versus 11 days (p <0.001) respectively), and the need for mechanical ventilation (16% versus 42%, p <0.001) with improved CRP at day 7 (mean, 38mg/L versus 62mg/L, p = 0.001).

275,Optimising SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing strategies on social networks for low-resource settings,"Controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global challenge. The rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 directly reflects the social structure. Before effective vaccines and treatments are widely available, we have to rely on alternative, non-pharmaceutical interventions, including frequency testing, contact tracing, social distancing, mask wearing, and hand-washing, as public health practises to slow down the spread of the disease. However frequent testing is the key in the absence of any alternative. We propose a network approach to determine the optimal low resources setting oriented pool testing strategies that identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing, at low prevalence of the virus. We simulate stochastic infection curves on societies under quarantine. Allowing some social interaction is possible to keep the COVID-19 curve flat. However, similar results can be strategically obtained searching and isolating infected persons to preserve a healthier social structure. Here, we analyze which are the best strategies to contain the virus applying an algorithm that combine samples and testing them in groups [1]. A relevant parameter to keep infection curves flat using this algorithm is the dairy frequency of testing at zones where a high infection rate is reported. On the other hand, the algorithm efficiency is low for random search of infected people.",Karina I Mazzitello; Yi Jiang; Constancio Miguel Arizmendi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.20249064,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.20249064,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

277,Persistently increased systemic ACE2 activity and Furin levels are associated with increased inflammatory response in smokers with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19,"BackgroundTobacco smoking is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of several cardiopulmonary diseases, and smokers are susceptible to infectious agents. However, the progression of lung injury based on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity amongst smokers and those with pre-existing pulmonary diseases is not known. We determined the systemic expression and activity of COVID-19 related proteins, cytokine/chemokines, and lipid mediators (lipidomics) amongst COVID-19 patients with and without a history of smoking with a view to define biomarkers.

MethodsWe obtained serum from COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 recovered patients with and without a history of smoking. We conducted a Luminex multiplex assay (cytokine levels), LC/MS (eicosanoids or oxylipin panel) and enzymatic activity assays on the serum samples to study the systemic changes in COVID-19 patients.

ResultsOn comparing the cytokine profiles among COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients, we found a significant upregulation in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-8, IL-2, VEGF and IL-10 in COVID-19 positive patients as compared to the respective controls. Interestingly, smoking history resulted in further augmentation of the release of some hyper-inflammatory cytokines, like IFN-{gamma}, Eotaxin, MCP-1 and IL-9 amongst COVID-19 positive patients. The enzymatic activity for ACE2, the binding partner for SARS-CoV2 virus in the host cell, was found to be significantly increased in the serum of patients with a smoking history compared to the serum collected from the non-smoking controls. Similarly to our cytokine analysis, our measurement of serum Furin levels was also affected by the patients smoking history, in which we reported a substantial rise in serum Furin levels of COVID-19 patients. The analysis of lipid mediators revealed a distinct signature amongst the COVID-19 positive versus recovered subjects in PGF2, HETEs, LXA4 and LTB4 levels. However, we did not find any changes in the levels of any lipid mediators based on the smoking history of the patients. Overall, our results point towards distinct systemic signatures amongst COVID-19 positive patients. We also show that smoking adversely affects the systemic levels of inflammatory markers and COVID-19 related proteins, thus suggesting that COVID-19 infection may have severe outcomes amongst smokers which is reflected systemically.",Gagandeep Kaur; Shaiesh Yogeswaran; Thivanka Muthumalage; Irfan Rahman,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249836,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249836,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
278,Epidemiology of post-COVID syndrome following hospitalisation with coronavirus: a retrospective cohort study,"ObjectivesThe epidemiology of post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is currently undefined. We quantified rates of organ-specific impairment following recovery from COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with those in a matched control group, and how the rate ratio (RR) varies by age, sex, and ethnicity.

DesignObservational, retrospective, matched cohort study.

SettingNHS hospitals in England.

Participants47,780 individuals (mean age 65 years, 55% male) in hospital with COVID-19 and discharged alive by 31 August 2020, matched to controls on demographic and clinical characteristics.

Outcome measuresRates of hospital readmission, all-cause mortality, and diagnoses of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney and liver diseases until 30 September 2020.

ResultsMean follow-up time was 140 days for COVID-19 cases and 153 days for controls. 766 (95% confidence interval: 753 to 779) readmissions and 320 (312 to 328) deaths per 1,000 person-years were observed in COVID-19 cases, 3.5 (3.4 to 3.6) and 7.7 (7.2 to 8.3) times greater, respectively, than in controls. Rates of respiratory, diabetes and cardiovascular events were also significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases, at 770 (758 to 783), 127 (122 to 132) and 126 (121 to 131) events per 1,000 person-years, respectively. RRs were greater for individuals aged <70 than [&ge;] 70 years, and in ethnic minority groups than the White population, with the biggest differences observed for respiratory disease: 10.5 [9.7 to 11.4] for <70 years versus 4.6 [4.3 to 4.8] for [&ge;] 70 years, and 11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for Non-White versus 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) for White.

ConclusionsIndividuals discharged from hospital following COVID-19 face elevated rates of multi-organ dysfunction compared with background levels, and the increase in risk is neither confined to the elderly nor uniform across ethnicities.

ObjectThe object of this study was estimation of reproduction numbers by age class of the source of infection and the infected persons. To do so, after examining a new procedure for reproduction number estimation, we checked infected places by age class of the source of infection and the infected persons.

MethodWe ignore patients who infected no one because their reliability might be lower than that of patients who infected more than one person. We estimated the reproduction number from the histogram of the number of the infected people by the same patient, assuming that the histogram follows an exponential distribution.

Discussion and ConclusionThe obtained results demonstrated that the effective reproduction numbers for infection from children were very low. They were higher among adult and elderly people than among the same age class. Moreover, although the highest and second-highest infected places were  other and  at home with some exceptions, the data for infection at hospitals were remarkable among adults and elderly people. Among elderly people, infection at facilities for elderly was also high.

280,In vivo structure and dynamics of the RNA genome of SARS-Cov-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 pandemic, is one of the largest positive strand RNA viruses. Here we developed a simplified SPLASH assay and comprehensively mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the viral life cycle. We observed canonical and alternative structures including 3-UTR and 5-UTR, frameshifting element (FSE) pseudoknot and genome cyclization in cells and in virions. We provide direct evidence of interactions between Transcription Regulating Sequences (TRS-L and TRS-Bs), which facilitate discontinuous transcription. In addition, we reveal alternative short and long distance arches around FSE, forming a ""high-order pseudoknot"" embedding FSE, which might help ribosome stalling at frameshift sites. More importantly, we found that within virions, while SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA undergoes intensive compaction, genome cyclization is weakened and genome domains remain stable. Our data provides a structural basis for the regulation of replication, discontinuous transcription and translational frameshifting, describes dynamics of RNA structures during life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and will help to develop antiviral strategies.",Yan Zhang; Kun Huang; Dejian Xie; Jian You Lau; Wenlong Shen; Ping Li; Dong Wang; Zhong Zou; Shu Shi; Hongguang Ren; Meilin Jin; Grzegorz Kudla; Zhihu Zhao,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426526,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.426526,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,False
281,Structural characterization of cocktail-like targeting polysaccharides from Ecklonia kurome Okam and their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in vitro,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent responsible for the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Investigation has confirmed that polysaccharide heparan sulfate can bind to the spike protein and block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Theoretically, similar structure of nature polysaccharides may also have the impact on the virus. Indeed, some marine polysaccharide has been reported to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 infection in vitro, however the convinced targets and mechanism are still vague. By high throughput screening to target 3CLpro enzyme, a key enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the viral replication and transcription using nature polysaccharides library, we discover the mixture polysaccharide 375 from seaweed Ecklonia kurome Okam completely block 3Clpro enzymatic activity (IC50, 0.48 {micro}M). Further, the homogeneous polysaccharide 37502 from the 375 may bind to 3CLpro molecule well (kD value : 4.23 x 10-6). Very interestingly, 37502 also can potently disturb spike protein binding to ACE2 receptor (EC50, 2.01 {micro}M). Importantly, polysaccharide 375 shows good anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in cell culture with EC50 values of 27 nM (99.9% inhibiting rate at the concentration of 20 {micro}g/mL), low toxicity (LD50: 136 mg/Kg on mice). By DEAE ion-exchange chromatography, 37501, 37502 and 37503 polysaccharides are purified from native 375. Bioactivity test show that 37501 and 37503 may impede SARS-Cov-2 infection and virus replication, however their individual impact on the virus is significantly less that of 375. Surprisingly, polysaccharide 37502 has no inhibition effect on SARS-Cov-2. The structure study based on monosaccharide composition, methylation, NMR spectrum analysis suggest that 375 contains guluronic acid, mannuronic acid, mannose, rhamnose, glucouronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose and fucose with ratio of 1.86 : 9.56 : 6.81 : 1.69 : 1.00 : 1.75 : 1.19 : 11.06 : 4.31 : 23.06. However, polysaccharide 37502 is an aginate which composed of mannuronic acid (89.3 %) and guluronic acid (10.7 %), with the molecular weight (Mw) of 27.9 kDa. These results imply that mixture polysaccharides 375 works better than the individual polysaccharide on SARS-Cov-2 may be the cocktail-like polysaccharide synergistic function through targeting multiple key molecules implicated in the virus infection and replication. The results also suggest that 375 may be a potential drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2.",Kan Ding; Bo Zhang; Xinwen Chen; Yechun Xu; Chunfan Huang; Can Jin; Zhenyun Du; Xia Chen; Yaqi Ding; Hao Sun; Meixia Li; Rongjuan Pei; Shihai Zhang; Minbo Su; Yi Zhang; Jia Li,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426521,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426521,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,False

The fusion process is being carried out by fusion proteins present in the viral envelope. The class I viruses contains a 20-25 amino acid sequence at its N-terminal of the fusion domain, which is instrumental in fusion, and is termed as  fusion peptide. However, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS) coronaviruses contain more than one fusion peptide sequences. We have shown that the internal fusion peptide 1 (IFP1) of SARS-CoV is far more efficient than its N-terminal counterpart (FP) to induce hemifusion between small unilamellar vesicles. Moreover, the ability of IFP1 to induce hemifusion formation increases dramatically with growing cholesterol content in the membrane.

283,CAR-NK Cells Effectively Target the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2-infected Cells,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious presenting a significant public health issue. Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants, though the current therapeutic options remain limited and expensive. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet to be documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response. In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in preventing and treating severe cases of COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its D614G mutant. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody that targets the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, therefore would be more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G mutant. Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in vitro and show superior killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently published CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results pave the way for generating  off-the-shelf S309-CAR-NK cells for treatment in high-risk individuals as well as provide an alternative strategy for patients unresponsive to current vaccines.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426742,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426742,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,False

AimWe provide information on the effect of time-dependent passive decontamination at room temperature and evaluate inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a non-enveloped model virus as well as mask and respirator integrity following active multiple-cycle vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and dry heat (DH) decontamination.

MethodsMasks and respirators, inoculated with infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus or murine norovirus, were submitted to passive decontamination or single or multiple active decontamination cycles; viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured via TCID50 assay. In parallel, filtration efficiency tests and breathability tests were performed according to EN standard 14683 and NIOSH regulations.

Results and DiscussionInfectious porcine respiratory coronavirus and murine norovirus remained detectable on masks and respirators up to five and seven days of passive decontamination. Single and multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH were shown to not adversely affect bacterial filtration efficiency of masks. Single- and multiple UVGI did not adversely affect respirator filtration efficiency, while VHP and DH induced a decrease in filtration efficiency after one or three decontamination cycles. Multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH slightly decreased airflow resistance of masks but did not adversely affect respirator breathability. VHP and UVGI efficiently inactivated both viruses after five, DH after three, decontamination cycles, permitting demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude.

285,Development and evaluation of rapid data-enabled access to routine clinical information to enhance early recruitment to the national clinical platform trial of COVID-19 community treatments,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for rapidly designing, initiating, and delivering therapeutic clinical trials. PRINCIPLE is the UK national platform investigating repurposed therapies for COVID-19 treatment of older people in the community at high risk of complications. Standard methods of patient recruitment were failing to meet the required pace and scale of enrolment.

This paper describes the development and appraisal of a near real-time, data-driven, ethical approach for enhancing recruitment in community care by contacting people with a recent COVID-19 positive test result from the central NHS Test and Trace service within 24-48 hours of their test result.

MethodsA multi-disciplinary team was formed to solve the technical, ethical, public perception, logistical and information governance issues required to provide a near-real time (within 24-48 hours of receiving a positive test) feed of potential trial participants from test result data to the research team. PRINCIPLE was also given unique access to the Summary Care Record (SCR) to ensure safe prescribing, and to enable the trial team to quickly and safely bring consented patients into the trial. A survey of the public was used to understand public perceptions of the use of test data for this proposed methodology.

ResultsPrior to establishing the data service, PRINCIPLE registered on average 87 participants per week. This increased by up to 87 additional people registered per week from the test data, contributing to an increase from 1,013 recruits to PRINCIPLE at the start of October 2020 to 2,802 recruits by 20th December 2020.

While procedural caveats were identified by the public consultation, out of 2,639 people contacted by PRINCIPLE following a positive test result, no one raised a concern about being approached.

ConclusionsThis paper describes a novel approach to using near-real time NHS operational data to recruit community-based patients within a few days of presentation with acute illness.

This approach increased recruitment, and reduced time between positive test and randomisation, allowing more rapid evaluation of treatments and increased safety for participants. End-to-end public and patient involvement in the design of the approach provided evidence to inform information governance decisions.

Trial registrationPRINCIPLE is funded by UK Research and Innovation and the Department of Health and Social Care through the National Institute for Health Research.

286,"SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a cohort of 43,000 antibody-positive individuals followed for up to 35 weeks","BackgroundReinfection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been documented, raising public health concerns. Risk and incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were assessed in a large cohort of antibody-positive persons in Qatar.

MethodsAll SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons with a PCR-positive swab [&ge;]14 days after the first-positive antibody test were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection.

ResultsAmong 43,044 anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0-34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab [&ge;]14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the risk of reinfection was estimated at 0.10% (95% CI: 0.08-0.11%). The incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at >90%. Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing.

ConclusionsReinfection is rare. Natural infection appears to elicit strong protection against reinfection with an efficacy >90% for at least seven months.",Laith J Abu-Raddad; Hiam Chemaitelly; Peter Coyle; Joel A Malek; Ayeda A.

287,From SARS and MERS to COVID-19: a review of the quality and responsiveness of clinical management guidelines in outbreak settings,"ObjectiveTo assess the responsiveness and quality of clinical management guidelines (CMGs) in SARS, MERS and COVID-19 and determine whether this has improved over time.

DesignRapid literature review, quality assessment and focus group consultation.

Data Sources- Google and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception to 6th June 2020.This was supplemented with hand searches of national and international public health agency and infectious disease society websites as well as directly approaching clinical networks in regions where few CMGs had been identified via the primary search.

Eligibility CriteriaCMGs for the treatment of COVID-19/SARS/MERS providing recommendations on supportive care and/or specific treatment.

MethodsData extraction was performed using a standardised form. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE-II) tool was used to evaluate the quality of the CMGs. Six COVID-19 treatments were selected to assess the responsiveness of a subset of guidelines and their updates to 20th November 2020. We ran two sessions of focus groups with patient advocates to elicit their views on guideline development.

ResultsWe included 37 COVID-19, six SARS, and four MERS CMGs. Evidence appraisals in CMGs generally focused on novel drugs rather than basic supportive care; where evidence for the latter was provided it was generally of a low quality. Most CMGs had major methodological flaws (only two MERS-CoV and four COVID-19 CMGs were recommended for use by both reviewers without modification) and there was no evidence of improvement in quality over time. CMGs scored lowest in the following AGREE-II domains: scope and purpose, editorial independence, stakeholder engagement, and rigour of development. Of the COVID-19 CMGs, only eight included specific guidance for the management of elderly patients and only ten for high-risk groups; a further eight did not specify the target patient group at all. Early in the pandemic, multiple guidelines recommended unproven treatments and whilst in general findings of major clinical trials were eventually adopted, this was not universally the case. Eight guidelines recommended that use of unproven agents should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Patient representatives expressed concern about the lack of engagement with them in CMG development and that these documents are not accessible to non-experts.

ConclusionThe quality of most CMGs produced in coronaviridae outbreaks is poor and we have found no evidence of improvement over time, highlighting that current development frameworks must be improved. There is an need to strengthen the evidence base surrounding basic supportive care and develop methods to engage patients in CMG development from the beginning in outbreak settings.

288,"Increased infections, but not viral burden, with a new SARS-CoV-2 variant","BackgroundA new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01, was identified in the UK in December-2020. Direct estimates of its potential to enhance transmission are limited.

MethodsNose and throat swabs from 28-September-2020 to 2-January-2021 in the UKs nationally representative surveillance study were tested by RT-PCR for three genes (N, S and ORF1ab). Those positive only on ORF1ab+N, S-gene target failures (SGTF), are compatible with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. We investigated cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for viral load), percentage of positives, population positivity and growth rates in SGTF vs non-SGTF positives.

Results15,166(0.98%) of 1,553,687 swabs were PCR-positive, 8,545(56%) with three genes detected and 3,531(23%) SGTF. SGTF comprised an increasing, and triple-gene positives a decreasing, percentage of infections from late-November in most UK regions/countries, e.g. from 15% to 38% to 81% over 1.5 months in London. SGTF Ct values correspondingly declined substantially to similar levels to triple-gene positives. Population-level SGTF positivity remained low (<0.25%) in all regions/countries until late-November, when marked increases with and without self-reported symptoms occurred in southern England (to 1.5-3%), despite stable rates of non-SGTF cases. SGTF positivity rates increased on average 6% more rapidly than rates of non-SGTF positives (95% CI 4-9%) supporting addition rather than replacement with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. Excess growth rates for SGTF vs non-SGTF positives were similar in those up to high school age (5% (1-8%)) and older individuals (6% (4-9%)).

289,Correlation of Computerized Tomography (CT) Severity Score for COVID-19 pneumonia with Clinical Outcomes,"IntroductionVarious CT severity scores have already been described in literature since the start of this pandemic. One pertinent issue with all of the previously described severity scores is their relative challenging calculation and variance in inter-observer agreement. The severity score proposed in our study is relatively simpler, easier to calculate and apart from a trained radiologist, can easily be calculated even by physicians with good inter-observer agreement. Therefore, a rapid CT severity score calculation can give a clue to physician about possible clinical outcome without being dependent on radiologist who may not be readily available especially in third world countries.

ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to develop a simple CT severity score (CT-SS) with good inter-observer agreement and access its correlation with clinical outcome.

MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted by the Department of Radiology and Internal Medicine, at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, from April 2020 to August 2020. Non-probability consecutive sampling was used to include all patients who were positive for COVID-19 on PCR, and underwent CT chest examination at AKUH. Severity of disease was calculated in each lobe on the basis of following proposed CT severity scoring system (CT-SS). For each lobe the percentage of involvement by disease was scored - 0% involvement was scored 0, <50% involvement was scored 1 and >50% involvement was scored 2. Maximum score for one lobe was 2 and hence total maximum overall score for all lobes was 10. Continuous data was represented using mean and standard deviation, and compared using independent sample t-tests. Categorical data was represented using frequencies and percentages, and compared using Chi-squared tests. Inter-observer reliability between radiologist and COVID intensivist for the 10 point CT-SS rated on 0-10 was assessed using the Kappa statistic. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.

ResultsA total of 73 patients were included, the majority male (58.9%) with mean age 55.8 {+/-} 13.93 years. The CT-SS rated on 0-10 showed substantial inter-observer reliability between radiologist and intensivist with a Kappa statistic of 0.78. Patients with CT-SS 8-10 had a significantly higher ICU admission & intubation rate (53.8% vs. 23.5%) and mortality rate (35.9% vs. 11.8%; p = 0.017), as compared to those with CT-SS 0-7.

ConclusionWe conclude that the described CT severity score (CT-SS) is a quick, effective and easily reproducible tool for prediction of adverse clinical outcome in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia.

290,Distinct Patterns of Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variants including N501Y in Clinical Samples in Columbus Ohio,"Following the worldwide emergence of the p.Asp614Gly shift in the Spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2, there have been few recurring pathogenic shifts occurring during 2020, as assessed by genomic sequencing. This situation has evolved in the last several months with the emergence of several distinct variants (first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa) that manifest multiple changes in the S gene, particularly p.Asn501Tyr (N501Y), that likely have clinical impact. We report here the emergence in Columbus, Ohio in December 2020 of two novel SARS-CoV-2 clade 20G variants. One variant, that has become the predominant virus found in nasopharyngeal swabs in the December 2020-January 2021 period, harbors S p.Gln677His (Q677H), affecting a consensus QTQTN domain near the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, nucleocapsid (N) p.Asp377Tyr (D377Y) and membrane glycoprotein (M) p.Ala85Ser (A85S) mutations, with additional S mutations in subsets. The other variant present in two samples, contains S N501Y, which is a marker of the UK-B.1.1.7 (clade 20I/501Y.V1) strain, but lacks all other mutations from that virus. The Ohio variant is from a different clade and shares multiple mutations with the clade 20G viruses circulating in the area prior to December 2020. These two SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which we show are also present and evolving currently in several other parts of North America, add to the diversity of S gene shifts occurring worldwide. These and other shifts in this period of the pandemic support multiple independent acquisition of functionally significant and potentially complementing mutations affecting the S QTQTN site (Q675H or Q677H) and certain receptor binding domain mutations (e.g., E484K and N501Y).",Huolin Tu; Matthew R Avenarius; Laura Kubatko; Matthew Hunt; Xiaokang Pan; Peng Ru; Jason Garee; Keelie Thomas; Peter Mohler; Preeti Pancholi; Dan Jones,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426407,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426407,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,False

292,A Viral Fragmentation Signature for SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical Samples Correlating with Contagiousness,"The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples as measured by the primary diagnostic tool of RT-PCR is an imperfect readout for infection potential as most targeted assays designed for sensitivity, indiscriminately detect short and long RNA fragments, although infectivity is embodied only in the whole virus and its intact genome. Here, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize 155 clinical samples and show sensitive and quantitative detection of viral RNA which confirmed subgenomic RNA in 57.6% of samples and provided a novel method to determine relative integrity of viral RNA in samples. The relative abundance of long fragments quantified as a viral fragmentation score was positively associated with viral load and inversely related to time from disease onset. An empirically determined score cut-off for presence of substantially fragmented RNA was able to identify 100% of samples collected after 8 days of illness with poor infection potential in line with current clinical understanding of infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2. The quantification of longer fragments in addition to existing short targets in an NGS or RT-PCR-based assay could provide a valuable readout of infection potential simultaneous to the detection of any fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in test samples.",Yukti Choudhury; Chae Yin Cher; Zi Yi Wan; Chao Xie; Jing Shan Lim; Ramandeep Kaur Virk; Min Han Tan; Alvin Kuo Jing Teo; Li Yang Hsu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249265,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249265,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
293,"Intermediate-dose anticoagulation, aspirin, and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19: a propensity score-matched analysis","BackgroundThrombotic complications occur at high rates in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, yet the impact of intensive antithrombotic therapy on mortality is uncertain.

Research QuestionHow does in-hospital mortality compare with intermediate-versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, and separately with in-hospital aspirin versus no antiplatelet therapy, in treatment of COVID-19?

Study Design and MethodsUsing data from 2785 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients, we established two separate, nested cohorts of patients (1) who received intermediate- or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (""anticoagulation cohort"", N = 1624), or (2) who were not on home antiplatelet therapy and received either in-hospital aspirin or no antiplatelet therapy (""aspirin cohort"", N = 1956). Propensity score matching utilizing various markers of illness severity and other patient-specific covariates yielded treatment groups with well-balanced covariates in each cohort. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

ResultsAmong propensity score-matched patients in the anticoagulation cohort (N = 382), in a multivariable regression model, intermediate-compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.518 [0.308-0.872]). Among propensity-score matched patients in the aspirin cohort (N = 638), in a multivariable regression model, in-hospital aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.522 [0.336-0.812]).

InterpretationIn this propensity score-matched, observational study of COVID-19, intermediate-dose anticoagulation and aspirin were each associated with a lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

We observed higher levels of CCC reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative HCW compared to community donors, consistent with potential higher occupational exposure of HCW to CCC. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of seronegative HCW was higher than community controls and correlation between CCC and SARS-CoV-2 responses is consistent with cross-reactivity and not associated with recent in vivo activation. Surprisingly, CCC reactivity was decreased in SARS-CoV-2 infected HCW, suggesting that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might interfere with CCC responses, either directly or indirectly.

295,Genomic surveillance at scale is required to detect newly emerging strains at an early timepoint,"Genomic surveillance in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has the potential to identify emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains that may be more transmissible, virulent, evade detection by standard diagnostic tests, or vaccine escapes. The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 strain from southern England to other parts of the country and globe is a clear example of the impact of such strains. Early discovery of the B.1.1.7 strain was enabled through the proactive COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) program and the UKs commitment to genomic surveillance, sequencing about 10% of positive samples.1 In order to enact more aggressive public health measures to minimize the spread of such strains, genomic surveillance needs to be of sufficient scale to detect early emergence and expansion in the broader virus population. By modeling common performance characteristics of available diagnostic and sequencing tests, we developed a model that assesses the sampling required to detect emerging strains when they are less than 1% of all strains in a population. This model demonstrates that 5% sampling of all positive tests allows the detection of emerging strains when they are a prevalence of 0.1% to 1.0%. While each country will determine their risk tolerance for the emergence of novel strains, as vaccines are distributed and we work to end the pandemic and prevent future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, genomic surveillance will be an integral part of success.",Darcy Vavrek; Lucia Speroni; Kirsten J Curnow; Michael Oberholzer; Vanessa Moeder; Phillip G Febbo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249613,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249613,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

The incidence of viral causes of gastroenteritis, enteroaggregative/enteropathogenic/enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Cyclospora cayetanensis decreased sharply after shelter-in place took effsect, whilst Salmonella, Campylobacter, shiga toxin-producing E. coli (O157 and non-O157) and other bacterial and parasitic causes of gastroenteritis were largely unaffected.

299,An optimised protocol for detection of SARS-COV-2 in stool,"AimSARS-CoV-2 has been detected in stool samples of COVID-19 patients, with potential implications for faecal-oral transmission. Compared to swab samples, the complexity of the stool matrix poses a challenge in the detection of the virus that has not yet been solved. The aim of this study was to establish a sensitive and reliable method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples.

MethodsStool samples from individuals free of SARS-CoV-2 were homogenised in saline buffer and spiked with a known titre of inactivated virus ranging from 50 to 750 viral particles per 100 mg stool. Debris was removed via centrifugation and supernatants were concentrated by ultrafiltration. RNA was then extracted from the concentrated material using a commercial kit and SARS-CoV-2 was detected via real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using the CDC primers and probes.

ResultsThe RNA extraction procedure we used allowed the detection of SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR in most of the stool samples tested. We could detect as few as 50 viral particles per 100 mg of stool. However, high variability was observed across samples at low viral titres. The primer set targeting the N1 region provided more reliable and precise results and for this primer set our method had a limit of detection of 1 viral particle per mg of stool.

ConclusionsHere we describe a sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples. This method can be used to establish the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and ensure the safety of clinical practices such as faecal microbiota transplant (FMT).",Tianqi Li; Enriqueta Garcia-Gutierrez; Jacob Scadden; Jade Davies; Chloe Hutchins; Alp Aydin; Stefano Romano; Lizbeth Sayavedra; Justin O'Grady; Arjan Narbad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.20248606,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.20248606,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
300,Early immune pathology and persistent dysregulation characterise severe COVID-19,"In a study of 207 SARS-CoV2-infected individuals with a range of severities followed over 12 weeks from symptom onset, we demonstrate that an early robust immune response, without systemic inflammation, is characteristic of asymptomatic or mild disease. Those presenting to hospital had delayed adaptive responses and systemic inflammation already evident at around symptom onset. Such early evidence of inflammation suggests immunopathology may be inevitable in some individuals, or that preventative intervention might be needed before symptom onset. Viral load does not correlate with the development of this pathological response, but does with its subsequent severity. Immune recovery is complex, with profound persistent cellular abnormalities correlating with a change in the nature of the inflammatory response, where signatures characteristic of increased oxidative phosphorylation and reactive-oxygen species-associated inflammation replace those driven by TNF and IL-6. These late immunometabolic inflammatory changes and unresolved immune cell defects, if persistent, may contribute to ""long COVID"".",Laura Bergamaschi; Federica Mescia; Lorinda Turner; Aimee Hanson; Prasanti Kotagiri; Benjamin J.

301,Modelling the effect of lockdown,"1This note models the effect of the lockdown during the first wave of COVID-19. We use SEIR type of model with a certain time lag between infection and becoming infectious. Firstly we compare the timing of the change of the coefficient of infection, growth rate of confirmed cases corresponds to the change of mobility index, and secondly we assume the change of the coefficient of infection, activity index {beta} (analogous to R0) and fit the parameter to reproduce the actual number of confirmed cases. Finally, we assume that the activity index {beta} is proportional to the square of the mobility and fit the parameters. The curves in various cuontries fits reasonably well in any cases, but estimating {beta} from various parameters (including temperature) remains as an important task.",Hideto Kamei; Akihiro Sato,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.20248882,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.20248882,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
302,Mitigation of COVID-19 using social distancing of the elderly in Brazil: The vertical quarantine effects in hospitalizations and deaths,"Governments and epidemiologists have been proposing several mitigation strategies based on non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. In this work, we quantitatively compare the effects of elderly population (60 years old or more) selective isolation with a no isolation scenario using an adapted Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Removed (SEIR) compartmental model. For these simulated scenarios, we estimate the number of hospitalizations and deaths for different Brazilian cities, including those due to the lack of hospital beds. Our simulations show that, for Sao Paulo City, the isolation of the elderly would reduce demand for hospital beds by 9% and deaths by 16% compared to the no intervention scenario. Other Brazilian cities follow the same pattern, with median reductions of deaths ranging from 12-18%. We conclude that the social distancing of the elderly would be marginally effective and would not avoid health system collapse in several Brazilian cities.",Vito Ribeiro Venturieri; Matheus Silva Gonçalves; Vinicius Rios Fuck,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249495,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249495,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
303,"Characteristics and outcomes of 118,155 COVID-19 individuals with a history of cancer in the United States and Spain","PurposeWe aimed to describe the demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities and outcomes of patients with a history of cancer with COVID-19 from March to June 2020. Secondly, we compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients hospitalized with influenza.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study using eight routinely-collected healthcare databases from Spain and the US, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model. Three cohorts of patients with a history of cancer were included: i) diagnosed with COVID-19, ii) hospitalized with COVID-19, and iii) hospitalized with influenza in 2017-2018. Patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We reported demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes.

ResultsWe included 118,155 patients with a cancer history in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 41,939 in the COVID-19 hospitalized cohorts. The most frequent cancer subtypes were prostate and breast cancer (range: 5-19% and 1-14% in the diagnosed cohort, respectively). Hematological malignancies were also frequent, with non-Hodgkins lymphoma being among the 5 most common cancer subtypes in the diagnosed cohort. Overall, patients were more frequently aged above 65 years and had multiple comorbidities. Occurrence of death ranged from 8% to 14% and from 18% to 26% in the diagnosed and hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts, respectively. Patients hospitalized with influenza (n=242,960) had a similar distribution of cancer subtypes, sex, age and comorbidities but lower occurrence of adverse events.

ConclusionPatients with a history of cancer and COVID-19 have advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and a high occurence of COVID-19-related events.

In this line, repurposing existing drugs, against known or predicted SARS-CoV-2 protein actions, has been advanced, while natural products have also been tested. Previous work has shown that a Cretan Aromatic Plant (Thymbra capitata (L.) Cav., Salvia fruticosa Mill. and Origanum dictamnus L.) essential oil mixture (CAPeo) has a remarkable in vitro antiviral activity against Influenza A & B and Rhinovirus 14 strains, decreasing the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections, while proven safe in experimental animals and humans. Here, we tested CAPeo in VERO cells infected with SASR-CoV-2. We report that this mixture, at similar concentrations as those previously reported, exhibits a remarkable antiviral activity. Administration of 1 ml of a 1.5% CAPeo in olive oil, in a Proof-of-Concept intervention study in SARS-CoV-2-positive, exhibiting mild COVID-19 symptoms, humans resulted in a significant amelioration of general and local symptoms of the disease.

305,Impact of COVID-19 on Migrants' Access to Primary Care:A National Qualitative Study,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to considerable changes in the delivery of primary care in the UK, including rapid digitalisation, yet the extent to which these have impacted on marginalised migrant groups - already facing existing barriers to NHS care - is unknown. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of health professionals and migrants will support initiatives to deliver more effective health services, including delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, to marginalised groups.

AimTo understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants and their access to primary healthcare, and implications for COVID-19 vaccine roll out.

Design and SettingPrimary care professionals, administrative staff, and migrants (foreign born; >18 years; <10 years in UK), were recruited in three phases using purposive, convenience and snowball sampling from urban, suburban and rural settings.

MethodsIn-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis.

Results64 clinicians were recruited in Phase 1 (25 GPs, 15 nurses, 7 HCAs, 1 Pharmacists); Phase 2 comprised administrative staff (11 PMs and 5 receptionists); and in Phase 3 we recruited 17 migrants (88% asylum seekers; 65% female; mean time in UK 4 years). We found that digitalisation and virtual consultations (telephone, video, and online form-based) have amplified existing inequalities in access to healthcare for many migrants due to lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers. Use of virtual consultations has resulted in concerns around building trust and the risk of missing safeguarding cues. Participants highlighted challenges around registering and accessing healthcare due to the physical closure of surgeries. Participants reported indirect discrimination, language and communication barriers, and lack of access to targeted and tailored COVID-19 information or interventions. In addition, migrants reported a range of specific beliefs around COVID-19 and on potential COVID-19 vaccines, from acceptance to mistrust, often influenced by misinformation. PCPs raised concerns that migrants may have increased risk factors for poor general health and to severe illness from COVID-19, in part due to their social and economic situation. Innovative opportunities were suggested to engage migrant groups through translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube which merit further exploration.

ConclusionPandemic-related changes in primary care delivery may be here to stay, and some migrant groups are at risk of digital exclusion and may need targeted additional support to access services. As primary care networks operationalise the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, these findings provide critical information on specific strategies required to support migrant population to access primary care and overcome misinformation around COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine.

How this fits inThe impact of pandemic-related shifts in primary care delivery on marginalised migrant groups, who may already face major disparities in accessing primary care, is poorly elucidated. We found that the rapid digitalisation of primary care services and physical closure of surgeries during the pandemic have amplified disparities in access to healthcare for specific migrant groups, with many lacking access to and capacity to use technology, compounded by language barriers. Migrants may be at increased risk of misinformation about COVID-19, which merits further consideration as COVID-19 vaccine roll out begins. Improved outreach to local migrant community organisations and places of worship, alongside co-designing with migrants more inclusive delivery approaches and creative integration of migrant ambassadors into information-sharing campaigns are needed. Primary care can maximise the opportunities of digitalisation for migrants through flexible engagement by multiple modalities (e.g. text, email, letter and YouTube videos) to provide targeted, translated advice and information, virtual group consultations for patients with a specific condition, and working with local leaders and NGOs to access and disseminate information through informal communication channels.",Felicity Knights; Jessica Carter; Anna Deal; Alison F Crawshaw; Sally E Hayward; Lucinda Jones; Sally Hargreaves,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249692,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249692,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
306,Physicians' Reactions to COVID-19: The Results of an International Internet Survey,"ObjectivesPhysicians across the world have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was designed and conducted to assess the emotional, cognitive, and behavioural reactions of physicians to the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Materials and methodsAn online survey questionnaire using the google forms platform was constructed by the authors. The items in the questionnaire were based on clinical experience, relevant literature review and discussion with peers. A list of issues that were deemed as essential components of the experience of the pandemic relevant to physicians was arrived at. Thereafter these issues were operationalized into question form and hosted on the google forms platform. The link to this questionnaire was circulated by the authors among their peer groups in the month of April 2020.

ResultsWe received 295 responses and 3 were unusable. Most of the responses were from India, the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. About 60% of the respondents identified themselves as frontline and had a decade of clinical experience. Most respondents reported being anxious due to the pandemic and also observed the same in their peers and families. A majority also observed changes in behaviour in self and others and advanced a variety of reasons and concerns. A sense of duty was the most commonly employed coping mechanism.

ConclusionPhysicians are not immune from information and misinformation, or cues in the environment. Behavioural choices are not always predicted by knowledge but by a combination of knowledge, emotional state, personality and environment. Healthcare settings need to be ready for emergencies and should focus on reducing uncertainty in physicians. These factors may also be gainfully used in the mental health promotion of physicians in COVID-19 care roles.",Parul Aneja; Inderjit Singh; Bhupinder Singh; Pardeep Singh Kundi; Inderbir Singh; Sanjana Kathiravan; Shubh Mohan Singh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249460,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249460,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
307,A national survey of potential acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in healthcare workers in Egypt,"BackgroundSince the start of COVID-19 outbreak investigators are competing to develop and exam vaccines against COVID-19. It would be valuable to protect the population especially health care employees from COVID-19 infection. The success of COVID-19 vaccination programs will rely heavily on public willingness to accept the vaccine.

AimsThis study aimed to describe the existing COVID-19 vaccine approval landscape among the health care providers and to identify the most probable cause of agreement or disagreement of COVID-19 vaccine.

MethodsA cross-sectional online survey was done.

ResultsThe present study included 496 health care employees, 55% were at age group from 18-45 years old. History of chronic diseases was recorded in 40.4%, and definite history of drug/food allergy in 10.1%. Only 13.5% totally agree to receive the vaccine, 32.4% somewhat agree and 40.9% disagreed to take the vaccine. Causes of disagreement were none safety, fear of genetic mutation and recent techniques and believe that the vaccine is not effective (57%, 20.2%, 17.7% and 16.6% respectively). The most trusted vaccine was the mRNA based vaccine. The age of health care employees and the presence of comorbidities or chronic diseases were the main factors related to COVID-19 acceptance (P<0.001 and 0.02 respectively).

ConclusionVaccine hesitancy is not uncommon in healthcare employees in Egypt and this may be an alarming barrier of vaccine acceptance in the rest of population.

308,Changes in the Health of Adolescent Athletes: A Comparison of Health Measures Collected Before and During the CoVID-19 Pandemic,"ContextIn the spring of 2020, schools closed to in-person teaching and sports were cancelled to control the transmission of CoVID-19. The changes that took place to the physical and mental health among young athletes during this time remain unknown, however.

ObjectiveIdentify changes in the health (mental health, physical activity and quality of life) of athletes that occurred during the CoVID-19 pandemic.

DesignCross sectional study.

SettingSample recruited via social media.

Patients or Other Participants3243 Wisconsin adolescent athletes (age=16.2{+/-}1.2 yrs., female=58% female) completed an online survey in May 2020 (DuringCoVID-19). Health measures for this cohort were compared with previously reported data for Wisconsin adolescent athletes (n=5231, age=15.7{+/-}1.2, 47% female) collected in 2016-2018 (PreCoVID-19).

Main Outcome Measure(s)Demographic information included: sex, grade and sports played. Health assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) to identify depression symptoms, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for health related quality of life (HRQoL). Univariable comparisons of these variables between groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each group were estimated by survey weighted ANOVA models.

RESULTSCompared to PreCoVID-19, a larger proportion of the During-CoVID-19 participants reported rates of moderate to severe levels of depression (9.7% vs 32.9%, p<0.001). During-CoVID-19 participants reported 50% lower (worse) PFABS scores (mean:12.2 [95%CI: 11.9, 12.5] vs 24.7 [24.5, 24.9] p<0.001) and lower (worse) PedsQL total scores compared to the PreCoVID-19 participants (78.4 [78.0, 78.8] vs. 90.9 [90.5, 91.3] p<0.001).

CONCLUSIONSDuring the CoVID-19 pandemic, adolescent athletes reported increased symptoms of depression, decreased physical activity and decreased quality of life compared to adolescent athletes in previous years.

Key pointsO_LIAdolescent athletes during CoVID-19 were three times more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of depression compared to data collected prior to CoVID-19.

309,Regional Variation in COVID-19 Scarce Resource Allocation Protocols,"BackgroundScarce resource allocation policies vary across the United States. Little is known about regional variation in hospital-level resource allocation protocols and variation in their application.

ObjectiveTo evaluate how scarce resource allocation policies throughout the Chicagoland area vary and whether there are differences in policy application within and amongst hospitals.

DesignTwo cross-sectional surveys.

SettingChicagoland hospitals.

ParticipantsRepresentatives from Chicagoland hospitals and triage officers at these hospitals.

MeasurementsSurvey responses and categorical variables are described by frequency of occurrence. Intra- and interhospital variation in ranking of hypothetical patients was assessed using Kappa coefficients.

ResultsEight Chicago area hospitals responded to the survey assessing scarce resource allocation protocols. For hospitals willing to describe their specific ventilator allocation protocol (n=7), the initial scoring system varied with most utilizing the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (86%) and medical comorbidities (57%). A majority gave priority to pre-defined groups in their initial scoring system (86%), all discussed withdrawal of mechanical ventilation for adult patients (100%), and a minority had exclusion criteria (43%). Forty-nine triage officers from nine hospitals responded to the second survey. Triage officer rankings of hypothetical patients had slight agreement amongst all hospitals (Kappa 0.158) and fair agreement within two hospitals with the most respondents (Kappa 0.21 and 0.25). Almost half of triage officer respondents reported using tiebreakers to rank patients (N=23/49, 47%).

ConclusionAlthough most Chicago area hospitals surveyed created guidelines for resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic, these guidelines and application of these protocols by triage officers varied significantly.

311,Real-Time Electronic Health Record Mortality Prediction During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Cohort Study,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions of people, overwhelming critical care resources in some regions. Many plans for rationing critical care resources during crises are based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The COVID-19 pandemic created an emergent need to develop and validate a novel electronic health record (EHR)-computable tool to predict mortality.

Research QuestionsTo rapidly develop, validate, and implement a novel real-time mortality score for the COVID-19 pandemic that improves upon SOFA.

Study Design and MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study of a regional health system with 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. All patients >14 years old hospitalized during the study period without a do not resuscitate order were included. Patients were stratified by the diagnosis of COVID-19. From this cohort, we developed and validated a model using stacked generalization to predict mortality using data widely available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index.

ResultsWe prospectively analyzed 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) included intensive care unit (ICU)-level care, 1,480 (5.4%) included invasive mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted overall mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted overall mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, we predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85.

InterpretationWe developed and validated an accurate, in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model, that improved upon SOFA.

Take Home PointsO_ST_ABSStudy QuestionC_ST_ABSCan we improve upon the SOFA score for real-time mortality prediction during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging electronic health record (EHR) data?

ResultsWe rapidly developed and implemented a novel yet SOFA-anchored mortality model across 12 hospitals and conducted a prospective cohort study of 27,296 adult hospitalizations, 1,358 (5.0%) of which were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted all-cause mortality with AUROCs of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted mortality with AUROC 0.94.

ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to identify transmission scenarios that could underly rapid, widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection among inmates in Marion Correctional Institution (MCI).

DesignPublicly available data reported by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections (ODRC) was analyzed using mathematical and statistical models.

SettingWe consider SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics among MCI inmates prior to and including April 16, 2020.

ParticipantsThis study uses de-identified, publicly available SARS-CoV-2 test result data for MCI inmates.

ExposuresInmates at MCI were considered exposed to potential infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Main outcome and measuresResults from mass testing conducted on April 16, 2020 were analyzed together with time of first reported SARS-CoV-2 infection among MCI inmates.

ResultsRapid, widespread infection of MCI inmates was reported, with nearly 80% of inmates infected within three weeks of first reported inmate case. These data are consistent with i) a basic reproduction number greater than 14, together with a single initially infected inmate, ii) an initial super-spreading event resulting in several hundred initially infected inmates, together with a basic reproduction number of approximately three, and iii) earlier undetected circulation of virus among inmates prior to April.

Conclusions and relevanceMass testing data are consistent with extreme transmissibility, super-spreading events, or undetected circulation of virus among inmates. All scenarios consistent with these data attest to the vulnerabilities of prisoners to COVID-19.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSTo identify transmission characteristics consistent with timing and extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection among inmates in Marion Correctional Institution.

FindingsMathematical and statistical modeling finds three scenarios that are consistent with the observed widespread infection in Marion Correctional Institution: i) very high transmissibility corresponding to a basic reproduction number in the double digits, ii) an initial super-spreading event involving exposure of several hundred inmates, iii) undetected circulation of virus prior to the first documented case among inmates.

314,Estimating and forecasting the burden and spread of SARS-CoV2 first wave in Colombia.,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWFollowing the rapid dissemination of COVID-19 cases in Colombia in 2020, large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented as national emergencies in most of the municipalities of the country starting by a lockdown on March 20th of 2020. Using combinations of meta-population models SEAIIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infected-Recovered-Diseased) which describes the disease dynamics in the different localities, with movement data that accounts for the number of commuters between units and statistical inference algorithms could be an effective approach to both nowcast and forecast the number of cases and deaths in the country. Here we used an iterated filtering (IF) framework to fit the parameters of our model to the reported data across municipalities from march to late October in locations with more than 50 reported deaths and cases historically. Since the model is high dimensional (6 state variable by municipality) inference on those parameters is highly non-trivial, so we used an Ensemble-Adjustment-Kalman-Filter (EAKF) to estimate time variable system states and parameters. Our results show that the model is capable of capturing the evolution of the outbreak in the country and providing estimates of the epidemiological parameters in time. These estimates could become the base for planning future interventions as well as evaluate the impact of NPIs on the effective reproductive number ([R]eff) and the key epidemiological parameters, such as the contact rate or the reporting rate. Our approach demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts can provide robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in Colombia. This model has the potential to be used as a forecasting and prediction tool to evaluate disease dynamics and to develop a real time surveillance system for management and control.",Jaime Enrique Cascante Vega; Juan Manuel Cordovez; Mauricio Santos-Vega Sr.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249818,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249818,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
315,Comparison and analysis of various complementary diagnosis methods for the current situation and problems of COVID-19 diagnosis,"We evaluated and compared the diagnostic performance of fluorescence immunoassay (FIA) and two types of serological diagnostic tests: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody to diagnose COVID-19 infections. This study is aimed to analyze and compare the current status and problems of COVID-19 diagnosis and various alternative diagnostic methods that are viable. The enrolled subjects in our study population were tested with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ELISA and immunochromatographic diagnostic kit were used to diagnose 362 positive and 3010 negative SARS-CoV-2 specimens, and antigen fluorescence immunoassay kit was used on 62 positive and 70 negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed samples for diagnosis. As a result, categorizing by the patient symptom onset days, PCL COVID19 Total Ab EIA (ELISA) showed the sensitivity of 93.4% from 15 to 21 days, 94.2% from over 22 days, and the specificity of 99.97%. PCL COVID19 IgG/IgM Rapid Gold (ICA) had a sensitivity of 86.9%, 97.4%, and the specificity of 98.14% respectively. PCL COVID19 Ag Rapid FIA sensitivity was 93.8% from 0 to 7 days, 71.4% from 8 to 12 days and specificity was 98.57%.

316,"SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, transmission, health-related outcomes and control strategies in homeless shelters: systematic review and meta-analysis","BackgroundPeople experiencing homelessness (PEH) may be at particular risk for COVID19. We synthesised the evidence on SARS-Cov-2 infection, transmission, outcomes of disease, effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and the effectiveness of targeted strategies for infection prevention and control (IPC).

MethodsSystematic review of articles, reports and grey-literature indexed in electronic databases (EMBASE, WHO-Covid19, Web of Science), pre-print repositories, institutional websites, and handsearching. Empirical papers of any study design addressing Covid-19 in PEH or homeless shelters staff in English were included. (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020187033)

FindingsOf 194 publications, 13 studies were included (two modelling, ten observational and one qualitative study). All were conducted in high-income countries. Random-effect meta-analysis of prevalence estimates yields a baseline SARS-Cov-2 prevalence of 2{middle dot}14% (95% Confidence-Interval, 95%CI=1{middle dot}02-3{middle dot}27) in PEH and 1{middle dot}72 % (95%CI=0{middle dot}31-3{middle dot}12) in staff. In outbreaks, the pooled prevalence increases to 29{middle dot}49% (95%CI=16{middle dot}44-29{middle dot}55) in PEH and 15{middle dot}18% (95%CI=8{middle dot}95-21{middle dot}42) in staff. Main IPC strategies were universal and rapid testing, expansion of non-congregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters (bed spacing, limited staff rotation).

InterpretationUp to 30% PEH and 17% staff are infected during outbreaks of SARS-Cov-2 in homeless shelters. Most studies were conducted in the USA. No studies were found on health-related outcomes or health effects of NPI. An overview and evaluation of IPC strategies for PEH, including a better understanding of disease transmission, and reliable data on PEH within Covid-19 notification systems is needed. Qualitative studies may serve to voice PEH experiences and guide future evaluations and IPC strategies.

FundingNo source of funding.

Panel 1: Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPeople experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at increased risk of infectious, chronic, and mental health adverse conditions. Due to the risk of transmission in shared accommodations, PEH may be particularly vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken to mitigate the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak may have further aggravated health and social conditions. However, there is no evidence synthesis on the SARS-Cov-2 epidemiology among PEH, the correspondent clinical and other health-related outcomes as well as health effects of NPIs on these groups.

Added value of this study

We reviewed and synthesized existent evidence on the risk of infection and transmission, risk of severe course of disease, effect of NPIs on health outcomes and the effectiveness of implemented measures to avert risks and negative outcomes among PEH. Results of the identified studies suggest that both PEH and shelter staff are at high risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection, especially in case of a local outbreak. Due to the low prevalence of symptoms at the time of a positive SARS-Cov-2 test among PEH, symptom screening alone may not be efficient to control outbreaks. Instead, universal and rapid testing conjugated with expansion of non-congregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters, are discussed as sensible strategies.

Implications of all the available evidence

A comprehensive overview of NPIs and shelter strategies targeting PEH and evaluation of their effectiveness and unintended health consequences is needed.

317,COVID-19: Rapid Antigen detection for SARS-CoV-2 by lateral flow assay: a national systematic evaluation for mass-testing,"BackgroundNew lateral flow device (LFD) viral antigen immunoassays have been developed by commercial and research organisations around the world as diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To support decisions by the UK Government on potential scale-up of mass population testing, we have at their request evaluated the diagnostic performance of a significant number of point-of-care rapid SARS-CoV-2 LFDs.

Methods132 LFDs were initially reviewed by a Department of Health and Social Care team, part of the UK government, from which 64 were selected for further evaluation. Standardised laboratory evaluations, and for those that met the published criteria, field testing in the Falcon-C19 research study and UK pilots were performed (UK COVID-19 testing centres, hospital, schools, armed forces).

Results4/64 LFDs so far have desirable performance characteristics from independent laboratory studies and early preliminary field evaluations (Orient Gene, Deepblue and Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test), of which one underwent extended clinical assessment in field studies (Innova). 8951 Innova LFD tests were performed with a kit failure rate of 5.6% (502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1-6.1), false positive rate of 0.32% (22/6954, 95% CI: 0.20-0.48) and a viral antigen detection/sensitivity (using RNA RT-PCR as a proxy for the presence of antigen) of 78.8% when performed by laboratory scientists (156/198, 95% CI 72.4-84.3). Sensitivity was significantly lower when testing was undertaken by non-experts with limited initial training

InterpretationSeveral LFDs have promising performance characteristics for mass population testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals. The Innova LFD shows good viral antigen detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential issues. These results support the expanded evaluation of LFDs, and assessment of greater access to testing on COVID-19 transmission.

318,Understanding COVID-19 dynamics and the effects of interventions in the Philippines: A mathematical modelling study,"BackgroundCOVID-19 appears to have caused less severe outbreaks in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) compared with high-income countries, possibly because of differing demographics, socio-economics, climate, surveillance, and policy responses. The Philippines is a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak but has recently curtailed transmission while gradually easing interventions.

MethodsWe applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a ""Minimum Health Standards"" policy, MHS) to represent the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and projected the impacts of easing interventions.

ResultsPopulation age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. Several of the fitted epidemiological parameters were consistent with those reported in high-income settings. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 15-32%. The December 2020 case detection rate was estimated at [~]14%, population recovered at [~]12%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, and mobility, and the epidemic can be understood within a similar framework as for high-income settings. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS measures should allow the Philippines to maintain epidemic control, but disease resurgence remains a threat due to low population immunity and detection rates.",Jamie M Caldwell; Elvira de Lara-Tuprio; Timothy Robin Y Teng; Maria Regina Justina E Estuar; Raymond Francis Sarmiento; Milinda Abayawardana; Robert Neil F Leong; Richard T Gray; James G Wood; Emma McBryde; Romain Ragonnet; James M Trauer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249848,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249848,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
319,The cellular immune response to COVID-19 deciphered by single cell multi-omics across three UK centres,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in excess morbidity and mortality as well as economic decline. To characterise the systemic host immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing coupled with analysis of cell surface proteins, providing molecular profiling of over 800,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 130 patients with COVID-19. Our cohort, from three UK centres, spans the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease severities ranging from asymptomatic to critical. Three control groups were included: healthy volunteers, patients suffering from a non-COVID-19 severe respiratory illness and healthy individuals administered with intravenous lipopolysaccharide to model an acute inflammatory response. Full single cell transcriptomes coupled with quantification of 188 cell surface proteins, and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoires have provided several insights into COVID-19: 1. a new non-classical monocyte state that sequesters platelets and replenishes the alveolar macrophage pool; 2. platelet activation accompanied by early priming towards megakaryopoiesis in immature haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and expansion of megakaryocyte-primed progenitors; 3. increased clonally expanded CD8+ effector:effector memory T cells, and proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with more severe disease; and 4. relative increase of IgA plasmablasts in asymptomatic stages that switches to expansion of IgG plasmablasts and plasma cells, accompanied with higher incidence of BCR sharing, as disease severity increases. All data and analysis results are available for interrogation and data mining through an intuitive web portal. Together, these data detail the cellular processes present in peripheral blood during an acute immune response to COVID-19, and serve as a template for multi-omic single cell data integration across multiple centers to rapidly build powerful resources to help combat diseases such as COVID-19.",Emily Stephenson; Gary Reynolds; Rachel A Botting; Fernando J Calero-Nieto; Michael Morgan; Zewen Kelvin Tuong; Karsten Bach; Waradon Sungnak; Kaylee B Worlock; Masahiro Yoshida; Natsuhiko Kumasaka; Katarzyna Kania; Justin Engelbert; Bayanne Olabi; Jarmila Stremenova Spegarova; Nicola K Wilson; Nicole Mende; Laura Jardine; Louis CS Gardner; Issac Goh; Dave Horsfall; Jim McGrath; Simone Webb; Michael W Mather; Rik GH Lindeboom; Emma Dann; Ni Huang; Krzysztof Polanski; Elena Prigmore; Florian Gothe; Jonathan Scott; Rebecca P Payne; Kenneth F Baker; Aidan T Hanrath; Ina CD Schim van der Loeff; Andrew S Barr; Amada Sanchez-Gonzalez; Laura Bergamaschi; Federica Mescia; Josephine L Barnes; Eliz Kilich; Angus de Wilton; Anita Saigal; Aarash Saleh; Sam M Janes; Claire M Smith; Nusayhah Gopee; Caroline Wilson; Paul Coupland; Jonathan M Coxhead; Vladimir Y Kiselev; Stijn van Dongen; Jaume Bacardit; Hamish W King; Anthony J Rostron; A John Simpson; Sophie Hambleton; Elisa Laurenti; Paul A Lyons; Kerstin B Meyer; Marko Z Nikolic; Christopher JA Duncan; Ken Smith; Sarah A Teichmann; Menna R Clatworthy; John C Marioni; Berthold Gottgens; Muzlifah Haniffa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249725,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249725,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
320,Mapping SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Epitopes in COVID-19 Patients with a Multi-Coronavirus Protein Microarray,"The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated research and development for controlling the pandemic. A multi-coronavirus protein microarray was created containing full-length proteins, overlapping protein fragments of varying lengths and peptide libraries from SARS-CoV-2 and four other human coronaviruses. Sera from confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as unexposed individuals were applied to multi-coronavirus arrays to identify specific antibody reactivity. High level IgG, IgM and IgA reactivity to structural proteins S, M and N, as well as accessory proteins, of SARS-CoV-2 were observed that was specific to COVID-19 patients. Overlapping 100, 50 and 30 amino acid fragments of SARS-CoV-2 proteins identified antigenic regions. Numerous proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were also more reactive with IgG, IgM and IgA in COVID-19 patient sera than in unexposed control sera, providing further evidence of immunologic cross-reactivity between these viruses.

321,Real-time optical analysis of a colorimetric LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva with a handheld instrument improves accuracy compared to endpoint assessment,"Controlling the course of the COVID-19 pandemic will require widespread deployment of consistent and accurate diagnostic testing of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, tests should detect a minimum viral load, be minimally invasive, and provide a rapid and simple readout. Current FDA-approved RT-qPCR-based standard diagnostic approaches require invasive nasopharyngeal swabs and involve laboratory-based analyses that can delay results. Recently, a loop mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) test that utilizes colorimetric readout received FDA approval. This approach utilizes a pH indicator dye to detect drop in pH from nucleotide hydrolysis during nucleic acid amplification. This method has only been approved for use with RNA extracted from clinical specimens collected via nasopharyngeal swabs. In this study, we developed a quantitative LAMP-based strategy to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. Our detection system distinguished positive from negative sample types using a handheld instrument that monitors optical changes throughout the LAMP reaction. We used this system in a streamlined LAMP testing protocol that could be completed in less than two hours to directly detect inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in minimally processed saliva that bypassed RNA extraction, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 genomes/reaction. The quantitative method correctly detected virus in 100% of contrived clinical samples spiked with inactivated SARS- CoV-2 at either 1X (50 genomes/reaction) or 2X (100 genomes/reaction) of the LOD. Importantly the quantitative method was based on dynamic optical changes during the reaction so was able to correctly classify samples that were misclassified by endpoint observation of color.",Lena Diaz; Brandon E.

322,"A Novel Multiplex PCR Based Detection Assay Using Saliva or Nasopharyngeal Samples for SARS-Cov-2, Influenza A and B: Clinical Validation and Utility for Mass Surveillance.","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant diversion of human and material resources to COVID-19 diagnostics, to the extent that testing of viral pathogens normally contributing to seasonal respiratory tract infections have been markedly neglected. The global health burden due to influenza viruses and co-infection in COVID-19 patients remains undocumented but clearly pose serious public health consequences. To address these clinical and technical challenges, we have optimized and validated a highly sensitive RT-PCR based multiplex assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and B viruses in a single test.

MethodsThis study evaluated clinical specimens (n=1411) that included 1019 saliva and 392 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples collected in either healthcare or community setting. Samples were tested using two assays: FDA-EUA approved SARS-CoV-2 assay that targets N and ORF1ab gene, and the PKamp RT-PCR based assay that targets SARS-CoV-2, Influenza viruses A and B. The limit of detection (LoD) studies was conducted as per the FDA guidelines using SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A and B reference control materials.

ResultsOf the 1019 saliva samples, 17.0% (174/1019) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either assay. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with our multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [91.9% (160/174) vs. 87.9% (153/174)], respectively. Of the 392 NPS samples, 10.4% (41/392) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either assay. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with our multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [97.5% (40/41) vs. 92.1% (39/41)], respectively. The Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 were comparable between the two assays, whereas the Ct values of the housekeeping gene was significantly lower with multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay. The LoD was established as 60 copies/ml for SARS-CoV-2 and 180 copies/ml for Influenza A and B viruses for both saliva and NPS samples.

ConclusionThis study presents clinical validation of a multiplex PCR assay for testing SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and B viruses, using NPS and saliva samples, and demonstrates the feasibility of implementing the assay without disrupting the existing laboratory workflow.

323,Mass Testing with Contact Tracing Compared to Test and Trace for Effective Suppression of COVID-19 in the UK: A rapid review,"BackgroundMaking testing available to everyone and tracing contacts might be the gold standard towards the control of COVID-19, particularly when significant transmissions are without symptoms. This study evaluated the effectiveness of mass testing and contact tracing in the suppression of COVID-19 compared to conventional Test and Trace in the UK.

DesignA rapid review of available evidence

Primary research questionIs there evidence that mass testing and tracing could suppress community spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections better than Test and Trace?

Secondary research questionWhat is the proportion of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported during mass testing interventions?

MethodsLiterature was searched in September through December 2020 in Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Mendeley and PubMed.

ResultsLiterature search yielded 286 articles from Google Scholar, 20 from Science Direct, 14 from Mendeley, 27 from Pubmed and 15 through manual search. Altogether 35 articles were included, making a sample size of close to a million participants.

ConclusionThere was a very low level but promising evidence of 76.9% (95% CI: 46.2 - 95.0, P=0.09) majority vote in favour of the intervention under the primary objective. The overall proportion of asymptomatic cases among those tested positive and tested sample populations under the secondary objective was 40.7% (95% CI: 38.8- 42.5) and 0.01% (95% CI: 0.01 - 0.012) respectively.

324,Nasopharyngeal and serological anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA responses in COVID-19 patients.,"BackgroundThe systemic antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients has been extensively studied. However, much less is known about the mucosal responses in the upper airways at the site of initial SARS-CoV-2 replication. Local antibody responses in the nasopharyngeal epithelium, that are likely to determine the course of infection, have not been analysed so far nor their correlation with antibody responses in serum.

MethodsThe IgG and IgA antibody responses were analysed in the plasma as well as in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from the first four COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR in France. Two were pauci-symptomatic while two developed severe disease. Taking advantage of a comprehensive series of plasma and nasopharyngeal samples, we characterized their antibody profiles from the second week post symptoms onset, by using an in-house ELISA to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (N) IgG and IgA.

ResultsAnti-N IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in the NPS of severe patients. Overall, the levels of IgA and IgG antibodies in plasma and NPS appeared specific to each patient.

ConclusionsAnti-N IgG and IgA antibodies are detected in NPS, and their levels are related to antibody levels in plasma. The two patients with severe disease exhibited different antibody profiles that may reflect different disease outcome. For the pauci-symptomatic patients, one showed a low anti-N IgG and IgA response in the plasma only, while the other one did not exhibit overt serological response.",Bernadette Crescenzo-Chaigne; Sylvie Behillil; Vincent Enouf; Nicolas Escriou; Stephane Petres; Marie Noelle Ungeheuer; Jade Ghosn; Sarah Tubiana; Lila Bouadma; Sylvie van der Werf; Caroline Demeret; - French COVID cohort study group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.20249038,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.20249038,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
325,School and community reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mathematical modeling study,"BackgroundThe closure of communities, including schools, has been adopted to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in most countries. Operating schools safely during the pandemic requires a balance between health risks and the need for in-person learning. We use compartmental models to explore school reopening scenarios.

MethodsUsing demographic and epidemiological data between July 31 and November 23, 2020 from the city of Toronto, we developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Isolated model. Our model with age, household, and community transmission allow us to study the impact of schools open in September 2020. The model mimics the transmission in households, the community, and schools, accounting for differences in infectiousness between adults and children and youth and adults working status. We assessed the extent to which school opening may have contributed to COVID-19 resurgence in the fall and simulated scenarios for the safe reopening of schools up to May 31, 2021. We further considered the impact of the introduction of the new variant of concern.

FindingsThough a slight increase in infections among adults (2.8%) and children (5.4%) is anticipated by the end of the year, safe school opening is possible with stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) decreasing the risk of transmission in the community and the household. We found that while school reopening was not the key driver in virus resurgence, but rather it was community spread that determined the outbreak trajectory, brief school closures did reduce infections when transmission risk within the home was low. When considered possible cross-infection amongst households, communities, and schools, we found that home transmission was crucial for mitigating the epidemic and safely operating schools. Simulating the introduction of a new strain with higher infectiousness, we observed substantial increases in infections, even when both schools and communities are closed.

InterpretationSchools can open safely under strict maintenance of strict public health measures in the community. The gradual opening of schools and communities can only be achieved by maintaining NPIs and mitigating household transmission risk to avoid the broader escape of infections acquired in schools into the community via households. If the new COVID-19 strain is more infectious for children, public spaces, including schools, should be closed, and additional NPIs, including the use of masks, should be extended to toddlers.

Although available studies have assessed the risk of school reopening by modelling the transmission across schools and communities, it remains unclear whether the risk is due to increased transmission in adults or children and youth.We used GoogleScholar and PubMed searches to identify previous published works. We used te following terms: ""school closure"", ""covid 19 school closure"", ""reopening schools"", ""reopening screening school"", ""school household second wave model"". The search of the studies ended in January 2021. Papers in other languages than English and letters were excluded from the search. Two modelling studies examined the effects of screening and delayed school reopening, two other agent-based modelling studies explored the epidemic spread across different age groups.

Added-value of this studyWe find that the resurgence of COVID-19 in Toronto in fall 2020 mainly resulted from the increase of contact rate among adults in the community, and that the degree of in-person attendance had the most significant impact on transmission in schools. To our knowledge, our work is the first to investigate the resurgence in infections following school reopening and the impact of risk mitigation measures in schools operation during the pandemic. Our novel and comprehensive model considers the age and household structure, but also considers three different settings, school, household and community. We further examined the effects of self-screening procedures, class size, and schooling days on transmission, which enabled us to compare scenarios of school reopening separately for both adults and children and youth, and model the cross-infection between them to avoid potential underestimation. We found that after schools opened, reducing household transmission was crucial for mitigating the epidemic since it can reduce cross-infection amongst households, communities and schools. Lastly, given the recent report of SARS-CoV-2 variant (VOC202012/01), we investigated the impact of the new variant that may be more infectious in children and youth.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur analysis can inform policymakers of planning the safe reopening of schools during COVID-19. We suggest that integrating strict NPIs and school control measures are crucial for safe reopening. When schools are open, reducing transmission risk at home and community is paramount in curbing the spread of COVID-19. Lastly, if children are more susceptible to the new COVID-19 VOC, both schools and community must be closed, the time children spend in essential services locations minimized, and NPIs for those aged less than three years enforced.",Pei Yuan; Elena Aruffo; Nicholas ogden; Yi Tan; Evgenia Gatov; Effie Gournis; Sarah Collier; Qi Li; Iain Moyles; Nasri Bouchra; Huaiping Zhu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249753,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249753,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
326,An optimized stepwise algorithm combining rapid antigen and RT-qPCR for screening of COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundDiagnosing SARS CoV-2 infection with certainty is essential for appropriate case management. We investigated the combination of rapid antigen detection (RAD) and RT-qPCR assays in a stepwise procedure to optimize the detection of COVID-19.

MethodsFrom August 2020 to November 2020, 43,399 patients were screened in our laboratory for COVID-19 diagnostic by RT-qPCR using nasopharyngeal swab. Overall, 4,691 of the 43,399 were found to be positive, and 200 were retrieved for RAD testing allowing comparison of diagnostic accuracy between RAD and RT-qPCR. Cycle threshold (Ct) and time from symptoms onset (TSO) were included as covariates.

ResultsThe overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR-, and LR+ of RAD compared with RT- qPCR were 72% (95%CI 62%-81%), 99% (95% CI95%-100%), 99% (95%CI 93%-100%), and 78% (95%CI 70%-85%), 0.28 (95%CI 0.21-0.39), and 72 (95%CI 10-208) respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with Ct [&le;] 25 regardless of TSO: TSO [&le;] 4 days 92% (95%CI 75%-99%), TSO > 4 days 100% (95%CI 54%-100%), and asymptomatic 100% (95%CI 78-100%). Overall, combining RAD and RT-qPCR would allow reducing from only 4% the number of RT-qPCR needed.

ConclusionThis study highlights the risk of misdiagnosing COVID-19 in 28% of patients if RAD is used alone. Thus, negative results from RAD needs to be confirmed by RT-qPCR prior to making treatment decisions. A stepwise analysis that combines RAD and RT-qPCR would be an efficient screening procedure for COVID-19 detection and may facilitate the control of the outbreak.",Philippe HALFON; Guillaume PENARANDA; Hacene KHIRI; Vincent GARCIA; Hortense DROUET; Patrick PHILIBERT; Christina PSOMAS; Marion DELORD; Julie ALLEMAND-SOURRIEU; Frederique RETORNAZ; Caroline CHARPIN; Thomas Gonzales; Herve PEGLIASCO; Jerome ALLARDET-SERVENT,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249254,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249254,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
327,Early Analysis of a potential link between viral load and the N501Y mutation in the SARS-COV-2 spike protein,"A new variant of SARS-CoV-2 has emerged which is increasing in frequency, primarily in the South East of England (lineage B.1.1.7 (1); VUI-202012/01). One potential hypothesis is that infection with the new variant results in higher viral loads, which in turn may make the virus more transmissible. We found higher (sequence derived) viral loads in samples from individuals infected with the new variant with median inferred viral loads were three-fold higher in individuals with the new variant. Most of the new variants were sampled in Kent and Greater London. We observed higher viral loads in Kent compared to Greater London for both the new variant and other circulating lineages. Outside Greater London, the variant has higher viral loads, whereas within Greater London, the new variant does not have significantly higher viral loads compared to other circulating lineages. Higher variant viral loads outside Greater London could be due to demographic effects, such as a faster variant growth rate compared to other lineages or concentration in particular age-groups. However, our analysis does not exclude a causal link between infection with the new variant and higher viral loads. This is a preliminary analysis and further work is needed to investigate any potential causal link between infection with this new variant and higher viral loads, and whether this results in higher transmissibility, severity of infection, or affects relative rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection

328,Bacterial superinfection pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure,"BackgroundSevere community-acquired pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 is a leading cause of death. Current guidelines recommend patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia receive empirical antibiotic therapy for suspected bacterial superinfection, but little evidence supports these recommendations.

MethodsWe obtained bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. We analyzed BAL samples with multiplex PCR and quantitative culture to determine the prevalence of superinfecting pathogens at the time of intubation and identify episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) over the course of mechanical ventilation. We compared antibiotic use with guideline-recommended care.

ResultsThe 179 ventilated patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia discharged from our hospital by June 30, 2020 were analyzed. 162 (90.5%) patients had at least one BAL procedure; 133 (74.3%) within 48 hours after intubation and 112 (62.6%) had at least one subsequent BAL during their hospitalization. A superinfecting pathogen was identified within 48 hours of intubation in 28/133 (21%) patients, most commonly methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species (21/28, 75%). BAL-based treatment reduced antibiotic use compared with guideline-recommended care. 72 patients (44.4%) developed at least one VAP episode. Only 15/72 (20.8%) of initial VAPs were attributable to multidrug-resistant pathogens. The incidence rate of VAP was 45.2/1000 ventilator days.

ConclusionsWith use of sensitive diagnostic tools, bacterial superinfection at the time of intubation is infrequent in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Treatment based on current guidelines would result in substantial antibiotic overuse. The incidence rate of VAP in ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are higher than historically reported.",Chiagozie O. Pickens; Catherine A. Gao; Michael J. Cuttica; Sean B.

329,Increased peripheral blood neutrophil activation phenotypes and NETosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundIncreased inflammation is a hallmark of COVID-19, with pulmonary and systemic inflammation identified in multiple cohorts of patients. Definitive cellular and molecular pathways driving severe forms of this disease remain uncertain. Neutrophils, the most numerous leukocytes in blood circulation, can contribute to immunopathology in infections, inflammatory diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Changes in multiple neutrophil functions and circulating cytokine levels over time during COVID-19 may help define disease severity and guide care and decision making.

MethodsBlood was obtained serially from critically ill COVID-19 patients for 11 days. Neutrophil oxidative burst, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), phagocytosis and cytokine levels were assessed ex vivo. Lung tissue was obtained immediately post-mortem for immunostaining.

ResultsElevations in neutrophil-associated cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, and general inflammatory cytokines IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10 and TNF, were identified in COVID-19 plasma both at the first measurement and at multiple timepoints across hospitalization (p < 0.0001). Neutrophils had exaggerated oxidative burst (p < 0.0001), NETosis (p < 0.0001) and phagocytosis (p < 0.0001) relative to controls. Increased NETosis correlated with both leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Neutrophils and NETs were identified within airways and alveoli in the lung parenchyma of 40% of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs. While elevations in IL-8 and ANC correlated to COVID-19 disease severity, plasma IL-8 levels alone correlated with death.

ConclusionsCirculating neutrophils in COVID-19 exhibit an activated phenotype with increased oxidative burst, NETosis and phagocytosis. Readily accessible and dynamic, plasma IL-8 and circulating neutrophil function may be potential COVID-19 disease biomarkers.",Jorge A. Masso-Silva PhD; Alexander Moshensky BS; Michael T. Y.

330,Elevated Angiopoietin-2 inhibits thrombomodulin-mediated anticoagulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Several studies suggest that hypercoagulation and endothelial dysfunction play central roles in severe forms of COVID-19. Here, we hypothesized that the high levels of the inflammatory cytokine Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) reported in hospitalized COVID-19 patients might promote hypercoagulation through ANGPT2 binding to thrombomodulin with resulting inhibition of thrombin/thrombomodulin-mediated physiological anticoagulation. We therefore investigated plasma samples taken at two timepoints from 20 critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care regarding ANGPT2 levels and coagulation markers in comparison with 20 healthy blood donors. We found that ANGPT2 levels were increased in the COVID-19 patients in correlation with disease severity, hypercoagulation, and mortality. To test causality, we administered ANGPT2 to wildtype mice and found that it shortened bleeding time in a tail injury model. In further support of a role for ANGPT2 in physiological coagulation, bleeding time was increased in endothelial-specific Angpt2 knockout mice. Using in vitro assays, we found that ANGPT2 inhibited thrombomodulin-mediated anticoagulation and protein C activation in human donor plasma. Our data reveal a novel mechanism for ANGPT2 in hypercoagulation and suggest that Angiopoietin-2 inhibition may be tested in the treatment of hypercoagulation in severe COVID-19, as well as in certain other conditions, including sepsis.",Michael Hultstrom; Karin Fromell; Anders Larsson; Susan E Quaggin; Christer Betsholtz; Robert Frithiof; Miklos Lipcsey; Marie Jeansson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249429,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249429,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
331,The impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on those with lifelong conditions: a case study of congenital heart disease,"ObjectivesGlobally, health care systems have been stretched to the limit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant changes have had to be made to the way in which non-COVID-19 related care has been delivered. Our objective was to understand, from the perspective of patients with a chronic, life-long condition (congenital heart disease, CHD) and their parents/carers, the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of care, how changes were communicated and whether health care providers should do anything differently in a subsequent wave of COVID-19 infections.

Design and settingA series of asynchronous discussion forums set up and moderated by three patient charities via their Facebook pages.

ParticipantsPatients with CHD and parents/carers of patients with CHD.

Main outcome measuresQualitative responses to questions posted on the discussion forums.

ResultsThe forums ran over a 6-week period and involved 111 participants. Following thematic analysis of the transcripts, we identified three themes and ten subthemes related to individual condition-related factors, patient-related factors and health professional/centre factors that may have influenced how patients and parents/carers experienced changes to service delivery as a result of COVID-19.

ConclusionsOur findings, whilst collected in relation to patients with CHD, are not necessarily specific to this population and we believe reflect the experiences of many thousands of people with life-long conditions in the UK. Drawing on what participants told us in the discussion forums, we have developed recommendations related to communication, service delivery and support during the pandemic that would, we think, improve patients experience of care and, potentially, their outcomes. Although the data were collected specifically in relation to COVID-19, a number of these recommendations are relevant to the wider delivery of care to patients with chronic underlying health conditions and reflect principles of good communication and service delivery.",Jo Wray; Christina Pagel; Adrian H Chester; Fiona Kennedy; Sonya Crowe,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249447,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249447,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
332,Mortality of Diabetes-related Acute Metabolic Emergencies in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"PurposeLittle is known on the mortality rate in COVID-19 related acute metabolic emergencies, namely diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), combined DKA/HHS, and euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA).

MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted using EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar from January 1, 2020 to January 9, 2021 to identify all case report series, cross-sectional studies, and meta-analyses of case reports describing mortality rate in DKA, HHS, and EDKA, in COVID-19 patients. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for case reports was used for quality assessment.

ResultsFrom 313 identified publications, 4 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. A systematic review and meta-analysis with subgroup analyses examined mortality rate in a total of 152 COVID-19 patients who had developed DKA, HHS, combined DKA/HHS, or EDKA. Combined mortality rate and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using random effects model. The study was registered to PROSPERO database (ID: 230737).

ResultsCombined mortality rate was found to be 27.1% [95% CI: 11.2-46.9%]. Heterogeneity was considerable (I2=83%; 95% CI: 56-93%), corrected to 67% according to Von Hippel adjustment for small meta-analyses. Funnel plot presented no apparent asymmetry; Eggers and Beggs test yielded in P=0.44 and P=0.50, respectively. Sensitivity analysis failed to explain heterogeneity.

ConclusionCOVID-19 related acute metabolic emergencies (DKA, HHS, and EDKA) are characterized by considerable mortality; thus, clinicians should be aware of timely detection and immediate treatment commencing.",Vasileios Periklis Papadopoulos; Peny Avramidou; Stefania-Aspasia Bakola; Dimitra-Georgia Zikoudi; Ntilara Touzlatzi; Marios-Vasileios Koutroulos; Dimitrios K Filippou,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249697,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249697,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
333,"Epidemiology of the early COVID-19 epidemic in Orange County, California: comparison of predictors of test positivity, mortality, and seropositivity","COVID-19 is one of the largest public health emergencies in modern history. Here we present a detailed analysis from a large population center in Southern California (Orange County, population of 3.2 million) to understand heterogeneity in risks of infection, test positivity, and death. We used a combination of datasets, including a population-representative seroprevalence survey, to assess the true burden of disease as well as COVID-19 testing intensity, test positivity, and mortality. In the first month of the local epidemic, case incidence clustered in high income areas. This pattern quickly shifted, with cases next clustering in much higher rates in the north-central area which has a lower socio-economic status. Since April, a concentration of reported cases, test positivity, testing intensity, and seropositivity in a north-central area persisted. At the individual level, several factors (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, zip codes with low educational attainment) strongly affected risk of seropositivity and death.",Daniel M.

334,Evaluating the effects of re-opening plans on dynamics of COVID-19 in SP,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in early March 2020. In Brazil, Sao Paulo is the most affected state, comprising about 20% of the countrys cases. With no vaccine available to date, distancing measures have been taken to reduce virus transmission. To reduce the pandemics effect on the economy, the government of Sao Paulo has proposed a plan consisting of five phases of the gradual re-opening of activities. In this context, we have developed a mathematical model to simulate the gradual re-opening plan on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, in the city of Sao Paulo. The model shows that a precipitous reopening can cause a higher peak of the disease, which may compromise the local health system. Waiting for the reduction in the incidence of infected individuals for at least 15 days to phase transition is the most efficient strategy compared to the fixed-period scenario at each phase of the re-opening plan.",Felipe Alves Rubio; Thomas Nogueira Vilches,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249809,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249809,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True
335,Impact of COVID-19 on Care-Home Mortality and Life Expectancy in Scotland,"IntroductionCOVID-19 deaths are commoner among care-home residents, but the mortality burden has not been quantified.

MethodsCare-home residency was identified via a national primary care registration database linked to national mortality data. Life expectancy was estimated using Makeham-Gompertz models, to (i) describe yearly life expectancy from Nov 2015 to Oct 2020 (ii) compare life expectancy (during 2016-2018) between care-home residents and the wider Scottish population and (iii) apply care-home life expectancy estimates to COVID-19 death counts to estimate years of life lost (YLL).

ResultsAmong care-home residents, life expectancy in 2015/16 to 2019/20 ranged from 2.7 to 2.3 years for women and 2.3 to 1.8 years for men. Life expectancy was lowest in 2019/20. Age-sex specific life expectancy in 2016-2018 in care-home residents was lower than in the Scottish population (10 and 2.5 years in those aged 70 and 90 respectively). Rather than using national life tables, applying care-home specific life expectancies to COVID-19 deaths yields, mean YLLs for care-home residents were 2.6 and 2.2 for women and men respectively, with total care-home resident YLLs of 3,560 years in women and 2,046 years in men. In people aged over-70, approximately half of deaths and a quarter of YLL attributed to COVID-19 were accounted for by the 5% of over-70s who were care-home residents.

ConclusionPrioritising care-home residents for vaccination is justified not only in terms of total deaths, but also in terms of years of life lost.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed to 1st December 2020, with the terms (""nursing home"" OR ""care-home"" OR ""long-term care"" OR ""residential care"") AND (""mortality"" OR ""life expectancy"" OR ""length of stay""). We also searched for studies specific to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those living in care-homes. We restricted our search to publications in English. Usual care-home life expectancy, in a UK context, has not previously been defined. One systematic review of length of stay was identified, which found significant heterogeneity in factors and associations. The impact of COVID-19 on excess mortality among care-home residents was noted, but the impact on life expectancy was not reported. Studies evaluating life expectancy among older people in the COVID-19 pandemic have not taken account of residency in their estimates.

Added value of this studyUsing Scottish national representative linked data we describe the usual life expectancy of older adults (aged [&ge;]70 years) living in care-homes, compared to older people living elsewhere. Deaths among care-home residents account for a considerable proportion of all mortality in older adults, around 19% for men and 30% for women. Life expectancy in care-home residents during the pandemic fell by almost 6 months, from 2.7 to 2.3 years in men and 2.1 to 1.8 years in women. In total, over 5,600 Years of Life were Lost (YLL) by care-home residents in Scotland who died with COVID-19. Around half of COVID-19 deaths and a quarter of YLL in those aged 70 years and over occurred among care-home residents. During the COVID-19 pandemic a smaller proportion of deaths among care-home residents occurred in hospitals.

Implications of all the available evidencePrioritising the 5% of older adults who are care-home residents for vaccination against COVID-19 is justified both in terms of total deaths and total years of life lost. Individual and societal planning for care needs in older age relies on understanding usual care-home life expectancy and patterns of mortality. Understanding life expectancy may help clinicians, residents and their families make decisions about their health care, facilitating more informed discussions around their priorities and wishes. Population-wide estimates of YLL and burden of disease should take account of residency status, given the significant differences between life expectancy of those living in care-homes from their peers in other settings.",Jennifer Kirsty Burton; Martin Reid; Ciara Gribben; David Caldwell; David N Clark; Peter Hanlon; Terence J Quinn; Colin Fischbacher; Peter Knight; Bruce Guthrie; David McAllister,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249871,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.15.21249871,2021-01-15,2021-01-15,,True

338,"Modeling the COVID-19 transmission in Italy: The roles of asymptomatic cases, social distancing, and lockdowns","The SEIR model of COVID-19 is developed based on the system dynamics approach. Compared with existing models, the model successfully reproduces similar multiple observed outputs such as infected and recovered patients in Italy by July 2020. In doing so, the system dynamics model captures the roles of undocumented cases on the Italian COVID-19 flow. The model also considers two types of measures including behavioral measures and lockdown measures as they are embedded in the model. It is hoped that the model can enhance our understanding of the roles of undocumented cases, so-called asymptomatic cases, and the efficacy of two different policies on the COVID-19 flow. This study concludes that the first policy is important once the number of infected cases is relatively low. However, once the number of infected cases is very high so the society cannot identify infected and disinfected people, the second policy must be applied soon. It is thus this study suggests that relaxed lockdowns lead the second wave of the COVID-19 around the world.",Muhamad Khairulbahri,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249273,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249273,2021-01-14,2021-01-14,,True
339,"Magnitude, change over time, demographic characteristics and geographic distribution of excess deaths among nursing home residents during the first wave of COVID-19 in France: a nationwide cohort study","ImportanceNursing home (NH) residents are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lethality. However, excess deaths in this population have rarely been documented.

ObjectivesThe primary objective was to assess the number of excess deaths among NH residents during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. The secondary objectives were to determine the number of excess deaths as a proportion of the total excess deaths in the general population and determine whether a harvesting effect was present.

DesignWe studied a cohort of 494,753 adults (as of March 1st, 2020) aged 60 and over in 6,515 NHs in mainland France. This cohort was exposed to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 1st to May 31st, 2020) and was compared with the corresponding, reference cohorts from 2014 to 2019 (using data from the French National Health Data System).

Main outcome and measuresThe main outcome was all-cause death. Weekly excess deaths and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated.

ResultThere were 13,505 excess deaths among NH residents. Mortality increased by 43% (SMR: 1.43). The mortality excess was higher among males than among females (SMR: 1.51 and 1.38, respectively) and decreased with age (SMRs in females: 1.61 in the 60-74 age group, 1.58 for 75-84, 1.41 for 85-94, and 1.31 for 95 or over; Males: SMRs: 1.59 for 60-74, 1.69 for 75-84, 1.47 for 85-94, and 1.41 for 95 or over). We did not observe a harvesting effect (up until August 30th, 2020). By extrapolating to all NH residents nationally (N=570,003), the latter accounted for 51% of the total excess deaths in the general population (N=15,114 out of 29,563).

ConclusionNH residents accounted for about half of the total excess deaths in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The excess death rate was higher among males than females and among younger residents than among older residents. We did not observe a harvesting effect. A real-time mortality surveillance system and the identification of individual and environmental risk factors might help to design the future model of care for older dependent adults.

340,Occupational and environmental exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in and around infected mink farms,"Unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 infections in farmed minks raised immediate concerns regarding human health which initiated intensive environmental investigations. Air sampling was performed in infected mink farms, at farm premises and at residential sites. A range of other environmental samples were collected from minks housing units including bedding material. Inside the farms, high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found in airborne dust, on surfaces, and on various other environmental matrices. This warns for occupational exposure which was substantiated by considerable SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in personal air samples. Dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 to outdoor air was found to be limited and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in air samples collected beyond farm premises, implying a negligible environmental exposure risk for nearby communities. Our occupational and environmental risk assessment is in line with whole genome sequences analyses showing mink-to-human transmission in farm workers, but no indications for direct zoonotic transmission events to nearby communities.",Myrna M.T. de Rooij; Renate Hakze-Van der Honing; Marcel Hulst; Frank Harders; Marc Engelsma; Wouter van de Hoef; Kees Meliefste; Sigrid Nieuwenweg; Bas Oude Munnink; Isabella van Schothorst; Reina Sikkema; Arco van der Spek; Marcel Spierenburg; Jack Spithoven; Ruth Bouwstra; Robert-Jan Molenaar; Marion Koopmans; Arjan Stegeman; Wim H.M.

341,N-terminal domain antigenic mapping reveals a site of vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is orchestrated by the spike (S) glycoprotein that contains an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeted by the largest fraction of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in COVID-19 patient plasma. Little is known about neutralizing Abs binding to epitopes outside the RBD and their contribution to protection. Here, we describe 41 human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) derived from memory B cells, which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal domain (NTD) and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently. We define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate effector functions, and protect Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the 501Y.V2 and B.1.1.7 lineages, harbor frequent mutations localized in the NTD supersite suggesting ongoing selective pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs to protective immunity.",Matthew McCallum; Anna De Marco; Florian Lempp; M.

342,"A highly thermotolerant, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain derivative elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies","The Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We fused our previously described, highly thermotolerant glycan engineered monomeric RBD to a heterologous non-immunogenic trimerization domain derived from cartilage matrix protein. The protein was expressed at a good yield of [~]80-100 mg/liter in Expi293 cells, as well as in both CHO and HEK293 stable cell lines. The designed trimeric RBD was observed to form homogeneous disulfide-linked trimers. When lyophilized, the trimer possessed remarkable functional stability to transient thermal stress of upto 100 {degrees}C and was stable to long term storage of over 4 weeks at 37 {degrees}C. Two immunizations with an AddaVax adjuvanted formulation elicited antibodies with high endpoint neutralizing titers against replicative virus with geometric mean titers of [~]1114 and 1940 in guinea pigs and mice respectively. In pseudoviral assays, corresponding titers were [~]3600 and [~]16050, while the corresponding value for human convalescent sera was 137. Similar results were obtained with an Alhydrogel, CpG combination adjuvant. The same immunogen was expressed in Pichia pastoris, but this formed high molecular weight aggregates and elicited much lower ACE2 competing antibodies than mammalian cell expressed protein. The excellent thermotolerance, high yield, and robust immunogenicity of such trimeric RBD immunogens suggest that they are a promising modality to combat COVID-19.

ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The viral surface exposed Spike glycoprotein is the target of neutralizing antibodies of which a major fraction targets the receptor binding domain (RBD). Thus RBD derived immunogens are attractive vaccine candidates. Monomeric, mammalian cell expressed RBD protein elicits low to moderate titers of neutralizing antibodies. We designed a highly expressed, trimeric RBD derivative with a non-immunogenic trimerization domain. In guinea pigs and mice respectively, this derivative induces 20-300 fold higher neutralizing antibody titers relative to convalescent human sera, while remaining conformationally intact after incubation for over four weeks at 37 {degrees}C and for ninety minutes at 100 {degrees}C when lyophilized. Such trimeric RBD formulations should not require a cold chain. Additionally, the high titers of neutralizing antibodies should buffer against viral sequence variation.

343,Susceptibility of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to SARS-CoV-2,"The origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing the global coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains a mystery. Current evidence suggests a likely spillover into humans from an animal reservoir. Understanding the host range and identifying animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to elucidate the origin of the virus and the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Here we demonstrated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an animal species in which the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - the SARS-CoV-2 receptor - shares a high degree of similarity to humans, are highly susceptible to infection. Intranasal inoculation of deer fawns with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in established subclinical viral infection and shedding of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Notably, infected animals transmitted the virus to non-inoculated contact deer. Viral RNA was detected in multiple tissues 21 days post-inoculation (pi). All inoculated and indirect contact animals seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies as early as day 7 pi. The work provides important insights into the animal host range of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies white-tailed deer as a susceptible wild animal species to the virus.

IMPORTANCEGiven the presumed zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, the human-animal-environment interface of COVID-19 pandemic is an area of great scientific and public- and animal-health interest. Identification of animal species that are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate the potential origin of the virus, identify potential reservoirs or intermediate hosts, and define the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Additionally, it may also provide information and help to prevent potential reverse zoonosis that could lead to the establishment of a new wildlife hosts. Our data show that upon intranasal inoculation, white-tailed deer became subclinically infected and shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and feces. Importantly, indirect contact animals were infected and shed infectious virus, indicating efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission from inoculated animals. These findings support the inclusion of wild cervid species in investigations conducted to assess potential reservoirs or sources of SARS-CoV-2 of infection.",Mitchell V Palmer; Mathias Martins; Shollie Falkenberg; Alexandra C Buckley; Leonardo C Caserta; Patrick K.

344,"The lethal triad: SARS-CoV-2 Spike, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Mutations in host and pathogen may affect the course of pandemic.","Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified rapidly after the beginning of pandemic. One of them, involving the spike protein and called D614G, represents a substantial percentage of currently isolated strains. While research on this variant was ongoing worldwide, on December 20th 2020 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported a Threat Assessment Brief describing the emergence of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, named B.1.1.7, harboring multiple mutations mostly affecting the Spike protein. This viral variant has been recently associated with a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in South East England, with alarming implications for future virus transmission rates. Specifically, of the nine amino acid replacements that characterize the Spike in the emerging variant, four are found in the region between the Fusion Peptide and the RBD domain (namely the already known D614G, together with A570D, P681H, T716I), and one, N501Y, is found in the Spike Receptor Binding Domain - Receptor Binding Motif (RBD-RBM). In this study, by using in silico biology, we provide evidence that these amino acid replacements have dramatic effects on the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 Spike and the host ACE2 receptor or TMPRSS2, the protease that induces the fusogenic activity of Spike. Mostly, we show that these effects are strongly dependent on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphism, suggesting that dynamics of pandemics are strongly influenced not only by virus variation but also by host genetic background.",Matteo Calcagnile; Patricia Forgez; Pietro Alifano; Marco Alifano,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426365,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426365,2021-01-14,2021-01-14,,False
345,Surveillance of genetic diversity and evolution in locally transmitted SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Surveillance of genetic diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important to detect the emergence of more infectious and deadly strains of the virus. In this study, we monitored mutational events in the SARS-CoV-2 genome through whole genome sequencing. The samples (n=48) were collected from the hot spot regions of the metropolitan city Karachi, Pakistan during the four months (May 2020 to August 2020) of first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data analysis highlighted 122 mutations, including 120 single nucleotide variations (SNV), and 2 deletions. Among the 122 mutations, there were 71 singletons, and 51 recurrent mutations. A total of 16 mutations, including 5 nonsynonymous mutations, were detected in spike protein. Notably, the spike protein missense mutation D614G was observed in 31 genomes. The phylogenetic analysis revealed majority of the genomes (36) classified as B lineage, where 2 genomes were from B.6 lineage, 5 genomes from B.1 ancestral lineage and remaining from B.1 sub-lineages. It was noteworthy that three clusters of B.1 sub-lineages were observed, including B.1.36 lineage (10 genomes), B.1.160 lineage (11 genomes), and B.1.255 lineage (5 genomes), which represent independent events of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the city. The sub-lineage B.1.36 had higher representation from the Asian countries and the UK, B.1.160 correspond to the European countries with highest representation from the UK, Denmark, and lesser representation from India, Saudi Arabia, France and Switzerland, and the third sub-lineage (B.1.255) correspond to the USA.

Plasmid DNA vaccines are one of the most remarkable vaccines that can be developed in a short term. pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co, which is a plasmid DNA vaccine, was designed to express severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The produced antibodies lead to Immunoreactions against S protein, anti-receptor-binding-domain, and neutralizing action of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co, as confirmed in a previous study. To promote the efficacy of the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine, a pyro-drive jet injector (PJI) was employed. PJI is an injection device that can adjust the injection pressure depending on various target tissues. Intradermally-adjusted PJI demonstrated that pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine injection caused a strong production of anti-S protein antibodies, triggered immunoreactions and neutralizing actions against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, a high dose of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection via PJI did not cause any serious disorders in the rat model. Finally, virus infection challenge in mice, confirmed that intradermally immunized (via PJI) mice were potently protected from COVID-19 infection. Thus, pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection via PJI is a safe and promising vaccination method to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.",Tomoyuki Nishikawa; Chin Yang Chang; Jiayu A Tai; Hiroki Hayashi; Jiao Sun; Shiho Torii; Chikako Ono; Yoshiharu Matsuura; Ryoko Ide; Junichi Mineno; Miwa Sasai; Masahiro Yamamoto; Hironori Nakagami; Kunihiko Yamashita,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426436,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426436,2021-01-14,2021-01-14,,False
347,Impacts of 203/204: RG>KR mutation in the N protein of SARS-CoV-2,"We present a structure-based model of phosphorylation-dependent binding and sequestration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the impact of two consecutive amino acid changes R203K and G204R. Additionally, we studied how mutant strains affect HLA-specific antigen presentation and correlated these findings with HLA allelic population frequencies. We discovered RG>KR mutated SARS-CoV-2 expands the ability for differential expression of the N protein epitope on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC) of varying Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) origin. The N protein LKR region K203, R204 of wild type (SARS-CoVs) and (SARS-CoV-2) observed HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:21, but mutant SARS-CoV-2 observed HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-A*68:01.

348,Mutation rates and selection on synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented response from the sequencing community. Leveraging the sequence data from more than 140,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we study mutation rates and selective pressures affecting the virus. Understanding the processes and effects of mutation and selection has profound implications for the study of viral evolution, for vaccine design, and for the tracking of viral spread. We highlight and address some common genome sequence analysis pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate inference of mutation rates and selection, such as ignoring skews in the genetic code, not accounting for recurrent mutations, and assuming evolutionary equilibrium. We find that two particular mutation rates, G[-&gt;]U and C[-&gt;]U, are similarly elevated and considerably higher than all other mutation rates, causing the majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and are possibly the result of APOBEC and ROS activity. These mutations also tend to occur many times at the same genome positions along the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (i.e., they are very homoplasic). We observe an effect of genomic context on mutation rates, but the effect of the context is overall limited. While previous studies have suggested selection acting to decrease U content at synonymous sites, we bring forward evidence suggesting the opposite.",Nicola De Maio; Conor R Walker; Yatish Turakhia; Robert Lanfear; Russell Corbett-Detig; Nick Goldman,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426705,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.426705,2021-01-14,2021-01-14,,False
349,SARS-CoV-2 spike protein arrested in the closed state induces potent neutralizing responses,"The majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in use or in advanced clinical development are based on the viral spike protein (S) as their immunogen. S is present on virions as pre-fusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described that act against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies will depend upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving, circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, while avoiding the risk of antibody dependent enhancement as observed with other Coronavirus vaccines. Here we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer that is arrested in the closed state to prevent exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with the receptor. We compared this with a range of other modified S protein constructs, including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induce a long-lived, strongly neutralizing antibody response as well as T-cell responses. Notably, the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralising responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different, but equally potent, virus-inhibiting immune responses than open spikes, and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Together with their improved stability and storage properties we suggest that closed spikes may be a valuable component of refined, next-generation vaccines.",George W Carnell; Katarzyna A Ciazynska; David A Wells; Xiaoli Xiong; Ernest T Aguinam; Stephen H McLaughlin; Donna Mallery; Leo C James; Jonathan Luke Heeney; John A.

350,The National COVID Cohort Collaborative: Clinical Characterization and Early Severity Prediction,"BackgroundThe majority of U.S. reports of COVID-19 clinical characteristics, disease course, and treatments are from single health systems or focused on one domain. Here we report the creation of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a centralized, harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record repository that is the largest, most representative U.S. cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls to date. This multi-center dataset supports robust evidence-based development of predictive and diagnostic tools and informs critical care and policy.

Methods and FindingsIn a retrospective cohort study of 1,926,526 patients from 34 medical centers nationwide, we stratified patients using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographics; we then evaluated differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression. We established vital signs and laboratory values among COVID-19 patients with different severities, providing the foundation for predictive analytics. The cohort included 174,568 adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PCR >99% or antigen <1%) as well as 1,133,848 adult patients that served as lab-negative controls. Among 32,472 hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March/April 2020 to 8.6% in September/October 2020 (p = 0.002 monthly trend). In a multivariable logistic regression model, age, male sex, liver disease, dementia, African-American and Asian race, and obesity were independently associated with higher clinical severity. To demonstrate the utility of the N3C cohort for analytics, we used machine learning (ML) to predict clinical severity and risk factors over time. Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, we predicted a severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) using random forest and XGBoost models (AUROC 0.86 and 0.87 respectively) that were stable over time. The most powerful predictors in these models are patient age and widely available vital sign and laboratory values. The established expected trajectories for many vital signs and laboratory values among patients with different clinical severities validates observations from smaller studies, and provides comprehensive insight into COVID-19 characterization in U.S. patients.

ConclusionsThis is the first description of an ongoing longitudinal observational study of patients seen in diverse clinical settings and geographical regions and is the largest COVID-19 cohort in the United States. Such data are the foundation for ML models that can be the basis for generalizable clinical decision support tools. The N3C Data Enclave is unique in providing transparent, reproducible, easily shared, versioned, and fully auditable data and analytic provenance for national-scale patient-level EHR data. The N3C is built for intensive ML analyses by academic, industry, and citizen scientists internationally.

Serum from patients of varying ages and clinical severity were collected and used to probe a novel multi-coronavirus protein microarray containing SARS-CoV-2 proteins and overlapping protein fragments of varying length as well as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 proteins. IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses to specific epitopes within the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane proteins (M) were higher in older adult patients. Moreover, the older age group displayed more consistent correlations of antibody reactivity with systemic cytokine and chemokine responses when compared to the younger adult group. A subset of patients, however, had little or no response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and disproportionately severe clinical outcomes.

352,The Relationship between Democracy embracement and COVID-19 reported casualties worldwide,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 toll of cases and deaths followed an uneven pattern across the world. The literature has partly explained the observed discrepancy between the different countries by country-specific and systemic patterns worldwide. In this study, we propose an additional explanation that the magnitude of COVID-19 toll reported to the WHO could be influenced by the level of free speech and Democracy in the reporting countries.

MethodsWe constructed a longitudinal dataset including the daily COVID-19 count of cases and deaths worldwide and each countrys respective score on the Freedom in the World index. We applied two Generalized Estimating Equation models to investigate if a countrys reported toll count of COVID-19 cases and deaths is related to that countrys freedom level. We controlled for factors identified in the current literature to affect the pandemics spread.

ResultsA countrys score on the Freedom In the World Index was associated with its reported COVID-19 cases count (57028.43, 95% CI 985.3619 - 113071.5, P= 0.0461) and deaths count (3473.273, 95% CI1217.12-5729.42, P=.002). Also, despite having almost equal shares of the worlds population, countries at the bottom category of the Freedom index reported 21% and 11% of the COVID-19 toll cases and death counts reported by countries of highest scores on the index, respectively.

Integrating theoretical results with clinical COVID-19 patients data, we classified the COVID-19 development processes into three typical modes of immune responses, correlated with the clinical classification of mild & moderate, severe and critical patients. We found that the immune efficacy (the ability of host to clear virus and kill infected cells) and the lymphocyte supply (the abundance and pool of naive T and B cell) play important roles in the dynamic process and determine the clinical outcome, especially for the severe and critical patients. Furthermore, we put forward possible treatment strategies for the three typical modes of immune response. We hope our results can help to understand the dynamical mechanism of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to be useful for the treatment strategies and vaccine design.",Zhengqing Zhou; Ziheng Zhao; Shuyu Shi; Jianghua Wu; Dianjie Li; Jianwei Li; Jingpeng Zhang; Ke Gui; Yu Zhang; Heng Mei; Yu Hu; Qi Ouyang; Fangting Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249562,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249562,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
354,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen from serum can aid in timing of COVID-19 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in respiratory samples for weeks or even months after onset of COVID-19 disease. Therefore, one of the diagnostic challenges of PCR positive cases is differentiating between acute COVID-19 disease and convalescent phase. Recently, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen in serum samples of COVID-19 patients was published [Le Hingrat et al. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen in blood during acute COVID-19 provides a sensitive new marker and new testing alternatives, Clinical Microbiology and Infection, 2020].

Our study aimed to characterize the analytical specificity and sensitivity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Salocor SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Quantitative Assay Kit(C) (Salofa Ltd, Salo, Finland)) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in serum, and to characterize the kinetics of antigenemia. The evaluation material included a negative serum panel of 155 samples, and 126 serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19.

The specificity of the Salocor SARS-CoV-2 serum N antigen test was 98.0%. In comparison with simultaneous positive PCR from upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens, the test sensitivity was 91.7%. In a serum panel in which the earliest serum sample was collected two days before the collection of positive URT specimen, and the latest 48 days after (median 1 day post URT sample collection), the serum N antigen test sensitivity was 94% within 14 days post onset of symptoms. The antigenemia resolved approximately two weeks after the onset of disease and diagnostic PCR.

The combination of simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody testing appeared to provide useful information for the timing of COVID-19. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 N-antigenemia may be used as a diagnostic marker in acute COVID-19.",Maarit J Ahava; Satu Kurkela; Suvi Kuivanen; Maija Lappalainen; Hanna Jarva; Anne J Jaaskelainen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20248771,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20248771,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
355,A national retrospective cohort study of mechanical ventilator availability and its association with mortality risk in intensive care patients with COVID-19,"ObjectivesTo determine if there is an association between survival rates in intensive care units (ICU) and occupancy of the unit on the day of admission.

DesignNational retrospective observational cohort study spanning the first wave of the Englands COVID-19 pandemic.

Setting114 hospital trusts (groups of hospitals functioning as single operational units).

Participants4,032 adults admitted to an ICU in England between 2nd April and 1st June, 2020, with presumed or confirmed COVID-19, for whom data was submitted to the national surveillance programme and met study inclusion criteria.

InterventionsN/A

Main Outcomes and MeasuresA Bayesian hierarchical approach was used to model the association between hospital trust level (mechanical ventilation compatible) bed occupancy, and in-hospital all-cause mortality. Results were adjusted for unit characteristics (pre-pandemic size), individual patient-level demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, time-to-ICU admission), and recorded chronic comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, respiratory disease, liver disease, heart disease, hypertension, immunosuppression, neurological disease, renal disease).

Results79,793 patient-days were observed, with a mortality rate of 19.4 per 1,000 patient days. Adjusting for patient-level factors, mortality was higher for admissions during periods of high occupancy (>85% occupancy versus the baseline of 45 to 85%) [OR 1.19 (95% posterior credible interval (PCI): 1.00 to 1.44)]. In contrast, mortality was decreased for admissions during periods of low occupancy (<45% relative to the baseline) [OR 0.75 (95% PCI: 0.62 to 0.89)].

Conclusion and RelevanceIncreasing occupancy of beds compatible with mechanical ventilation, a proxy for operational strain, is associated with a higher mortality risk for individuals admitted to ICU. Public health interventions (such as expeditious vaccination programmes and non-pharmaceutical interventions) to control both incidence and prevalence of COVID-19, and therefore keep ICU occupancy low in the context of the pandemic, are necessary to mitigate the impact of this type of resource saturation.

O_TEXTBOXSummary Box

What is already known on this topicPre-pandemic, higher occupancy of intensive care units was shown to be associated with increased mortality risk. However, there is limited data on the extent to which occupancy levels impacted patient outcomes during the first wave of COVID-19, especially in light of the mobilisation of significant additional resources. A recent study from Belgium reported a 42% higher mortality during periods of ICU surge capacity deployment, although in the analysis surge capacity was evaluated only as a binary variable. Although, this contradicts earlier results from smaller studies in Australia and Wales, where no association between ICU occupancy and mortality was identified.

What this study addsThe results of this study suggest that survival rates for patients with COVID-19 in intensive care settings appears to deteriorate as the occupancy of (surge capacity) beds compatible with mechanical ventilation (a proxy for operational pressure), increases. Moreover, this risk doesnt occur above a specific threshold, but rather appears linear; whereby going from 0% occupancy to 100% occupancy increases risk of mortality by 92% (after adjusting for relevant individual-level factors). Furthermore, risk of mortality based on occupancy on the date of recorded outcome is even higher; OR 4.74 (95% posterior credible interval: 3.54 - 6.34). As such, this national-level cohort study of England provides compelling evidence for a relationship between occupancy and critical care mortality, and highlights the needs for decisive action to control the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19.

356,Deep RNA Sequencing of Intensive Care Unit Patients with COVID-19,"PurposeCOVID-19 has impacted millions of patients across the world. Molecular testing occurring now identifies the presence of the virus at the sampling site: nasopharynx, nares, or oral cavity. RNA sequencing has the potential to establish both the presence of the virus and define the hosts response in COVID-19.

MethodsSingle center, prospective study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit where deep RNA sequencing (>100 million reads) of peripheral blood with computational biology analysis was done. All patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Clinical data was prospectively collected.

ResultsWe enrolled fifteen patients at a single hospital. Patients were critically ill with a mortality of 47% and 67% were on a ventilator. All the patients had the SARS-CoV-2 RNA identified in the blood in addition to RNA from other viruses, bacteria, and archaea. The expression of many immune modulating genes, including PD-L1 and PD-L2, were significantly different in patients who died from COVID-19. Some proteins were influenced by alternative transcription and splicing events, as seen in HLA-C, HLA-E, NRP1 and NRP2. Entropy calculated from alternative RNA splicing and transcription start/end predicted mortality in these patients.

ConclusionsCurrent upper respiratory tract testing for COVID-19 only determines if the virus is present. Deep RNA sequencing with appropriate computational biology may provide important prognostic information and point to therapeutic foci to be precisely targeted in future studies.

Take Home MessageDeep RNA sequencing provides a novel diagnostic tool for critically ill patients. Among ICU patients with COVID-19, RNA sequencings can identify gene expression, pathogens (including SARS-CoV-2), and can predict mortality.

357,National interest may require distributing COVID-19 vaccines to other countries,"As the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine progress, understanding how to distribute the initially scarce doses is of paramount importance and a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs involved in domestic-only versus cooperative distribution is still missing. In this study we use a network Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to show under which circumstances it is in a countrys self-interest to ensure other countries can also obtain a COVID-19 vaccine rather than focusing only on vaccination of their own residents. In particular, we focus our analysis on the USs decision and estimate the internal burden of COVID-19 disease under different scenarios about vaccine cooperation. We show that in scenarios in which the US has reached the threshold for domestic herd immunity, the US may find it optimal to donate doses to other countries with lower vaccination coverage, as this would allow for a sharp reduction in the inflow of infected individuals from abroad.",Tiziano Rotesi; Paolo Pin; Maria Cucciniello; Amyn A.

358,The feasibility of targeted test-trace-isolate for the control of B.1.1.7,"The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 reportedly exhibits substantially higher transmission than the ancestral strain and may generate a major surge of cases before vaccines become widely available. As B.1.1.7 can be sensitively detected using the Thermo Fisher TaqPath S-gene RT-PCR test, contact tracing and isolation programs appear well-suited to slowing the spread of the new variant, which is still rare in most of the dozens of countries in which it has been identified. However, key determinants of outcomes such as data-sharing, trace success, and isolation compliance vary widely between regions, which may discourage public health agencies from explicitly redirecting existing contact tracers to contain B.1.1.7. Here we apply a branching-process model to estimate the effectiveness of implementing a B.1.1.7-focused testing, contact tracing, and isolation strategy with realistic levels of performance. Our model indicates that bidirectional contact tracing can substantially slow the spread of B.1.1.7 even in regions where a large fraction of the population refuses to cooperate with contact tracers or to abide by quarantine and isolation requests.",William J Bradshaw; Jonathan H Huggins; Alun L Lloyd; Kevin M Esvelt,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249612,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249612,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
359,"Determining the optimal COVID-19 policy response using agent-based modelling linked to health and cost modelling: Case study for Victoria, Australia","BackgroundWe compared the health and economic consequences for the State of Victoria, Australia, of four COVID-19 strategies: aggressive and moderate elimination, tight suppression (aiming for 1 to 5 cases per million per day) and loose suppression (5 to 25 cases per million per day). The strategies shifted up and down through five levels of policy stringency based on the number of cases per day, for one year.

MethodsAn agent-based model (ABM) generated 100 runs of daily SARS-CoV-2 case numbers, that then fed into a proportional multistate lifetable to estimate health adjusted life years (HALYs) and costs. We used a net monetary benefit approach to estimate the optimal strategy.

FindingsAggressive elimination resulted in the highest percentage of days with the lowest level of restrictions (median 31.7%, 90% simulation interval 6.6% to 64.4%). However, days in hard lockdown were similar across all four strategies (medians 27.5% to 36.1%).

HALY losses (compared to a no-COVID-19 scenario) were similar for moderate elimination (286, 219 to 389) and moderate elimination (314, 228 to 413), and nearly eight and 40-times higher for tight and loose suppression. The median GDP loss was least for moderate elimination ($US41.7 billion, $29.0 to $63.6 billion), but there was substantial overlap in simulation intervals between the four strategies.

From a health system perspective aggressive elimination was optimal in 64% of simulations above a willingness to pay of $15,000 per HALY, followed by moderate elimination in 35% of simulations. Moderate elimination was optimal from a partial societal perspective in half the simulations followed by aggressive elimination in a quarter.

Shortening the pandemic duration to 6 months saw loose suppression become preferable under a partial societal perspective.

InterpretationFor this single high-income jurisdiction, elimination strategies were preferable over a 1-year pandemic duration.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere have been varying approaches across countries and jurisdictions as to how to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from elimination of community transmission (e.g. Australasia, Taiwan and other East Asian and Pacific Island countries) to loose suppression or mitigation that attempts to keep the case numbers within health services capacity (e.g. Sweden, USA, India, UK and some continental European countries). The best or optimal approach is unknown, and involves an invidious balancing of health, social and economic consequences of the pandemic. But it has become apparent that in high income countries using loose suppression that one still has to use lock-downs from time to time to keep case numbers within health service capacity, raising the question as to what is the best for the economy - attempting elimination, tight suppression or loose suppression?

One approach to integrating the health and economic consequences is cost effectiveness analysis, but to date such approaches have mainly been focused on SARS-CoV-2 treatments rather than societal intervention, and have not incorporated a counterfactual approach to compare the same jurisdiction across the many (stochastically varying) realizations for different policy options.

Added value of this studyThis study uses one high-income jurisdiction, the state of Victoria in Australia as it exited its second wave, to estimate the health and economic consequences of four policy options: aggressive and moderate elimination strategies, and tight and loose suppression strategies. The modeling is done in two steps: first, an agent-based model to simulate 100 possible trajectories of daily SARS-CoV-2 infections over one year for each of the four policy options; and second, an integrated epidemiological and economic model that estimates health and economic costs. Whilst there is considerable uncertainty in outcomes for all of the four policy options, the two elimination options are usually optimal from both a health system and a partial societal (health expenditure plus GDP cost) perspective. However, if the remaining duration of the pandemic is lessened from 1 year to half a year (as may be the case with vaccine roll-outs), loose suppression becomes more favorable - suggesting countries with already high infection rates  ride it out till vaccination coverage is adequate.",Professor Tony Blakely; Dr Jason Thompson; Dr Laxman Bablani; Patrick Andersen; Dr Driss Ait Ouakrim; Dr Natalie Carvalho; Patrick Abraham; Marie-Anne Boujaoude; Ameera Katar; Edifofon Akpan; Nick Wilson; Professor Mark Stevenson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249630,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249630,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
360,The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in England: key epidemiological drivers and impact of interventions,"We fitted a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in care homes and the community to regional surveillance data for England. Among control measures implemented, only national lockdown brought the reproduction number below 1 consistently; introduced one week earlier it could have reduced first wave deaths from 36,700 to 15,700 (95%CrI: 8,900-26,800). Improved clinical care reduced the infection fatality ratio from 1.25% (95%CrI: 1.18%-1.33%) to 0.77% (95%CrI: 0.71%-0.84%). The infection fatality ratio was higher in the elderly residing in care homes (35.9%, 95%CrI: 29.1%-43.4%) than those residing in the community (10.4%, 95%CrI: 9.1%-11.5%). England is still far from herd immunity, with regional cumulative infection incidence to 1st December 2020 between 4.8% (95%CrI: 4.4%-5.1%) and 15.4% (95%CrI: 14.9%-15.9%) of the population.

361,"Transmission dynamics and forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, March 20-November 11, 2020.","The ongoing coronavirus pandemic reached Mexico in late February 2020. Since then Mexico has observed a sustained elevation in the number of COVID-19 deaths. Mexicos delayed response to the COVID-19 pandemic until late March 2020 hastened the spread of the virus in the following months. However, the government followed a phased reopening of the country in June 2020 despite sustained virus transmission. In order to analyze the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, we systematically generate and compare the 30-day ahead forecasts of national mortality trends using various growth models in near real-time and compare forecasting performance with those derived using the COVID-19 model developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We also estimate and compare reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-2 based on methods that rely on both the genomic data as well as case incidence data to gauge the transmission potential of the virus. Moreover, we perform a spatial analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico by analyzing the shapes of COVID-19 growth rate curves at the state level, using techniques from functional data analysis. The early estimate of reproduction number indicates sustained disease transmission in the country with R[~]1.3. However, the estimate of R as of September 27, 2020 is [~]0.91 indicating a slowing down of the epidemic. The spatial analysis divides the Mexican states into four groups or clusters based on the growth rate curves, each with its distinct epidemic trajectory. Moreover, the sequential forecasts from the GLM and Richards model also indicate a sustained downward trend in the number of deaths for Mexico and Mexico City compared to the sub-epidemic and IHME model that outperformed the others and predict a more stable trajectory of COVID-19 deaths for the last three forecast periods.

Author summaryMexico has been confronting the COVID-19 epidemic since late February under a fragile health care system and economic recession. The country delayed the implementation of social distancing interventions resulting in continued virus transmission in the country and reopened its economy in June 2020. In order to investigate the unfolding of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico and Mexico City the authors utilize the mortality data to generate and compare thirteen sequentially generated short-term forecasts using phenomenological growth models. Moreover, the reproduction number is estimated from genomic and time series data to determine the transmission potential of the epidemic, and spatial analysis using case incidence data is conducted to identify the characteristic growth patterns of the epidemic in different Mexican states including rapid increase in the growth rate followed by a rapid decline and slow growth rate followed by a rapid rise and a rapid decline. The best performing models indicate a more sustained transmission of the pandemic in Mexico. The forecasts generated from the GLM and Richards growth model indicate towards a sustained decline in the number of deaths whereas the sub-epidemic model and IHME model point towards a stable epidemic trajectory for forecasting periods as of August 23, 2020.",Amna Tariq; Juan M.

362,Monitoring the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 from age-stratified hospitalisation and serological data,"BackgroundRegional monitoring of the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 is important to guide local management of the epidemic, but is difficult in the absence of regular nationwide serosurveys.

MethodsWe developed a method to reconstruct in real-time the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected from the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation and case data. We applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions.

FindingsWe estimate that 5.7% [5.1%-6.4%] of adults in metropolitan France had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 by May 2020. This proportion remained stable until August and increased to 12.6% [11.2%-14.3%] by the end of November. With 23.8% [21.2%-26.8%] infected in the Paris region compared to 4.0% [3.5% - 4.6%] in Brittany, regional variations remained large (Coefficient of Variation CV: 0.53) although less so than in May (CV: 0.74). The proportion infected was twice higher (17.6% [13.4%-22.7%]) in 20-49 y.o. than in 50+ y.o (8.0% [5.7% - 11.5%]). Forty percent [33.7% - 45.4%] of infections in adults were detected in June-August compared to 55.7% [48.7% - 63.1%] in September-November. Our method correctly predicted seroprevalence in 11 regions in which only hospitalisation data were used.

InterpretationIn the absence of contemporary serosurvey, our real-time monitoring indicates that the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 may be above 20% in some French regions.

364,Lessons learnt from the use of compartmental models over the COVID-19 induced lockdown in France,"BackgroundCompartmental models may help deciding on public health interventions. They were used during the first French COVID-19 lockdown to estimate the reproduction numbers and predict the number of hospital beds required. This study aimed to assess the ability of similar compartmental models to reflect equivalent epidemic dynamics.

MethodsThe study considered three compartmental models independently designed to describe the COVID-19 outbreak in France. These models were scrutinized and their compartments and parameters expressed in a common framework. The parameters were set alike in the three models according to values taken from the literature. The models were calibrated using a common maximum likelihood function and the same hospitalization data taken from two official public databases. The calibration procedure was repeated over three different periods to compare model abilities to (1) fit over the whole lockdown; (2) predict the course of the epidemic during the lockdown; and, (3) provide a set of profiles to forecast the hospitalization prevalence after the lockdown. The study considered national and regional coverages.

ResultsThe three models were all flexible enough to match hospitalization data during the lockdown, but the numbers of cases in the other compartments differed. The three models failed to predict reliably the number of hospitalizations after the fitting periods at national and regional levels. At the national scale, a refined calibration led to epidemic course profiles that reflected hospitalizations dynamics and corresponded to reproduction numbers coherent with official and literature estimates. This result could not be consistently obtained at the regional scale.

ConclusionNot all predictions were consistent between models. Even over the period used for calibration by fitting to hospitalization cases, important differences remained regarding the prevalence in the other compartments. Prevalence data are needed to further constrain the calibration and perform selection between still divergent models. This underlines strongly the need for repeated prevalence studies on representative samples, stratified by age and regions, which would undergo virological or serological tests.",Romain Gauchon; Nicolas Ponthus; Catherine Pothier; Christophe Rigotti; Vitaly Volpert; Stephane Derrode; Jean-Pierre Bertoglio; Alexis Bienvenue; Pierre-Olivier Goffard; Anne Eyraud-Loisel; Simon Pageaud; Jean Iwaz; Stephane Loisel; Pascal Roy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249565,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249565,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True

A growing number of studies have shown worsening mental health measures globally during the pandemic. However, there is a lack of empirical study on how people support their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine a number of formal and informal mental health supports. Further, it explored factors that might be associated with the use of different types mental health support.

MethodData from 26,740 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study were analysed between 13th April, 2020 and 3rd July, 2020. Data were analysed using logistic and Poisson regression models.

ResultsAbout 45% of people reported talking to friends or family members to support their mental health, 43% engaging in self-care activities, 20% taking medication, 9% speaking to mental health professionals, 8% talking to a GP or other health professional, and another 8% using helpline or online services. Gender, education, living status, loneliness, pre-existing mental health conditions, general depression and anxiety, coping and personality were found to be associated with the use of mental health support.

ConclusionWhile the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are inevitable, people can play an active role in managing their mental health.

While delivering billions of COVID 19 doses globally addressing vaccine hesitancy will be one of the most significant public health communication efforts ever undertaken.

ObjectiveThe goal of this study is to explore predictors of COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy, including sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, risk perception, and experience of discrimination, in a sample of the U.S. population.

DesignWe used a cross sectional online survey study design. The survey was implemented between Dec 13 and 23, 2020.

SettingThe survey was limited to respondents over 18 years of age residing in the USA.

ParticipantsRespondents were individuals belonging to priority groups for vaccine distribution.

Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Respondents were asked how likely they would be to take a COVID 19 vaccine if offered at no cost within two months. Vaccine hesitancy was measured using a scale ranging from 1 (low hesitancy) to 6 (high hesitancy).

ResultsResponses were received from 2,650 respondents (response rate 84%) from all 50 states and Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam. The majority were in the age category between 25 and 44 years (66%), male (53%), and working in the healthcare sector (61%). Most were White and non-Hispanic (66%) respondents followed by Black non-Hispanic (14%) and Hispanic (8%) respondents. Experience with racial discrimination was a predictor of vaccine hesitancy. Those reporting racial discrimination having 21% increased odds of being at a higher level of hesitancy compared to those who did not report such experience (OR=1.21, 95% C.I. 1.01-1.45).

367,Based Analysis Framework for identifying COVID-19 Incidence and Fatality Determinants at National Level Case study: Africa,"Abstract Background: COVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary threat with significant implications in all aspects of human life, therefore, it represents the most immediate challenges for all countries all over the world. Objectives: This study is intended to develop a GIS-based analysis model to explore, quantify and model the relationships between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and their potential predictor variables. Method: For this purpose, a model was developed to estimate COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates in Africa up to 16th of August 2020 at the national level. The model involved Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis through ArcGIS was applied. Result: Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis revealed that there was positive spatial autocorrelation in COVID-19 incidence (Moran index 0.16. P value <0.1), and fatality (Moran index 0.0.35, P value<0.01) rates within different African countries. At continental level, OLS revealed that COVID-19 incidence rate was found to be positively associated with overcrowding, health expenditure, HIV infections and air pollution and negatively associated with BCG vaccine ({beta}=2.97,1.45, 0.01, 3.29, -47.65 respectively, P< 0.05) At the same time, COVID-19 fatality was found to be positively related to asthma prevalence and tobacco use. Yet, certain level of inconsistency was noted in the case of COVID-19 fatality, which was negatively related to elder population, poverty, and cardiovascular mortality (P<0.05). This model showed convenient level of validity in modeling the relationship between COVID-19 incidence as well as fatality and their key predictors using GWR. In this respect, the model explained about 58% and 55% of the variance in COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates, respectively, as a function of considered predictors. Conclusion: Application of the suggested model can assist in guiding intervention strategies, particularly in case of local and community level whenever the data on COVID-19 cases and predictors variables are available.",Mahmoud A Hassaan; Ramy M Ghazy; Rofida G.

368,Impact of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) on the Mental Health and Physical Activity of Pharmacy Students at the University of Zambia: A Cross-Sectional Study,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a serious global health problem that has negatively impacted the mental health of students.

MethodsWe conducted an online descriptive cross-sectional study among 273 undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. A partial proportional odds regression model was used to determine the predictors of anxiety. All statistical tests were set at 95% confidence level (p<0.05).

ResultsA response rate of 70% was obtained with the majority of the students being female 51.6%. Of the 273 respondents, 23.8% did not experience anxiety, 34.4% experienced mild anxiety, 24.9% experienced moderate anxiety while 16.9% experienced severe anxiety about COVID-19. It was also found that 61.2% of students reported that their attention to mental health increased during the COVID-19 pandemic whereas 44.3% reported an increased resting time with a significant reduction in relaxation 51.3% and physical activity 45.4% time. Factors that affected mental health included; reduced family care (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.09-4.74), not changing attention to mental health (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18-0.62), being in the final year of study (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13-0.84), reduced time of resting (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.26-3.50) and feeling helpless (OR: 0.42; 95% CI:0.23-0.75).

ConclusionCOVID-19 negatively impacted the mental health and physical activity of pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. This can have negative health and academic outcomes for students going forward.

369,Aerosol tracer testing in the cabin of wide-bodied Boeing 767 and 777 aircraft to simulate exposure potential of infectious particulate such as SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reintroduced questions regarding the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure amongst passengers on an aircraft. Quantifying risk with computational fluid dynamics models or contact tracing methods alone is challenging, as experimental results for inflight biological aerosols is lacking. Using fluorescent aerosol tracers and real time optical sensors, coupled with DNA-tagged tracers for aerosol deposition, we executed ground and inflight testing on Boeing 767 and 777 airframes.

Analysis here represents tracer particles released from a simulated infected passenger, in multiple rows and seats, to determine the exposure risk via penetration into breathing zones in that row and numerous rows ahead and behind the index case. We completed over 65 releases of 180,000,000 fluorescent particles from the source, with 40+ Instantaneous Biological Analyzer and Collector sensors placed in passenger breathing zones for real-time measurement of simulated virus particle penetration.

Results from both airframes showed a minimum reduction of 99.54% of 1 {micro}m aerosols from the index source to the breathing zone of a typical passenger seated directly next to the source. An average 99.97 to 99.98% reduction was measured for the breathing zones tested in the 767 and 777, respectively. Contamination of surfaces from aerosol sources was minimal, and DNA-tagged 3 {micro}m tracer aerosol collection techniques agreed with fluorescent methodologies.",Sean M Kinahan; David B Silcott; Blake E Silcott; Ryan M Silcott; Peter J Silcott; Braden J Silcott; Steven L Distelhorst; Vicki L Herrera; Danielle N Rivera; Kevin K Crown; Gabriel A Lucero; Joshua Santarpia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249626,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249626,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
370,Genomic and mobility data reveal mass population movement as a driver of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and diversity in Bangladesh,"BackgroundNew data streams are being used to track the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, including genomic data which provides insights into patterns of importation and spatial spread of the virus, as well as population mobility data obtained from mobile phones. Here, we analyse the emergence and outbreak trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh using these new data streams, and identify mass population movements as a key early event driving the ongoing epidemic.

MethodsWe sequenced complete genomes of 67 SARS-CoV-2 samples (March-July 2020) and combined this dataset with 324 genomes from Bangladesh. For phylogenetic context, we also used 68,000 GISAID genomes collected globally. We paired this genomic data with population mobility information from Facebook and three mobile phone operators.

FindingsThe majority (85%) of the Bangladeshi sequenced isolates fall into either pangolin lineage B.1.36 (8%), B.1.1 (19%) or B.1.1.25 (58%). Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis predicted SARS-COV-2 first appeared in mid-February, through international introductions. The first case was reported on March 8th. This pattern of repeated international introduction changed at the end of March when three discrete lineages expanded and spread clonally across Bangladesh. The shifting pattern of viral diversity across Bangladesh is reflected in the mobility data which shows the mass migration of people from cities to rural areas at the end of March, followed by frequent travel between Dhaka and the rest of the country during the following months.

InterpretationIn Bangladesh, population mobility out of Dhaka as well as frequent travel from urban hotspots to rural areas resulted in rapid country-wide dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. The strains in Bangladesh reflect the local expansion of global lineages introduced early from international travellers to and from major international travel hubs. Importantly, the Bangladeshi context is consistent with epidemiologic and phylogenetic findings globally. Bangladesh is one of the few countries in the world with a rich history of conducting mass vaccination campaigns under complex circumstances. Combining genomics and these new data streams should allow population movements to be modelled and anticipated rendering Bangladesh extremely well prepared to immunize citizens rapidly. Based on our genomics data and the countrys successful immunization history, vaccines becoming available globally will be suitable for implementation in Bangladesh while ongoing genomic surveillance is conducted to monitor for new variants of the virus.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic, has motivated all countries in the world to obtain high resolution data on the virus. Globally over 300,000 strains have been sequenced and information made available in GISAID. Within the first 100 days of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, genomic analysis from different countries led to the development of vaccines which have now reached market. Information on the prevailing genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 since introduction is needed in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Bangladesh, in order to determine the suitability of therapeutics and vaccines in the pipeline and help vaccine deployment.

Added value of this studyWe sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from strains that were prospectively collected during the height of the pandemic and combined these genomic data with mobility data to comprehensively describe i) how repeated international importations of SARS-CoV-2 were ultimately linked to nationwide spread, ii) 85% of strains belonged to the Pangolin lineages B.1.1, B.1.1.25 and B.1.36 and that similar mutation rates were observed as seen globally iii) the switch in genomic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 coincided with mass migration out of cities to the rest of the country. We have assessed the contributions of population mobility on the maintenance and spread of clonal lineages of SARS-CoV-2. This is the first time these data types have been combined to look at the spread of this virus nationally.

Implications of all the available evidenceSARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity and mutation rate in Bangladesh is comparable to strains circulating globally. Notably, the data on the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh is reassuring, suggesting that immunotherapeutic and vaccines being developed globally should also be suitable for this population. Since Bangladesh already has extensive experience of conducting mass vaccination campaigns, such as the rollout of the oral Cholera vaccine, experience of developing and using new data streams will enable efficient and targeted immunization of the population in 2021 with COVID-19 vaccine(s).",Lauren A.

371,A Scoping Review of the Experience of Implementing Population Testing for SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the swift introduction of population testing programmes in many countries across the world, using testing modalities such as drive-through, walk-through, mobile and home visiting programmes. Here, we provide an overview of the literature describing the experience of implementing population testing for SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsWe conducted a scoping review using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane Library in addition to a grey literature search. We identified indicators relevant to process, quality and resource outcomes related to each testing modality.

Results2,999 titles were identified from the academic literature and the grey literature search, of which 22 were relevant. Most studies were from the USA and the Republic of Korea. Drive-through testing centres were the most common testing modality evaluated and these provided a rapid method of testing whilst minimising resource use.

ConclusionsThe evidence base for population testing lacks high quality studies, however, the literature provides evaluations of the advantages and limitations of different testing modalities.

372,Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Neuromuscular Performance in Patients Recovered from COVID-19,"ObjectiveCOVID-19 affects cardiorespiratory and muscular systems, causing dysfunctions that may persist after recovery from the acute infection and treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness and neuromuscular performance in these patients.

MethodsPatients recovered from mild (n=31) and severe (n=17) COVID-19 were evaluated and compared to healthy subjects (n=15). All volunteers underwent a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test with simultaneous acquisition of electromyography (EMG). Power output, oxygen uptake (VO2), pulse oxygen (O2Pulse), cardiovascular efficiency ({Delta}HR/{Delta}VO2), ventilation (VE), breathing reserve (BR) and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope) were analyzed. From EMG, power output for type Ia and IIa activation as well as total neuromuscular efficiency ({Delta}watts/{Delta}%RMS) were determined.

ResultsPatients with severe COVID-19 presented lower VO2, O2Pulse and VE than mild COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). No differences in {Delta}HR/{Delta}VO2, BR or VE/VCO2 slope were observed among the groups (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Type IIa and IIb fibers were activated at lower power output in severe than in mild COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects (p < 0.05). {Delta}watts/{Delta}%RMS was lower in severe than in mild COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects (p < 0.05).

373,"The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on university students' dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour","University students are a vulnerable group for poor dietary intake, insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on university students dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Participants were students (n=125) from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. An online questionnaire was administered retrospectively (for pre-pandemic) and prospectively (during the pandemic) to examine students dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Overall, nutrient and caloric intakes were significantly reduced (p<0.05) during the pandemic, and alcohol intake increased (p=0.03). Before the pandemic, 16% and 54% of the participants were meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults (18-64 years) of 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity and 8 hours or less of sedentary activity respectively. Only 10% met the guidelines for physical activity while 30% met the guidelines for sedentary behaviour during the pandemic. The minutes per week spent engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the pandemic decreased by approximately 20% (p<0.001). The hours spent in sedentary activities increased by 3 hours per day (p<0.001). Our findings confirm that during the pandemic, students inadequate dietary intake, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour were significantly compounded.

We explore the ramifications of hospital load due to COVID-19 morbidity on COVID-19 hospitalized patient mortality. We address this question with a nationwide study based on the records of all 19,336 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Israel from mid-July 2020 to early January 2021. We show that even under moderately heavy patient load (>500 countrywide hospitalized severely-ill patients; the Israeli Ministry of Health defined 800 severely-ill patients as the maximum capacity allowing adequate treatment), in-hospital mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 significantly increased compared to periods of lower patient load (250-500 severely-ill patients); we further show this higher mortality rate cannot be attributed to changes in the patient population during periods of heavier load.",Hagai Rossman; Tomer Meir; Jonathan Somer; Smadar Shilo; Rom Gutman; Asaf Ben Arie; Eran Segal; Uri Shalit; Malka Gorfine,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249526,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.21249526,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True
375,Modelling the impact of household size distribution on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19,"Under the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and lockdowns, household transmission has been shown to be significant for COVID-19, posing challenges for reducing incidence in settings where people are asked to self-isolate at home and to spend increasing amounts of time at home due to distancing measures. Accordingly, characteristics of households in a region have been shown to relate to transmission heterogeneity of the virus. We introduce a stochastic epidemiological model to examine the impact of the household size distribution in a region on the transmission dynamics. We choose parameters to reflect incidence in two health regions of the Greater Vancouver area in British Columbia and simulate the impact of distancing measures on transmission, with household size distribution the only different parameter between simulations for the two regions. Our result suggests that the dissimilarity in household size distribution alone can cause significant differences in incidence of the two regions, and the distributions drive distinct dynamics that match reported cases. Furthermore, our model suggests that offering individuals a place to isolate outside their household can speed the decline in cases, and does so more effectively where there are more larger households.",Pengyu Liu; Lisa McQuarrie; Yexuan Song; Caroline Colijn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249707,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.21249707,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,True

The number of asymptomatic healthy people is completely unknown because they remain untested. Detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been widely accepted as a diagnostic test, and an immunochromatographic test, which is simpler and relatively cheaper than other methods, is becoming the gold standard for identifying healthy people who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past. In this study, 1,528 volunteers who worked at a particular hospital were subjected to an immunochromatographic IgG test for SARS-CoV-2 to determine the ratio of asymptomatic people. Only 12 volunteers (0.79%) were IgG+, with no significant background differences in the sex, age, profession, experiences of working at the emergency department or caring for coronavirus disease 2019 patients. If this IgG+ ratio was to be extrapolated to Wakayama citys population, 2,780 out of 3,54,063 people may be asymptomatic for SARS-CoV-2.

This is an ecological study whose units of analysis were the Special Indigenous Sanitary Districts. Cases and deaths by COVID-19 notified by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health between March and October 2020 were included. To verify the spatial association, the Getis-Ord General G and Getis-Ord Gi * techniques were used. High spatial risk clusters have been identified by the scan statistics technique. 32,041 cases of COVID-19 and 471 deaths were reported. The incidence and mortality rates were between 758.14 and 18530.56 cases and 5.96 and 265.37 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants, respectively. The non-randomness of cases (z-score = 5.40; p <0.001) and deaths (z-score = 3.83; p <0.001) was confirmed. Hotspots were evidenced for both events with confidence levels of 90, 95 and 99% concentrated in the North and Midwest regions of the country. Eight high-risk spatial clusters for cases with a relative risk (RR) between 1.08 and 4.11 (p <0.05) and two risk clusters for deaths with RR between 3.08 and 3.97 (p <0.05) were identified.

The objective of this work was to evaluate whether peptides from S protein could cause negative impact in the aquatic animals. The aquatic toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides derivatives has been evaluated in tadpoles (n = 50 tadpoles / 5 replicates of 10 animals) from species Physalaemus cuvieri (Leptodactylidae). After synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides (PSDP2001, PSDP2002, PSDP2003) an aquatic contamination has been simulatedwith these peptides during 24 hours of exposure in two concentrations (100 and 500 ng/mL). The control group (""C"") was composed of tadpoles kept in polyethylene containers containing de-chlorinated water. Oxidative stress, antioxidant biomarkers and neurotoxicity activity were assessed. In both concentrations, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 increased catalase and superoxide dismutase antioxidants enzymes activities, as well as oxidative stress (nitrite levels, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species). All three peptides also increased acetylcholinesterase activity in the highest concentration. These peptides showed molecular interactions in silico with acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes. Aquatic particle contamination of SARS-CoV-2 has neurotoxics effects in P. cuvieri tadpoles. These findings indicate that the COVID-19 can constitute environmental impact or biological damage potential.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the search for new and fast methods to identify novel or repurposed therapeutic drugs. A popular method to identify antiviral drugs is the use of antibody-based immunofluorescence to visualise infected cells. However, this method lacks depth towards the effect of such drugs on the host cells. Here we present a phenomics workflow for untargeted phenotypic drug screening of virus infected cells, combining Cell Painting with antibody-based detection of viral infection in a single and simple method and provide a semi-automated image analysis pipeline for classification and feature extraction of virus infected cells. Our phenomics workflow provides valuable information about the effect of both virus and drugs on the host cells.

To be able to assess the risk of viral escape from neutralization by first-wave antibodies, we leveraged our capability for Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation of the spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) and its binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) to predict alterations in molecular interactions resulting from the presence of the E484K, K417N, and N501Y variants found in the South African 501Y.V2 strain - alone and in combination. We report here the combination of E484K, K417N and N501Y results in the highest degree of conformational alterations of S RBD when bound to hACE2, compared to either E484K or N501Y alone. Both E484K and N501Y increase affinity of S RBD for hACE2 and E484K in particular switches the charge on the flexible loop region of RBD which leads to the formation of novel favorable contacts. Enhanced affinity of S RBD for hACE2 very likely underpins the greater transmissibility conferred by the presence of either E484K or N501Y; while the induction of conformational changes may provide an explanation for evidence that the 501Y.V2 variant, distinguished from the B.1.1.7 UK variant by the presence of E484K, is able to escape neutralization by existing first-wave anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and re-infect COVID-19 convalescent individuals.",Gard Nelson; Oleksandr Buzko; Patricia R Spilman; Kayvan Niazi; Shahrooz Rabizadeh; Patrick R Soon-Shiong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426558,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426558,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False
382,Ineffectual AEC1 Differentiation from KRT8hi Transitional Cells without Fibrosis Associated with Fatal Acute Respiratory Failure in COVID-19 ARDS,"COVID-19 ARDS is associated with prolonged ventilator dependence and high mortality, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Critical to the pathogenesis of ARDS is injury to the alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) barrier; clinical recovery requires epithelial regeneration. We previously identified a KRT8hi transitional state that regenerating AEC2s adopt during differentiation into AEC1s, the persistence of which may be pathogenic in pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we hypothesize that ineffectual differentiation of transitional cells into AEC1s without fibrosis may underlie ongoing barrier permeability and poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 ARDS. To test this hypothesis, we examined postmortem lung tissue of COVID-19 ARDS patients. We observed severe epithelial injury, AEC2 proliferation, and abundant transitional cells but ineffectual AEC1 differentiation. Transitional cells were cuboidal, partially spread, or flat and adherent to alveolar septa that were denuded of AEC1s but structurally normal without fibrosis. We conclude that ineffectual AEC1 differentiation from transitional AECs may underlie ongoing barrier permeability and poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 ARDS. However, in contrast to fibrosis, transitional cells may retain the capacity for AEC1 differentiation with restoration of normal alveolar architecture and function. Novel therapies that promote differentiation of transitional cells into AEC1s may accelerate barrier restoration and clinical recovery in ARDS.",Christopher Ting; Mohit Aspal; Neil Vaishampayan; Steven K.

383,Distinct lung-homing receptor expression and activation profiles on NK cell and T cell subsets in COVID-19 and influenza,"Respiratory viral infections with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses commonly induce a strong infiltration of immune cells into the lung, with potential detrimental effects on the integrity of the lung tissue. Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung, little is known about how blood natural killer (NK) cells and T cell subsets are equipped for lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Using 28-colour flow cytometry and re-analysis of published RNA-seq datasets, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in peripheral blood from moderately sick COVID-19 and influenza patients, focusing on the expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the lung. The results reveal a predominant role for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 in COVID-19 and influenza patients, mirrored by scRNA-seq signatures in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage from publicly available datasets. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation as compared to cells lacking lung-homing receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza as compared to COVID-19. Together, our results indicate migration of functionally competent CXCR3+, CXCR6+, and/or CCR5+ NK cells and T cells to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients, identifying potential common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral infections.

Author summaryThe composition of in particular CXCR3+ and/or CXCR6+ NK cells and T cells is altered in peripheral blood upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus in patients with moderate disease.

Using this approach, we identified a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in the United States (U.S.). The earliest sequenced genomes of this variant, referred to as 20C-US, can be traced to Texas in late May of 2020. This variant circulated in the U.S. uncharacterized for months and rose to recent prevalence during the third pandemic wave. It initially acquired five novel, relatively unique non-synonymous mutations. 20C-US is continuing to acquire multiple new mutations, including three independently occurring spike protein mutations. Monitoring the ongoing evolution of 20C-US, as well as other novel emerging variants, will be essential for understanding SARS-CoV-2 host adaptation and predicting pandemic outcomes.",Adrian A Pater; Michael S Bosmeny; Christopher L Barkau; Katy N Ovington; Ramdevi Chilamkurthy; Mansi Parasrampuria; Seth B Eddington; Abadat O Yinusa; Adam A White; Paige E Metz; Rourke J Sylvain; Madison M Hebert; Scott W Benzinger; Koushik T Sinha; Keith T Gagnon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.426287,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.11.426287,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False
385,Fatal neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice is partially dependent on hACE2 expression,"Animal models recapitulating the distinctive features of severe COVID-19 are critical to enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) under the cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE2) represent a lethal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the cause(s) and mechanisms of lethality in this mouse model remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection for up to 14 days post-infection. Despite infection and moderate inflammation in the lungs, lethality was invariably associated with viral neuroinvasion and neuronal damage (including spinal motor neurons). Neuroinvasion occurred following virus transport through the olfactory neuroepithelium in a manner that was only partially dependent on hACE2. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 tropism was overall neither widespread among nor restricted to only ACE2-expressing cells. Although our work incites caution in the utility of the K18-hACE2 model to study global aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, it underscores this model as a unique platform for exploring the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis.

386,Rigid monoclonal antibodies improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the basis of treatments and diagnostics for pathogens and other biological phenomena. We conducted a structural characterization of mAbs against the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein (NPNTD) from SARS-CoV-2 using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Our solution-based results distinguished the mAbs flexibility and how this flexibility impacts the assembly of multiple mAbs on an antigen. By pairing two mAbs that bind different epitopes on the NPNTD, we show that flexible mAbs form a closed sandwich-like complex. With rigid mAbs, a juxtaposition of the Fabs is prevented, enforcing a linear arrangement of the mAb pair, which facilitates further mAb polymerization. In a modified sandwich ELISA, we show the rigid mAb-pairings with linear polymerization led to increased NPNTD detection sensitivity. These enhancements can expedite the development of more sensitive and selective antigen-detecting point-of-care lateral flow devices (LFA), key for early diagnosis and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.",Curtis D Hodge; Daniel J Rosenberg; Mateusz Wilamowski; Andrzej D Joachimiak; Greg L Hura; Michal Hammel,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426597,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426597,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False

388,Targeting conserved viral virulence determinants by single domain antibodies to block SARS-CoV2 infectivity,"We selected SARS-CoV2 specific single domain antibodies (sdAbs) from a previously constructed phage display library using synthetic immunogenic peptides of the virus spike (S) protein as bait. The sdAbs targeting the cleavage site (CS) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in S protein efficiently neutralised the infectivity of a pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV2 S protein. Anti-CS sdAb blocked the virus infectivity by inhibiting proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV2 S protein. Both the sdAbs retained characteristic structure within the pH range of 2 to 12 and remained stable upto 65{degrees}C. Furthermore, structural disruptions induced by a high temperature in both the sdAbs were largely reversed upon their gradual cooling and the resulting products neutralised the reporter virus. Our results therefore suggest that targeting CS in addition to the RBD of S protein by sdAbs could serve as a viable option to reduce SARS-CoV2 infectivity and that proteolytic processing of the viral S protein is critical for infection.",Sudhakar Singh; Surbhi Dahiya; Yuviana J Singh; Komal Beeton; Ayush Jain; Roman Sarkar; Abhishek Dubey; Syed Azeez Tehseen; Sharvan Sehrawat,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426537,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.426537,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,,False

We have begun virtually in this field since COVID-19 pandemic, besides our divergence in the infectious agents. In this study and based on the previous review, Hypericum perforatum (St. Johns Wort) and Echinacea (gaia HERBS(R)) were tested in vitro using Vero E6 cells for their anti-viral effects against the newly identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through its infectious cycle from 0 to 48 hours post infection. The hypericin (0.9 mg) of H. perforatum and the different parts (roots, seeds, aerial) of two types of Echinacea species (Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia) were examined their efficacy in certain concentration and under light-dependent anti-viral activities to measure the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA expression of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene and the viral load with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and to assess the neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding on cell culture assay. Interestingly, the mixture (H.E.) of 100 mg/mL of H. perforatum and Echinacea was tested too on SARS-CoV-2 and showed crucial anti-viral activity competing H. perforatum then Echinacea effects as anti-viral treatment. Therefore, the results of gaia HERBS(R) products, H. perforatum and Echinacea species, applied in this study showed significant anti-viral and virucidal effects in the following order of potency: H. perforatum, H.E., and Echinacea on SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle; and will definitely required a set up of clinical trial with specific therapeutic protocol based on the outcome of this study.

Author SummaryAfter an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in the Southern region of Saudi Arabia, particularly in May 2003, Special Infectious Agents Unit (SIAU) was established and founded by Prof. Esam Ibraheem Azhar. This unit contains a full range of facilities including Biosafety Level 3, allows him and his research groups to ambulate and culture risk group 3 viruses in Saudi Arabia & Gulf States for the first time. Since that time, SIAU and our international collaboration have been extended to implement a standard protocols in the infectious agents diagnostics procedure through different mode of collaboration including exchange of expertise, joint research program and more recently a technology transfer agreements with number of international institute sharing same interests. Furthermore, we have been engaged in number of researches related to Hajj & Umrah plus number of national services with the Ministry of Health (MOH) through which, we utilize our Mobile biosafety level 3 Lab to enhance the diagnostics of MERS CoV in the Holly sites during Hajj since 2014.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional observational study and collected data from Medical Record Section during the COVID-19 pandemic from January to June 2020 and compared it with data from 2019 in similar months. Data collected was analyzed to find out the impact of COVID - 19 on use of pediatric emergency health services with respect to patient attendance, age and clinical profile before and during COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi.

ResultsWe observed a 43% decline in PED visits which increased to 75% during the period of lock-down (p value = 0.005). There was a significant decrease in children of age group 1-5 years attending PED. Mortality rate during lockdown had gone up by nearly 3times than the average monthly mortality.

391,Convergence of Comorbidity and COVID-19 Infection to Fatality: An Investigation Based on Concurrent Health Status Evaluation among the Elderly Population in Kerala,"The COVID-19 infection rapidly spread globally, mostly affecting the extremely vulnerable category of the elderly with comorbidities. There are inconsistencies in the findings on the type of comorbidity of the elderly and its association with fatalities. In this context, this research investigated the impact of comorbidity in the fatality of elderly COVID-19 patients in Kerala based on their healthcare status, functionality, and morbidity profiles. A concurrent mixed-method approach was adopted for the study to achieve the objectives, where the quantitative and qualitative data had been collected in the COVID-19 situation, from June to November 2020. This studys findings have been further triangulated with the COVID-19 elderly fatality data, which is available from the crowdsourced dashboard of the research team and two other volunteering dashboards. This paper establishes that comorbidities can predict potential fatality among elderly COVID-19 patients. While facing an epidemic like the present zoonotic disease, better knowledge of these high-risk factors will help clinicians to pinpoint the situation and implement therapeutic and preventive methodologies and interventions. The comorbidity level of the elderly in Kerala matches with the profile of COVID-19 death cases where heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension are the significant predictors of COVID-19 elderly fatality in Kerala.",Sindhu Joseph; Jijo Pulickiyil Ulahannan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.20249030,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.20249030,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,True
392,Altered kidney function and acute kidney damage markers predict survival outcomes of COVID-19 patients: A prospective pilot study.,"BackgroundThe central role in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), called as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infection is attributed to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). ACE-2 expressing respiratory system involvement is the main clinical manifestation of the infection. However, literature about the association between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and higher ACE-2 expressing kidney is very limited. In this study, we primarily aimed to investigate whether there is a kidney injury during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The predictive value of kidney injury for survival was also determined.

MethodsA total of 47 participants who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The participants were classified as   COVID-19 patients before treatment   COVID-19 patients after treatment,   COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU and   controls. The parameters comorbidity, serum creatinine and cystatin C levels, CKD-EPI eGFR levels, KIM-1 and NGAL levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine and NGAL/creatinine ratios were statistically compared between the groups. The associations between covariates including kidney disease indicators and death from COVID-19 were examined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.

ResultsSerum creatinine and cystatin C levels, urine KIM-1/creatinine levels, and CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels exhibited significant difference in the groups. The causes of the difference were more altered kidney function and increased acute kidney damage in COVID-19 patients before treatment and under treatment in ICU. Additionally, incidences of comorbidity and proteinuria in the urine analysis were higher in the COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU group. Urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria were associated with COVID-19 specific death.

ConclusionsWe found that COVID-19 patients under treatment in ICU exhibited extremely higher levels of serum cystatin C, and urine KIM-1/creatinine and urine NGAL/creatinine ratios. These results clearly described the acute kidney damage by COVID-19 using molecular kidney damage markers for the first time in the literature. Lowered CKD-EPI, CKD-EPI cystatin C and CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C eGFR levels were determined in them, as well. Urine KIM-1/creatinine ratio and proteinuria were associated with COVID-19 specific death.

393,"Pragmatic, open-label, single-center, randomized, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus in patients with severe pneumonia secondary to COVID-19: the TACROVID trial protocol","IntroductionSome COVID-19 patients evolve to severe lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome triggered by both the coronavirus infection and the subsequent host-immune response. Accordingly, the use of immunomodulatory agents has been suggested but still remains controversial. Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus may be an effective and safety drug combination for treating severe COVID-19 patients.

Methods and analysisTACROVID is a randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone, in patients at advanced stage of COVID-19 disease with lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory response. Patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two arms (42 patients in each group). The primary aim is to assess the time to clinical stability after initiating randomization. Clinical stability is defined as body temperature [&le;] 37.5{degrees}C, and PaO2/FiO2 > 400 and/or SatO2/FiO2 > 300, and respiratory rate [&le;]24 rpm; for 48 consecutive hours.

DiscussionMethylprednisolone and tacrolimus might be beneficial to treat those COVID-19 patients progressing into severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. The rationale for its use is the fast effect of methylprednisolone pulses and the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit both the CoV-2 replication and the secondary cytokine storm. Interestingly, both drugs are low-cost and can be manufactured on a large scale; thus, if effective and safe, a large number of patients could be treated in developed and developing countries.

394,Assessments of heavy lift UAV quadcopter drone to support COVID 19 vaccine cold chain delivery for indigenous people in remote areasin South East Asia,"Vaccine delivery is one important aspect need to be strengthened within health systems. One of the main challenges in COVID 19 vaccine delivery is how to cover indigenous population in remote and isolated forests in South East Asia. Another issue in COVID 19 cold chain delivery is requirement for a carrier that can maintain the suitable storage temperature. Related to this condition, COVID 19 vaccine should be delivered using heavy vaccine cooler box and this demand delivery system equipped with heavy lift capacity. In here, this study proposes and assess the potential used of heavy lift UAV quadcopter to expand the COVID 19 vaccine delivery to indigenous people living in village that impeded by rugged terrain. The landscape and terrain analysis show that access to the villages was dominated by 15%-45% slopes and the available access is only 1.5 m width trail. To transport 500 vials with 10 kg carrier along 2 km trail, it requires 2 persons to walk for 1 hour. By using drone, a straight line route with a length of 1.5 km can be developed. There were at least 3 drone types were available commercially to lift 10 kg load and several drones with payload capacity below 10 kg. For carrying 100 vials to village using drones, it is estimated the required delivery time was 1.23-1.38 minutes. Around 1.57-1.66 minute delivery times were required to transport 250 vials. For carrying the maximum and full loads of 500 vials or equals to 10 kg load, a drone requires in average of 3.13 minute delivery times. This required drone delivery time is significantly below the required time by walking that almost 1 hour. Drones were limited by flight operational times. Whereas all required delivery times for each drone assessed in this study were still below the drone operational time. The lowest drone operational time was 16 minutes and this is still higher than the time required for a drone to deliver the vaccine. Considering the effectiveness and anticipating vaccine vaccination, UAV quadcopter drone is a feasible option to support COVID 19 vaccine delivery to reach indigenous people in isolated areas.",Andrio Adwibowo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249494,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249494,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,True

A case control study was conducted to determine risk factors for bacterial infections where cases were defined as moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 patients with bacterial infection and those without were included as controls. Logistic regression analysis was performed.

ResultsOut of a total of 50 cases and 50 controls, greater proportion of cases had severe or critical disease at presentation as compared to control i.e 80% vs 30% (p<0.001). Hospital acquired pneumonia (72%) and Gram negative organisms (82%) were predominant. Overall antibiotic utilization was 82% and was 64% in patients who had no evidence of bacterial infection. The median length of stay was significantly longer among cases compared to controls (12.5 versus 7.5 days) (p=0.001). The overall mortality was 30%, with comparatively higher proportion of deaths among cases (42% versus 18%) (p=0.009). Severe or critical COVID-19 at presentation (AOR: 4.42 times; 95% CI; 1.63-11.9) and use of steroids (AOR: 4.60; 95% CI 1.24-17.05) were independently associated with risk of bacterial infections.

396,Enisamium is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase and shows improvement of recovery in COVID-19 patients in an interim analysis of a clinical trial,"Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 causes a mild to severe respiratory disease called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Control of SARS-CoV-2 spread will depend on vaccine-induced or naturally acquired protective herd immunity. Until then, antiviral strategies are needed to manage COVID-19, but approved antiviral treatments, such as remdesivir, can only be delivered intravenously. Enisamium (laboratory code FAV00A, trade name Amizon(R)) is an orally active inhibitor of influenza A and B viruses in cell culture and clinically approved in countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Here we show that enisamium can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections in NHBE and Caco-2 cells. In vitro, the previously identified enisamium metabolite VR17-04 directly inhibits the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that VR17-04 prevents GTP and UTP incorporation. To confirm enisamiums antiviral properties, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which needed medical care either with or without supplementary oxygen. Patients received either enisamium (500 mg per dose) or placebo for 7 days. A pre-planned interim analysis showed in the subgroup of patients needing supplementary oxygen (n = 77) in the enisamium group a mean recovery time of 11.1 days, compared to 13.9 days for the placebo group (log-rank test; p=0.0259). No significant difference was found for all patients (n = 373) or those only needing medical care (n = 296). These results thus suggest that enisamium is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and that enisamium treatment shortens the time to recovery for COVID-19 patients needing oxygen.

Significance statementSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Although vaccines are now becoming available to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread, the development of antivirals remains necessary for treating current COVID-19 patients and combating future coronavirus outbreaks. Here, we report that enisamium, which can be administered orally, can prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication and that its metabolite VR17-04 can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase in vitro. Moreover, we find that COVID-19 patients requiring supplementary oxygen, recover more quickly than patients treated with a placebo. Enisamium may therefore be an accessible treatment for COVID-19 patients.",Olha Holubovska; Denisa Bojkova; Stefano Elli; Marco bechtel; David Boltz; Miguel Muzzio; Xinjian Peng; Frederico Sala; Cesare Cosentino; Alla Mironenko; Jens Milde; Yuriy Lebed; Holger Stammer; Andrew Goy; Marco Guerrini; Lutz Mueller; Jindrich Cinatl; Victor Margitich; Aartjan te Velthuis,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249237,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.05.21249237,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,True

In this study, we hypothesize that certain weather conditions with an atmosphere having high content of air pollutants, might impact the transmission of COVID-19, in addition to the direct human to human diffusion. The Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests were chosen as an empirical methodology to conduct the statistical analysis. In this regard, we compiled a daily dataset of COVID-19 cases (Confirmed, Recovered, Deceased), Weather indicators (Temperature and relative humidity) and pollution indicators (PM 2.5, PM 10, NO2, CO, and SO2) in Delhi state of India. The effects of each parameter within three time frames of same day, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago are evaluated.

399,Impact of Residential Neighborhood and Race/Ethnicity on Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in the Bronx,"The socially vulnerable have been most affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to the aftermath of any major disaster. Racial and social minorities are experiencing a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of residential location/community and race/ethnicity on outcomes of COVID-19 infection among hospitalized patients within the Bronx. This was a single center retrospective observational cohort study that included SARS-CoV2 positive adult residents of the Bronx (stratified as residents of South Bronx vs Rest of Bronx) hospitalized between March-May 2020. Data extracted from hospital electronic medical records included residential addresses, race, comorbidities, and insurance details. Comorbidity burden other clinical and laboratory details were also assessed to determine their correlation to COVID-19 severity of illness and outcomes of mortality and length of stay.

As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic differentially affected outcomes in those in the more socially disadvantaged area of the South Bronx versus the rest of the Bronx borough. Residents of the South Bronx had a significantly higher comorbidity burden and had public insurance to access medical care in comparison to the remainder of the Bronx. Interestingly, for the patient population studied there was no observed difference in 30-day mortality by race/ethnicity among those infected with COVID- 19 in spite of the increased disease burden observed.

401,Exploration of interethnic variation in the ibuprofen metabolizing enzyme CYP2C9: a cautionary guide for treatment of COVID-19 symptoms,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a rapidly spreading infectious illness that causes a debilitating respiratory syndrome. Supportive therapy remains the standard for mild-to-moderate cases, including treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) e.g. ibuprofen, however such medications may increase COVID-19 complications when used in patients with acute viral respiratory infections. P450 enzyme CYP2C9 are known to be involved in the metabolism of NSAIDs, however, their pharmacogenetic data are limited. This study aims to better understand the genetic landscape of CYP2C9 sequence variation across different ethnic and geographic groups, in correlation with ibuprofen dosing guidelines. A cohort of 101 Jordanian Arab samples were retrospectively recruited and genotyped using Affymetrix DMET Plus Premier Package. This study identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2C9 in these Jordanian Arabs, within the context of over 100,000 global subjects in 417 published reports. Genetic structure analysis across populations revealed that Jordanian Arabs share the closest CYP2C9 sequence homology to Near East and European populations. However, European populations are 7.2x more likely to show impaired ibuprofen metabolism than Sub-Saharan populations, and 4.5x more likely than East Asian ancestry populations.. This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis for CYP2C9 allele frequencies across multi-ethnic populations world-wide. The use of modern genomic tools coupled with a proactive assessment of the most likely gene-drug candidates will lead to a better understanding of the role of pharmacogenetics for COVID-19 and more effective treatments.",Ammar Ali Almarzooq,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249508,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249508,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,True
402,Performance and Implementation Evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW Rapid Antigen Test in a High-throughput Drive-through Community Testing Site in Massachusetts,"BackgroundRapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Ag) that can be performed at point-of-care (POC) can supplement molecular testing and help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Deployment of an Ag RDT requires an understanding of its operational and performance characteristics under real-world conditions and in relevant subpopulations. We evaluated the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site in Massachusetts (MA) using anterior nasal (AN) swab RT-PCR for clinical testing.

MethodsIndividuals presenting for molecular testing in two of seven lanes were offered the opportunity to also receive BinaxNOW testing. Dual AN swabs were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic children ([&le;] 18 years) and adults. BinaxNOW testing was performed in a testing pod with temperature/humidity monitoring. One individual performed testing and official result reporting for each test, but most tests had a second independent reading to assess inter-operator agreement. Positive BinaxNOW results were scored as faint, medium, or strong. Positive BinaxNOW results were reported to patients by phone and they were instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations.

ResultsOf 2482 participants, 1380 adults and 928 children had paired RT-PCR/BinaxNOW results and complete symptom data. 974/1380 (71%) adults and 829/928 (89%) children were asymptomatic. BinaxNOW had 96.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.0-99.3) sensitivity and 100% (98.6-100.0) specificity in adults within 7 days of symptoms, and 84.6% (65.1-95.6) sensitivity and 100% (94.5-100.0) specificity in children within 7 days of symptoms. Sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic adults were 70.2% (56.6-81.6) and 99.6% (98.9-99.9), respectively, and in asymptomatic children were 65.4% (55.6-74.4) and 99.0% (98.0-99.6), respectively. By cycle threshold (Ct) value cutoff, sensitivity in all subgroups combined (n=292 RT-PCR-positive individuals) was 99.3% with Ct [&le;]25, 95.8% with [&le;]30, and 81.2% with [&le;]35. Twelve false positive BinaxNOW results (out of 2308 tests) were observed; in all twelve, the test bands were faint but otherwise normal, and were noted by both readers. One invalid BinaxNOW result was identified. Inter-operator agreement (positive versus negative BinaxNOW result) was 100% (n = 2230/2230 double reads). Each operator was able to process 20 RDTs per hour. In a separate set of 30 specimens (from individuals with symptoms [&le;]7 days) run at temperatures below the manufacturers recommended range (46-58.5{degrees}F), sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity 95.2%.

ConclusionsBinaxNOW had very high specificity in both adults and children and very high sensitivity in newly symptomatic adults. Overall, 95.8% sensitivity was observed with Ct [&le;] 30. These data support public health recommendations for use of the BinaxNOW test in adults with symptoms for [&le;]7 days without RT-PCR confirmation. Excellent inter-operator agreement indicates that an individual can perform and read the BinaxNOW test alone. A skilled laboratorian can perform and read 20 tests per hour.

403,Serologic Surveillance and Phylogenetic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hospital Health Care Workers,"BACKGROUNDIt is unclear how, when and where health care workers (HCW) working in hospitals are infected with SARS-CoV-2.

METHODSProspective cohort study comprising 4-weekly measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and questionnaires from March to June 2020. We compared SARS-CoV-2 incidence between HCW working in Covid-19 patient care, HCW working in non-Covid-19 patient care and HCW not in patient care. Phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 samples from patients and HCW were performed to identify potential transmission clusters.

RESULTSWe included 801 HCW: 439 in the Covid-19 patient care group, 164 in the non-Covid-19 patient care group and 198 in the no patient care group. SARS-CoV-2 incidence was highest in HCW working in Covid-19 patient care (13.2%), as compared with HCW in non-Covid-19 patient care (6.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 4.3) and in HCW not working in patient care (3.6%, HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.6). Within the group of HCW caring for Covid-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was highest in HCW working on Covid-19 wards (25.7%), as compared with HCW working on intensive care units (7.1%, HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9 to 6.9), and HCW working in the emergency room (8.0%, HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 7.1). Phylogenetic analyses on Covid-19 wards identified multiple potential HCW-to-HCW transmission clusters while no patient-to-HCW transmission clusters were identified.

CONCLUSIONSHCW working on Covid-19 wards are at increased risk for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an important role for HCW-to-HCW transmission.

404,Epidemiological impact of prioritizing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination by antibody status: Mathematical modeling analyses,"BackgroundVaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, but their availability falls far short of global needs. This study aimed to investigate the impact of prioritizing available doses on the basis of recipient antibody status, that is by exposure status, using Qatar as an example.

MethodsVaccination impact was assessed under different scale-up scenarios using a deterministic meta-population mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression in the presence of vaccination.

ResultsFor a vaccine that protects against infection with an efficacy of 95%, half as many vaccinations were needed to avert one infection, disease outcome, or death by prioritizing antibody-negative individuals for vaccination. Prioritization by antibody status reduced incidence at a faster rate and led to faster elimination of infection and return to normalcy. Further prioritization by age group amplified the gains of prioritization by antibody status. Gains from prioritization by antibody status were largest in settings where the proportion of the population already infected at the commencement of vaccination was 30-60%, which is perhaps where most countries will be by the time vaccination programs are up and running. For a vaccine that only protects against disease and not infection, vaccine impact was reduced by half, whether this impact was measured in terms of averted infections or disease outcomes, but the relative gains from using antibody status to prioritize vaccination recipients were similar.

ConclusionsMajor health, societal, and economic gains can be achieved more quickly by prioritizing those who are antibody-negative while doses of the vaccine remain in short supply.",Houssein H.

406,Using excess deaths and testing statistics to improve estimates of COVID-19 mortalities,"Factors such as non-uniform definitions of mortality, uncertainty in disease prevalence, and biased sampling complicate the quantification of fatality during an epidemic. Regardless of the employed fatality measure, the infected population and the number of infection-caused deaths need to be consistently estimated for comparing mortality across regions. We combine historical and current mortality data, a statistical testing model, and an SIR epidemic model, to improve estimation of mortality. We find that the average excess death across the entire US is 13% higher than the number of reported COVID-19 deaths. In some areas, such as New York City, the number of weekly deaths is about eight times higher than in previous years. Other countries such as Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Spain exhibit excess deaths significantly higher than their reported COVID-19 deaths.

Here we investigated the impact of male sex and age by infecting adult male, aged male, and adult female ferrets with SARS-CoV-2. Aged male ferrets had a decrease in temperature which was accompanied by prolonged viral replication with increased pathology in the upper respiratory tract after infection. Transcriptome analysis of the nasal turbinates and lungs indicated that female ferrets had significant increases in interferon response genes (OASL, MX1, ISG15, etc.) on day 2 post infection which was delayed in aged males. In addition, genes associated with taste and smell such as RTP1, CHGA, and CHGA1 at later time points were upregulated in males but not in females.

409,Snake venom phospholipases A2 possess a strong virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and block the cell fusion mediated by spike glycoprotein interaction with the ACE2 receptor,"A new coronavirus was recently discovered and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the absence of specific therapeutic and prophylactic agents, the virus has infected almost hundred million people, of whom nearly two million have died from the viral disease COVID-19. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat requiring new therapeutic strategies. Among them, antiviral studies based on natural molecules are a promising approach. The superfamily of phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) consists of a large number of members that catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids at a specific position. Here we show that secreted PLA2s from the venom of various snakes protect to varying degrees the Vero E6 cells widely used for the replication of viruses with evident cytopathic action, from SARS-CoV-2 infection PLA2s showed low cytotoxicity to Vero E6 cells and the high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values ranged from 0.06 to 7.71 g/ml. Dimeric PLA2 HDP-2 from the viper Vipera nikolskii, as well as its catalytic and inhibitory subunits, had potent virucidal (neutralizing) activity against SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of the enzymatic activity of the catalytic subunit of dimeric PLA2 led to a significant decrease in antiviral activity. In addition, dimeric PLA2 inhibited cell-cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. These results suggest that snake PLA2s, in particular dimeric ones, are promising candidates for the development of antiviral drugs that target lipid bilayers of the viral envelope and may be good tools to study the interaction of viruses with host cell membranes.",Andrei E Siniavin; Maria A Nikiforova; Svetlana D Grinkina; Vladimir A Gushchin; Vladislav G Starkov; Alexey V Osipov; Victor I Tsetlin; Yuri N Utkin,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426042,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.12.426042,2021-01-12,2021-01-12,,False
410,Novel RT-ddPCR assays for determining the transcriptional profile of SARS-CoV-2,"The exact mechanism of coronavirus replication and transcription is not fully understood; however, a hallmark of coronavirus transcription is the generation of negative-sense RNA intermediates that serve as the templates for the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and an array of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) encompassing sequences arising from discontinuous transcription.

Existing PCR-based diagnostic assays for SAR-CoV-2 are qualitative or semi-quantitative and do not provide the resolution needed to assess the complex transcription dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of infection. We developed and validated a novel panel of specially designed SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR-based assays to map the viral transcription profile. Application of these assays to clinically relevant samples will enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription and may also inform the development of improved diagnostic tools and therapeutics.

411,Cerebrospinal fluid in COVID-19 neurological complications: no cytokine storm or neuroinflammation.,"BACKGROUNDNeurological complications occur in COVID-19. We aimed to examine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications and determine presence of neuroinflammatory changes implicated in pathogenesis.

METHODSCross-sectional study of CSF neuroinflammatory profiles from 18 COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications categorized by diagnosis (stroke, encephalopathy, headache) and illness severity (critical, severe, moderate, mild). COVID-19 CSF was compared with CSF from healthy, infectious and neuroinflammatory disorders and stroke controls (n=82). Cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IFN{gamma}, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A), inflammation and coagulation markers (high-sensitivity-C Reactive Protein [hsCRP], ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, Factor VIII) and neurofilament light chain (NF-L), were quantified. SARS-CoV2 RNA and SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgA antibodies in CSF were tested with RT-PCR and ELISA.

RESULTSCSF from COVID-19 subjects showed a paucity of neuroinflammatory changes, absence of pleocytosis or specific increases in pro-inflammatory markers or cytokines (IL-6, ferritin, or D-dimer). Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in CSF of COVID-19 subjects (77%) were observed despite no evidence of SARS-CoV2 viral RNA. A similar increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-12p70) and IL-10 in CSF of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 stroke subjects was observed compared to controls. CSF-NF-L was elevated in subjects with stroke and critical COVID-19. CSF-hsCRP was present almost exclusively in COVID-19 cases.

CONCLUSIONThe paucity of neuroinflammatory changes in CSF of COVID-19 subjects and lack of SARS-CoV2 RNA do not support the presumed neurovirulence of SARS-CoV2 or neuroinflammation in pathogenesis of neurological complications in COVID-19. Elevated CSF-NF-L indicates neuroaxonal injury in COVID-19 cases. The role of CSF SARS-CoV2 IgG antibodies is still undetermined.

412,Inhibitor Binding Modulates Protonation States in the Active Site of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,"The main protease (3CL Mpro) from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is an essential enzyme for viral replication with no human counterpart, making it an attractive drug target. Although drugs have been developed to inhibit the proteases from HIV, hepatitis C and other viruses, no such therapeutic is available to inhibit the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. To directly observe the protonation states in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and to elucidate their importance in inhibitor binding, we determined the structure of the enzyme in complex with the -ketoamide inhibitor telaprevir using neutron protein crystallography at near-physiological temperature. We compared protonation states in the inhibitor complex with those determined for a ligand-free neutron structure of Mpro. This comparison revealed that three active-site histidine residues (His41, His163 and His164) adapt to ligand binding, altering their protonation states to accommodate binding of telaprevir. We suggest that binding of other -ketoamide inhibitors can lead to the same protonation state changes of the active site histidine residues. Thus, by studying the role of active site protonation changes induced by inhibitors we provide crucial insights to help guide rational drug design, allowing precise tailoring of inhibitors to manipulate the electrostatic environment of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.",Daniel W.

413,Factors indicating intention to vaccinate with a COVID-19 vaccine among older U.S. Adults,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSThe success of vaccination efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic will require broad public uptake of immunization and highlights the importance of understanding factors associated with willingness to receive a vaccine.

METHODSAdults enrolled in the Heartline clinical study were invited to complete a COVID-19 vaccine assessment through the Heartline mobile application between November 6-20, 2020. Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm.

RESULTSAmong 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n=7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report.

CONCLUSIONSEven among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake. Education by health providers directed toward assuaging concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy can help improve vaccine acceptance among those less willing.

414,Indoor dust as a matrix for surveillance of COVID-19 outbreaks,"Ongoing disease surveillance is a critical tool to mitigate viral outbreaks, especially during a pandemic. Environmental monitoring has significant promise even following widespread vaccination among high-risk populations. The goal of this work is to demonstrate molecular SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in bulk floor dust and related samples as a proof-of-concept of a non-invasive environmental surveillance methodology for COVID-19 and potentially other viral diseases. Surface swab, passive sampler, and bulk floor dust samples were collected from rooms of individuals infected with COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 was measured with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and two digital PCR (dPCR) methods. Bulk dust samples had geometric mean concentration of 159 copies/mg-dust and ranged from non-detects to 23,049 copies/mg-dust detected using ddPCR. An average of 88% of bulk dust samples were positive for the virus among detection methods compared to 55% of surface swabs and fewer on the passive sampler (19% carpet, 29% polystyrene). In bulk dust, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 76%, 93%, and 97% of samples measured by qPCR, chip-based dPCR, and droplet dPCR respectively. Detectable viral RNA in the bulk vacuum bags did not measurably decay over 4 weeks, despite the application of a disinfectant before room cleaning. Future monitoring efforts should further evaluate RNA persistence and heterogeneity in dust. This study did not measure virus viability in dust or potential transmission associated with dust. Overall, this work demonstrates that bulk floor dust is a potentially useful matrix for long-term monitoring of viral disease outbreaks in high-risk populations and buildings.

ImportanceEnvironmental surveillance to assess pathogen presence within a community is proving to be a critical tool to protect public health, and it is especially relevant during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, environmental surveillance tools also allow for the detection of asymptomatic disease carriers and for routine monitoring of a large number of people as has been shown for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring. However, additional monitoring techniques are needed to screen for outbreaks in high-risk settings such as congregate care facilities. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in bulk floor dust collected from rooms housing infected individuals. This analysis suggests that dust may be a useful and efficient matrix for routine surveillance of viral disease outbreaks.",Nicole Renninger; Nicholas Nastasi; Ashleigh Bope; Samuel J.

415,"Viral mutation, contact rates and testing: a DCM study of fluctuations","This report considers three mechanisms that might underlie the course of the secondary peak of coronavirus infections in the United Kingdom. It considers: (i) fluctuations in transmission strength; (ii) seasonal fluctuations in contact rates and (iii) fluctuations in testing. Using dynamic causal modelling, we evaluated the contribution of all combinations of these three mechanisms using Bayesian model comparison. We found overwhelming evidence for the combination of all mechanisms, when explaining 16 types of data. Quantitatively, there was clear evidence for an increase in transmission strength of 57% over the past months (e.g., due to viral mutation), in the context of increased contact rates (e.g., rebound from national lockdowns) and increased test rates (e.g., due to the inclusion of lateral flow tests). Models with fluctuating transmission strength outperformed models with fluctuating contact rates. However, the best model included all three mechanisms suggesting that the resurgence during the second peak can be explained by an increase in effective contact rate that is the product of a rebound of contact rates following a national lockdown and increased transmission risk due to viral mutation.",Karl Friston; Anthony Costello; Guillaume Flandin; Adeel Razi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249520,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249520,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,True
416,Acute Metabolic Emergencies in Diabetes and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of case reports,"IntroductionCOVID-19 is associated with DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis), HHS (Hyperglycaemic Hyperosmolar State) and EDKA (Euglycaemic DKA). High mortality has been observed in COVID-19-related diabetic ketoacidosis; however, evidence is scarce.

Patients and MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted using EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar from January to December 2020 to identify all case reports describing DKA, HHS, and EDKA, in COVID-19 patients. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for case reports was used for quality assessment. Univariate and multivariate analysis assessed correlations of study origin, combined DKA/HHS, age, BMI, HbA1c, administered antidiabetics, comorbidities, symptoms onset, disease status, CRP, ferritin, d-dimers, glucose, osmolarity, pH, bicarbonates, ketones, lactates, {beta}-hydroxybutyric acid, anion gap, and acute kidney injury (AKI) with outcome.

ResultsFrom 312 identified publications, 41 including 71 cases analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 disease status 4 (P<0.001), AKI (P<0.001), pH [&le;]7.12 (P=0.032), and osmolarity [&ge;]324 (P=0.034), are all independently correlated with death.

417,Accurate Covid-19 prevalence measurement in the field,"BackgroundWrong Covid-19 prevalence measurement can cost lives or economic output. A number of countries offer random Covid-19 tests and report daily positivity rates. However, since virus testing has to be voluntary, all tests done in the field, even if supposedly random, suffer from selection bias, which is not limited to having a representative sample, and thus cannot be corrected by the usual methods. The issue is that people who feel they have symptoms (or other reasons to suspect they have Covid-19), are more likely to volunteer to get tested, and testing stations cannot readily correct this by oversampling.

MethodsWe used a controlled, incentivized online experiment with over 600 subjects of all ages in a European country.

ResultsPeople under 30 with symptoms are 1.532 times more likely to test when there is no waiting time, compared to those without symptoms. This figure increases to 2.882 when there is a short wait of 5-15 minutes; 4.423 with a 15-30 minute wait; 15.5 with a 30-60 minute wait and 38 with a 1-2 hour wait. The ratio for 30-50 year-olds rages between 1.517 for no wait and 16 for a 1-2 hour wait. For over 50-year-olds, the ratio ranges between 1.708 and 11.333.

However, prior studies of these medications as potentially reversible risk factors for COVID-19 have been conflicting. We performed a case-control study involving clinician-abstracted data from 900 health records across 3 US medical centers. We incorporated sociobehavioral predictors of infectious exposure using geomapping to publicly-available data. We found no evidence for an association between chronic acid suppression and incident COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI: 0.92-1.17, P=0.515). However, we identified several medical and social features as positive (Latinx ethnicity, BMI [&ge;] 30, dementia, public transportation use, month of the pandemic) and negative (female sex, concurrent solid tumor, alcohol use disorder) predictors of new-onset infection.

420,Proteomic and Metabolomic Investigation of COVID-19 Patients with Elevated Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase,"Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been established as a prognostic indicator given its differential expression in COVID-19 patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underneath remain poorly understood. In this study, 144 COVID-19 patients were enrolled to monitor the clinical and laboratory parameters over three weeks. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was shown elevated in the COVID-19 patients on admission and declined during the convalescence period, and its ability to classify patient severity outperformed other clinical indicators. A threshold of 247 U/L serum LDH on admission was determined for severity prognosis. Next, we classified a subset of 14 patients into high- and low-risk groups based on serum LDH expression and compared their quantitative serum proteomic and metabolomic differences. The results found COVID-19 patients with high serum LDH exhibited differentially expressed blood coagulation and immune responses including acute inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation, complement cascade, as well as multiple different metabolic responses including lipid metabolism, protein ubiquitination and pyruvate fermentation. Specifically, activation of hypoxia responses was highlighted in patients with high LDH expressions.

421,Atmospheric PM2.5 before and after Lockdown in relation to COVID-19 Evolution and daily Viral Counts: Could Viral Natural Selection have occurred due to changes in the Airborne Pollutant PM2.5 acting as a Vector for SARS-CoV-2?,"BackgroundGenes coding for SARS-CoV-2 have been detected on the microscopic airborne pollutant particulate matter, which has been suggested as a vector for COVID-19 transmission. Lockdown in China has been shown to be associated with significant reduction in pollution including the particulate matter component which coincided with the appearance of a viral mutant (Clade G) which steadily displaced the original Clade D after lockdown. The reason why Clade G developed a fitness advantage is as yet unknown. This paper examines the possible role of airborne particulate matter PM2.5 as selective pressure determining viral Clade predominance and further shedding light on the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

MethodsThe average levels of PM2.5 of a number of cities were obtained from the Air Quality Index (AQI), a real-time assessment of atmospheric pollution. The daily average PM2.5 levels were assessed between January 23rd and April 29th 2020 determined by the timeline when viral counts in Beijing and other cities were available. Daily viral counts of Clades D and G were available starting from the 12th February as determined by the scientific literature published in August 2020. The cities chosen were Beijing, Sheffield, Nottingham, Sydney and Cambridge because of their substantially elevated viral counts compared to other cities. Cities as opposed to vaster areas/nations were chosen as PM2.5 levels vary across regions and countries.

ResultsFor the time period assessed, the Beijing PM2.5 pattern initiated with highly elevated mean PM2.5 levels of 155.8{micro}g/m3 (SD+/-73.6) during high viral counts, followed by 82.1{micro}g/m3 (SD+/-44.9) (p<0.04) when the viral counts decreased. In all the other cities assessed, the pattern differed whereby the PM2.5 levels increased significantly over the preceding baseline contemporaneously with the viral count rise. The changes in these cities PM2.5 levels were on average 31.5{micro}g/m3 before viral counts rose and 56.35{micro}g/m3 contemporaneous with viral count rise. The average levels of PM2.5 in these cities started to decrease one week after lockdown to 46{micro}g/m3 when measured over 2 weeks post-lockdown.

As regards the viral counts from data retrieved from Beijing, the latter part of the bell-shaped curve and a subsequent smaller curve of the viral count was available for evaluation. The average viral count for Clade D in Beijing was 11.1(SD+/-13.5) followed by a mean viral count for Clade G was 13.8(SD+/-9.2). Conversely in all the other cities besides Beijing, the viral counts averaged 45.8 for Clade D and 161 for Clade G. The variation in viral counts between cities suggests the strong possibility of variation in the availability of sampling between cities.

The newer variant, Clade G demonstrated viral counts initially appearing in mid-February in Beijing to later displace Clade D as the dominant viral Clade. The appearance of Clade G coincided with the decreasing gradient of PM2.5 levels. A number of significant correlations were obtained between PM2.5 levels and the viral count in all the cities reviewed.

ConclusionCOVID-19 viral counts appear to increase concomitant with increasing PM2.5 levels. Viral counts of both Clades correlated differentially with PM2.5 levels in all the cities assessed. The significantly highly elevated PM2.5 levels in Beijing resulted in correlating mainly with Clade D, however Clade G began to appear with decreasing PM2.5 levels, suggesting the beginnings for the initial SARS-CoV-2 Clade evolution. Clade G, the newer variant was able to flourish at lower levels of PM2.5 than Clade D. Clade G may possibly have utilized other sources of particulate matter as a viral vector, such as that derived from tobacco smoking, whereby 66% of Chinese males are smokers and 70% of the Chinese non-smoking population are exposed to 2nd hand smoking.",Yves Muscat Baron,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249548,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.10.21249548,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,True
422,Robotic RNA extraction for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using saliva samples,"Saliva is an attractive specimen type for asymptomatic surveillance of COVID-19 in large populations due to its ease of collection and its demonstrated utility for detecting RNA from SARS-CoV-2. Multiple saliva-based viral detection protocols use a direct-to-RT-qPCR approach that eliminates nucleic acid extraction but can reduce viral RNA detection sensitivity. To improve test sensitivity while maintaining speed, we developed a robotic nucleic acid extraction method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples with high throughput. Using this assay, the Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (IGI-FAST) research study on the UC Berkeley campus conducted 11,971 tests on supervised self-collected saliva samples and identified rare positive specimens containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA during a time of low infection prevalence. In an attempt to increase testing capacity, we further adapted our robotic extraction assay to process pooled saliva samples. We also benchmarked our assay against the gold standard, nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Finally, we designed and validated a RT-qPCR test suitable for saliva self-collection.

We analyzed 68,557 single-nucleus transcriptomes from three brain regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medulla oblongata and choroid plexus) and identified an increased proportion of stromal cells and monocytes in the choroid plexus of COVID-19 patients. Differential gene expression, pseudo-temporal trajectory and gene regulatory network analyses revealed microglial transcriptome perturbations, mediating a range of biological processes, including cellular activation, mobility and phagocytosis. Quantification of viral spike S1 protein and SARS-CoV-2 transcripts did not support the notion of brain tropism.

Extra-pulmonary pathologies and immunological parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection remained undefined in GSH. Using in silico modelling, we identified the similarities between human and hamster angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) that bind to receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S1 fragment of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection led to lung pathologies, and cardiovascular complications (CVC) marked by interstitial coronary fibrosis and acute inflammatory response. Serum lipidomic and metabolomic profile of SARS-CoV-2-infected GSH revealed changes in serum triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and alterations in metabolites that correlated with Covid19. Together, we propose GSH as an animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and its therapy associated with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary pathologies.

426,Hypoxia reduces cell attachment of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by modulating the expression of ACE2 and heparan sulfate,"A main clinical parameter of Covid-19 pathophysiology is hypoxia. Here we show that hypoxia decreases the attachment of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S1 subunit (S1) of the spike protein to epithelial cells. In Vero E6 cells, hypoxia reduces the protein levels of ACE2, which might in part explain the observed reduction of the infection rate. However, hypoxia also inhibits the binding of the spike to human lung epithelial cells lacking ACE2 expression, indicating that hypoxia modulates the expression of additional binding partners of SARS-CoV-2. We show that hypoxia also decreases the total cell surface levels of heparan sulfate, a known attachment receptor of SARS-CoV-2, by reducing the expression of syndecan-1 and syndecan3, the main proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate. Our study indicates that hypoxia acts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the hypoxia signaling pathway might offer therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of Covid-19.",Endika Prieto-Fernandez; Leire Egia-Mendikute; Laura Vila-Vecilla; So Young Lee; Alexandre Bosch; Adrian Barreira-Manrique; Ana Garcia del Rio; Asier Antonana-Vildosola; Borja Jimenez-Lasheras; Asis Palazon,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.426021,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.426021,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,False

While RBD-directed antibodies have been extensively studied, far less is known about NTD-directed antibodies. Here we report cryo-EM and crystal structures for seven potent NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies in complex with spike or isolated NTD. These structures defined several antibody classes, with at least one observed in multiple convalescent donors. The structures revealed all seven antibodies to target a common surface, bordered by glycans N17, N74, N122, and N149. This site - formed primarily by a mobile {beta}-hairpin and several flexible loops - was highly electropositive, located at the periphery of the spike, and the largest glycan-free surface of NTD facing away from the viral membrane.

428,Molecular Dynamics Analysis of a Flexible Loop at the Binding Interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor-Binding Domain,"Since the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, considerable effort has been spent characterizing the interaction between the Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This has provided a detailed picture of the end point structure of the RBD-ACE2 binding event, but what remains to be elucidated is the conformation and dynamics of the RBD prior to its interaction with ACE2. In this work we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to probe the flexibility and conformational ensemble of the unbound state of the receptor-binding domain from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We have found that the unbound RBD has a localized region of dynamic flexibility in Loop 3 and that mutations identified during the COVID-19 pandemic in Loop 3 do not affect this flexibility. We use a loop-modeling protocol to generate and simulate novel conformations of the CoV2-RBD Loop 3 region that sample conformational space beyond the ACE2 bound crystal structure. This has allowed for the identification of interesting substates of the unbound RBD that are lower energy than the ACE2-bound conformation, and that block key residues along the ACE2 binding interface. These novel unbound substates may represent new targets for therapeutic design.",Jonathan K Williams; Baifan Wang; Andrew Sam; Cody L Hoop; David A Case; Jean Baum,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425965,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425965,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,False
429,Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy of an Intranasal Live-attenuated Vaccine Against SARS-CoV-2 in Preclinical Animal Models,"The global deployment of an effective and safe vaccine is currently a public health priority to curtail the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we evaluated a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based intranasal vectored-vaccine in mice and hamsters for its immunogenicity, safety and protective efficacy in challenge studies with SARS-CoV-2. The recombinant (r)NDV-S vaccine expressing spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 administrated via intranasal route in mice induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG2a antibodies and T cell-mediated immunity. Hamsters vaccinated with two doses of vaccine showed complete protection from clinical disease including lung infection, inflammation, and pathological lesions after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Importantly, a single or double dose of intranasal rNDV-S vaccine completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 shedding in nasal turbinate and lungs within 4 days of vaccine administration in hamsters. Taken together, intranasal administration of rNDV-S has the potential to control infection at the site of inoculation, which should prevent both the clinical disease and transmission to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Jun-Guy Park; Fatai S.

430,Modular basis for potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by a prevalent VH1-2-derived antibody class,"Antibodies with heavy chains that derive from the VH1-2 gene constitute some of the most potent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies yet identified. To provide insight into whether these genetic similarities inform common modes of recognition, we determined structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with three VH1-2-derived antibodies: 2-15, 2-43, and H4. All three utilized VH1-2-encoded motifs to recognize the receptor-binding domain (RBD), with heavy chain N53I enhancing binding and light chain tyrosines recognizing F486RBD. Despite these similarities, class members bound both RBD-up and -down conformations of the spike, with a subset of antibodies utilizing elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343 on a neighboring RBD - a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD separation of up to 12 [A]. The VH1-2-antibody class thus utilizes modular recognition encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with VH-gene component specifying recognition of RBD and CDRH3 component specifying quaternary interactions.

431,Immunogenicity and efficacy of the COVID-19 candidate vector vaccine MVA SARS 2 S in preclinical vaccination,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as the infectious agent causing the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dramatic consequences for global human health and economics. Previously, we reached clinical evaluation with our vector vaccine based on vaccinia virus MVA against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which causes an infection in humans similar to SARS and COVID-19. Here, we describe the construction and preclinical characterization of a recombinant MVA expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-SARS-2-S). Genetic stability and growth characteristics of MVA-SARS-2-S, plus its robust synthesis of S antigen, make it a suitable candidate vaccine for industrial scale production. Vaccinated mice produced S antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and serum antibodies binding to S glycoprotein that neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Prime-boost vaccination with MVA-SARS-2-S protected mice sensitized with a human ACE2-expressing adenovirus from SARS-CoV-2 infection. MVA-SARS-2-S is currently being investigated in a phase I clinical trial as aspirant for developing a safe and efficacious vaccine against COVID-19.

Significance StatementThe highly attenuated vaccinia virus MVA is licensed as smallpox vaccine, and as vector it is a component of the approved Adenovirus-MVA-based prime-boost vaccine against Ebola virus disease. Here we provide results from testing the COVID-19 candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S, a poxvirus-based vector vaccine that proceeded to clinical evaluation. When administered by intramuscular inoculation, MVA-SARS-2-S expresses and safely delivers the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, inducing balanced SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity, and protective efficacy in vaccinated mice. Substantial clinical experience has already been gained with MVA vectors using homologous and heterologous prime-boost applications, including the immunization of children and immunocompromised individuals. Thus, MVA-SARS-2-S represents an important resource for developing further optimized COVID-19 vaccines.",Alina Tscherne; Jan Hendrik Schwarz; Cornelius Rohde; Alexandra Kupke; Georgia Kalodimou; Leonard Limpinsel; Nisreen M.A. Okba; Berislav Bosnjak; Inga Sandrock; Sandro Halwe; Lucie Sauerhering; Katrin Printz; Liangliang Nan; Elke Duell; Sylvia Jany; Astrid Freudenstein; Joerg Schmidt; Anke Werner; Michelle Gellhorn; Michael Kluever; Wolfgang Guggemos; Michael Seilmaier; Clemens Wendtner; Reinhold Foerster; Bart Haagmans; Stephan Becker; Gerd Sutter; Asisa Volz,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.426032,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.426032,2021-01-11,2021-01-11,,False

These functions can be both beneficial (by clearing pathogens) and/or detrimental (by inducing inflammation). We tested the possibility that qualitative differences in SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody-mediated innate immune functions contribute to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. We found that antibodies from hospitalized COVID-19 patients elicited higher ADCD but lower ADCP compared to antibodies from non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Consistently, higher ADCD was associated with higher systemic inflammation during COVID-19.

Here we investigate whether intranasally administered ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 reduces shedding, using a SARS-CoV-2 virus with the D614G mutation in the spike protein. Viral load in swabs obtained from intranasally vaccinated hamsters was significantly decreased compared to controls and no viral RNA or infectious virus was found in lung tissue, both in a direct challenge and a transmission model. Intranasal vaccination of rhesus macaques resulted in reduced shedding and a reduction in viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage and lower respiratory tract tissue.

434,Impact of South African 501.V2 Variant on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Infectivity and Neutralization: A Structure-based Computational Assessment,"MotivationThe SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging from South Africa (501.V2) and the UK (B.1.1.7) necessitate rapid assessment of the effects of the corresponding amino acid substitutions in the spike (S) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the variants on the interactions with the human ACE2 receptor and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reported earlier to neutralize the spike.

ResultsMolecular modeling and simulations reveal that N501Y, shared by both variants, increases ACE2 binding affinity, and may impact the collective dynamics of the ACE2-RBD complex, occupying a central hinge site that modulates the overall dynamics of the complex. In contrast, the substitutions K417N and E484K in the South African variant 501.V2 would reduce the ACE2-binding affinity by abolishing two interfacial salt bridges that facilitate RBD binding to ACE2, K417(S)-D30(ACE2) and E484 (S)-K31(ACE2). These two mutations may thus be more than compensating the attractive effect induced by N501Y, overall resulting in an ACE2-binding affinity comparable to that of the wildtype RBD. Further analysis of the impact of these mutations on the interactions with mAbs targeting the spike indicate that the substitutions K417N and E484K may also abolish the salt bridges between the spike and selected mAbs, such as REGN10933, BD23, H11_H4, and C105, thus reducing the binding affinity and effectiveness of these mAbs.

435,Microsecond simulation unravel the structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (residues 1242-1273),"Spike protein of human coronaviruses has been a vital drug and vaccine target. The multifunctionality of this protein including host receptor binding and apoptosis has been proved in several coronaviruses. It also interacts with other viral proteins such as membrane (M) protein through its C-terminal domain. The specific dibasic motif signal present in cytosolic region at C-terminal of spike protein helps it to localize within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the structural conformation of cytosolic region is not known in SARS-CoV-2 using which it interacts with other proteins and transporting vesicles. Therefore, we have demonstrated the conformation of cytosolic region and its dynamics through computer simulations up to microsecond timescale using OPLS and CHARMM forcefields. The simulations have revealed the unstructured conformation of cytosolic region (residues 1242-1273). Also, in temperature dependent replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations it has shown to form secondary structures.

436,The hyperlipidaemic drug fenofibrate significantly reduces infection by SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a significant number of fatalities and worldwide disruption. To identify drugs to repurpose to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, we established a screen to measure dimerization of ACE2, the primary receptor for the virus. This screen identified fenofibric acid, the active metabolite of fenofibrate. Fenofibric acid also destabilized the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and inhibited RBD binding to ACE2 in ELISA and whole cell binding assays. Fenofibrate and fenofibric acid were tested by two independent laboratories measuring infection of cultured Vero cells using two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. In both settings at drug concentrations which are clinically achievable, fenofibrate and fenofibric acid reduced viral infection by up to 70%. Together with its extensive history of clinical use and its relatively good safety profile, these studies identify fenofibrate as a potential therapeutic agent requiring urgent clinical evaluation to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

438,The Conundrum of Giglio Island: unraveling the dynamics of an apparent resistance to COVID-19. A descriptive study,"ObjectivesDespite an extensive risk of exposure to COVID-19, the residents of Giglio Island, Italy, did not develop any symptom of SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to characterize the nature of exposure and to describe the local population dynamics underlying its apparent resistance to COVID-19.

MethodsWe conducted seroprevalence screening from April 29 to May 3, 2020 across the three main settlements on the island. We invited the adult resident population, present on the island to undergo testing by rapid serologic assay and to provide a sample of saliva for molecular validation. We monitored the participation through the official municipality residents list. Serologic testing was performed using a COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test while molecular analyses were carried out by Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene).

ResultsA total of 634 residents out of 748 (84.8%) present at the time, and 89 non-residents underwent serological testing. 364 males and 359 females with a median age of 58.5 years. The serological screening identified one positive, asymptomatic subject. The Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests did not yield any positive result.

ConclusionDespite extensive exposure to SARS-CoV-2, only one new asymptomatic infection occurred in this population. This may be due to unknown protective factors or chance.

439,Cholinergic and lipid mediators crosstalk in Covid-19 and the impact of glucocorticoid therapy,"Cytokine storms and hyperinflammation, potentially controlled by glucocorticoids, occur in COVID-19; the roles of lipid mediators and acetylcholine (ACh) and how glucocorticoid therapy affects their release in Covid-19 remain unclear. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from SARS-CoV-2- and non-SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects were collected for metabolomic/lipidomic, cytokines, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and ACh, and CD14 and CD36-expressing monocyte/macrophage subpopulation analyses. Transcriptome reanalysis of pulmonary biopsies was performed by assessing coexpression, differential expression, and biological networks. Correlations of lipid mediators, sCD14, and ACh with glucocorticoid treatment were evaluated. This study enrolled 190 participants with Covid-19 at different disease stages, 13 hospitalized non-Covid-19 patients, and 39 healthy-participants. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased blood levels of arachidonic acid (AA), 5-HETE, 11-HETE, sCD14, and ACh but decreased monocyte CD14 and CD36 expression. 5-HETE, 11-HETE, cytokines, ACh, and neutrophils were higher in BAL than in circulation (fold-change for 5-HETE 389.0; 11-HETE 13.6; ACh 18.7, neutrophil 177.5, respectively). Only AA was higher in circulation than in BAL samples (fold-change 7.7). Results were considered significant at P<0.05, 95%CI. Transcriptome data revealed a unique gene expression profile associated with AA, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, ACh, and their receptors in Covid-19. Glucocorticoid treatment in severe/critical cases lowered ACh without impacting disease outcome. We first report that pulmonary inflammation and the worst outcomes in Covid-19 are associated with high levels of ACh and lipid mediators.

440,The Effect of Temperature on Covid-19 Confirmed Cases: Evidence from US Counties,"This paper studies the effect of air temperature on the transmission of COVID-19 in the U.S. using daily observations across counties. This study uses various ordinary least squares (OLS) models with a comprehensive set of fixed effects to overcome unobserved heterogeneity issues across counties as well as the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators as dynamic models to address endogeneity issue. Our main results indicate that an increase of one degree in temperature is associated with a reduction of 0.041 cases per 100,000 population at the county-level. We run several robustness tests and all the models confirm the impact of temperature on COVID-19 confirmed new cases. These results help policymakers and economists in optimizing decisions and investments to reduce COVID- 19 new cases.

ObjectiveTo determine the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-{beta}-1a, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir for improving the clinical, virological outcomes in COVID-19 inpatients.

DesignOpen-label, randomized, adaptive, controlled trial.

SettingMulti-center trial with patients from France.

Participants583 COVID-19 inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support

InterventionStandard of care (SoC, control), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir every 12h for 14 days), SoC plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus IFN-{beta}-1a (44 g of subcutaneous IFN-{beta}-1a on days 1, 3, and 6), SoC plus hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on day 1 then 400 mg once daily for 9 days) or SoC plus remdesivir (200 mg intravenously on day 1 then 100 mg once-daily for hospitalization duration or 10 days).

MeasurementsThe primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 quantification in respiratory specimens and safety analyses.

ResultsAdjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for the WHO 7-point ordinal scale were not in favor of investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, aOR 0.83, 95%CI, 0.55 to 1.26, P=0.39; lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-{beta}-1a versus control, aOR 0.69, 95%CI, 0.45 to 1.04, P=0.08; hydroxychloroquine versus control, aOR 0.93, 95%CI, 0.62 to 1.41, P=0.75. No significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract was evidenced. Lopinavir/ritonavir-containing treatments were significantly associated with more SAE.

LimitationsNot a placebo-controlled, no anti-inflammatory agents tested.

ConclusionNo improvement of the clinical status at day 15 nor SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in respiratory tract specimens by studied drugs. This comforts the recent Solidarity findings.

442,Ivermectin as a potential treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19: A double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial,"ObjectiveIvermectin has been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19.This randomised control trial was conducted to test the efficacy of Ivermectin in the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19.

DesignParallel, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial Setting: A tertiary care dedicated COVID-19 hospital in Bihar, India

ParticipantsAdult patients (> 18 years) admitted with mild to moderate COVID 19 disease (saturation > 90% on room air, respiratory rate < 30 and no features of shock) with no contraindications to ivermectin and willing to participate in the study

InterventionPatients in the intervention arm were given ivermectin 12 mg on day 1 and day 2 of admission. Patients in the placebo arm were given identical looking placebo tablets. Rest of the treatment was continued as per the existing protocol and the clinical judgment of the treating teams.

Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome measure was a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 6 of admission. The secondary outcome measures were symptom status on day 6, discharge status on day 10, admission to ICU, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality.

ResultsA total of 115 patients were enrolled for the study of which 112 were included in the final analysis. Of them, 55 were randomised to the intervention arm while 57 were randomised to the placebo arm. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the two arms. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 between the two groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the two groups in most of the secondary outcome measures, viz. symptom status on day 6, discharge status on day 10, admission to ICU, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. However, while there was no in-hospital mortality in the intervention arm, there were 4 deaths in the placebo arm. As a result, all patients in the intervention arm (n=56) were successfully discharged as compared to 93.1% (n=54/58) in the placebo arm (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2, p=0.019).

ConclusionThere was no difference in the primary outcome i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 of admission with the use of ivermectin. However, a significantly higher proportion of patients were discharged alive from the hospital when they received ivermectin.

Strengths and Limitations of the StudyO_LIThis study was randomised and double blind, thereby minimizing the chance of bias.
C_LIO_LIAll outcome measures except symptom status on day 6 were objective and placebo control was used for comparison.
C_LIO_LIOnly single repeat RT-PCR was done. So median time to viral clearance in the two groups could not be calculated.
C_LIO_LISevere cases were not included in the study.

We have developed MassMark, a novel and highly scalable multiplex method that employs next generation sequencing for high-throughput, accurate and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, while minimizing handling complexity and resources by utilizing a serial pooling strategy to accommodate over 9,000 samples per workflow. Analytical validation showed that MassMark was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA down to a level of 100 copies per reaction. We evaluated the clinical performance of MassMark in a simulated screening testing with 22 characterized samples from three different sources (nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs and saliva), comprising of 12 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with mid to late Ct values (range: 22.98-32.72) and 10 negative samples. There was one false negative and no false positives, giving an overall sensitivity and specificity of 91.67% and 100% respectively, when compared against an optimized RT-PCR test with a target size within 70 bp (CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel3).",Kao Chin Ngeow; Chao Xie; Alvin Kuo Jing Teo; Li Yang Hsu; Min-Han Tan; Yukti Choudhury,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20249017,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.20249017,2021-01-09,2021-01-09,,True
444,COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers of a large COVID Hospital in Rome reveals strengths and limits of two different serological tests,"In several hospitals worldwide, healthcare workers are currently at the forefront against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli (FPG) IRCCS has been enlisted as a COVID hospital, healthcare workers deployed to COVID wards were separated from those with limited or no exposure, whereas administrative staff was destined to work-from-home.

Between June 4 and July 3 2020, an investigation was carried out to evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among employees of the FPG using point-of-care (POC) and venous blood tests. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were determined with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal/oropharyngeal swabs as gold standard.

Four thousand, seven hundred seventy-seven participants were enrolled. Seroprevalence was 3.66% using the POC test and 1.19% using venous blood test, with a significant difference between the two (p < 0.05).

POC sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 63.64% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.20% to 65.04%) and 96.64% (95% CI: 96.05% to 97.13%), while those of the venous blood test were, respectively, 78.79% (95% CI: 77.58% to 79.94%) and 99.36% (95% CI: 99.07% to 99.55%). Among low-risk population, point-of-cares predictive values were 58.33% (positive) and 98.23% (negative) whereas venous blood tests were 92.86% (positive) and 98.53% (negative). In conclusion, point-of-care tests have low diagnostic accuracy, while venous blood tests seem to show an overall poor reliability.",Giuseppe Vetrugno; Daniele Ignazio La Milia; Floriana D'Ambrosio; Marcello Di Pumpo; Roberta Pastorino; Stefania Boccia; Rosalba Ricci; Fabio De-Giorgio; Michela Cicconi; Federica Foti; Domenico Pascucci; Francesco Castrini; Elettra Carini; Andrea Cambieri; Maria Elena D'Alfonso; Gennaro Capalbo; Massimo Fantoni; Umberto Moscato; Domenico Staiti; Francesco Maria De Simone; Filippo Berloco; Maurizio Zega; Paola Cattani; Brunella Posteraro; Maurizio Sanguinetti; Patrizia Laurenti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249445,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249445,2021-01-09,2021-01-09,,True
445,Levels of SARS-CoV-2 population exposure are considerably higher than suggested by seroprevalence surveys,"Accurate knowledge of levels of prior population exposure will inform preparedness plans for subsequent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves and vaccination strategies. Serological studies can be used to estimate levels of past exposure and thus position populations in their epidemic timeline. To circumvent biases introduced by decaying antibody titers over time, population exposure estimation methods should account for seroreversion. Here, we present a new method that combines multiple datasets (serology, mortality, and virus positivity ratios) to estimate seroreversion time and infection fatality ratios and simultaneously infer population exposure levels. The results indicate that the average time to seroreversion is five months, meaning that true exposure may be more than double the current seroprevalence levels reported for several regions of England.

Existence of a forward bifurcation point is presented by deriving conditions in terms of parameters for the existence of disease free and endemic equilibrium points. The significance of having two additional compartments, viz., protective and hospital quarantine compartments, is then illustrated via numerical simulations. From the analysis and results, it is observed that, by properly selecting transfer functions to place exposed and infected individuals in protective and hospital quarantine compartments, respectively, and with apt governmental action, it is possible to contain the COVID-19 spread effectively. Finally, the capability of the proposed model in predicting/representing the COVID-19 dynamics is presented by comparing with real-time data.",Rohith G.,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249467,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249467,2021-01-09,2021-01-09,,True

Thus, there is an increased need for genomic and epidemiological surveillance in order to detect the strains and estimate their abundances. Here, we report a genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in 48 raw wastewater samples collected from three wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland between July 9 and December 21, 2020. We find evidence for the presence of several mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages in some of the samples, including co-occurrences of up to three B.1.1.7 signature mutations on the same amplicon in four samples from Lausanne and one sample from a Swiss ski resort dated December 9 - 21. These findings suggest that the B.1.1.7 strain could be detected by mid December, two weeks before its first verification in a patient sample from Switzerland.

448,"Efficacy of propolis as an adjunct treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a randomized, controlled clinical trial","Among candidate treatment options for COVID-19, propolis, produced by honey bees from bioactive plant exudates, has shown potential against viral targets and has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, with a standardized propolis product (EPP-AF) on hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. Patients received standard care plus propolis at an oral dose of 400mg/day (n=40) or 800mg/day (n=42) for seven days, or standard care alone (n=42). Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Time in the hospital after intervention was significantly shortened in both propolis groups compared to the controls; median 7 days with 400mg/day and 6 days with 800mg/day, versus 12 days for standard care alone. Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. With the higher dose, significantly fewer patients developed acute kidney injury than in the controls (2 versus 10 of 42 patients). Propolis as an adjunct treatment was safe and reduced hospitalization time.

449,The importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout,"The promise of efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is fulfilled and vaccination campaigns are starting worldwide. However, the fight against the pandemic is far from over. Here, we propose an age-structured compartmental model to study the interplay of disease transmission, vaccines rollout, and behavioural dynamics. We investigate, via in-silico simulations, individual and societal behavioural changes, possibly induced by the start of the vaccination campaigns, and manifested as a relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We calibrate the model using real epidemiological data for three different countries: Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. We explore different vaccination rollout speeds, prioritization strategies, and vaccine efficacy as well as multiple behavioural responses. Our findings suggest that early relaxation of safe behaviours can jeopardize the benefits brought by the vaccine in the short term: a fast vaccine distribution and policies aimed at keeping high compliance of individual safe behaviours are key to mitigate disease resurgence.",Nicolò Gozzi; Paolo Bajardi; Nicola Perra,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249480,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.09.21249480,2021-01-09,2021-01-09,,True
450,Women in Health Care Experiencing Occupational Stress and Burnout during COVID-19: A Review,"ContextCOVID-19 has had an unprecedent impact on physicians, nurses, and other health professionals around the world, and a serious health care burnout crisis is emerging as a result of this pandemic.

ObjectivesWe aim to identify the causes of occupational stress and burnout in women in medicine, nursing, and other health professions during the COVID-19 pandemic and interventions that can support female health professionals deal with this crisis through a rapid review.

MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC from December 2019 through September 30, 2020. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO and is available online. We selected all empirical studies that discussed stress and burnout in women health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ResultsThe literature search identified 6148 citations. A review of abstracts led to the retrieval of 721 full-text articles for assessment, of which 47 articles were included for review. Our findings show that concerns of safety (65%), staff and resource adequacy (43%), workload and compensation (37%), job roles and security (41%) appeared as common triggers of stress in the literature.

451,Deep learning-based detection of COVID-19 using wearables data,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that is primarily diagnosed using laboratory tests, which are frequently not administered until after symptom onset. However, SARS-CoV-2 is contagious multiple days before symptom onset and diagnosis, thus enhancing its transmission through the population.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, we collected 15 seconds to one-minute heart rate and steps interval data from Fitbit devices during the COVID-19 period (February 2020 until June 2020). Resting heart rate was computed by selecting the heart rate intervals where steps were zero for 12 minutes ahead of an interrogated time point. Data for each participant was divided into train or baseline by taking the days before the non-infectious period and test data by taking the days during the COVID-19 infectious period. Data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training days. Here, we developed a deep learning approach based on a Long Short-Term Memory Networks-based autoencoder, called LAAD, to predict COVID-19 infection by detecting abnormal resting heart rate in test data relative to the users baseline.

FindingsWe detected an abnormal resting heart rate during the period of viral infection (7 days before the symptom onset and 21 days after) in 92% (23 out of 25 cases) of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. In 56% (14) of cases, LAAD detection identified cases in their pre-symptomatic phase whereas 36% (9 cases) were detected after the onset of symptoms with an average precision score of 0{middle dot}91 (SD 0{middle dot}13, 95% CI 0{middle dot}854-0{middle dot}967), a recall score of 0{middle dot}36 (0{middle dot}295, 0{middle dot}232-0{middle dot}487), and a F-beta score of 0{middle dot}79 (0{middle dot}226, 0{middle dot}693-0{middle dot}888). In COVID-19 positive patients, abnormal RHR patterns start 5 days before symptom onset (6{middle dot}9 days in pre-symptomatic cases and 1{middle dot}9 days later in post-symptomatic cases). COVID-19+ patients have longer abnormal resting heart rate periods (89 hours or 3{middle dot}7 days) as compared to healthy individuals (25 hours or 1{middle dot}1 days).

InterpretationThese findings show that deep learning neural networks and wearables data are an effective method for the early detection of COVID-19 infection. Additional validation data will help guide the use of this and similar techniques in real-world infection surveillance and isolation policies to reduce transmission and end the pandemic.

FundingThis work was supported by NIH grants and gifts from the Flu Lab, as well as departmental funding from the Stanford Genetics department. The Google Cloud Platform costs were covered by Google for Education academic research and COVID-19 grant awards.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSCOVID-19 resulted in up to 1{middle dot}7 million deaths worldwide in 2020. COVID-19 detection using laboratory tests is usually performed after symptom onset. This delay can allow the spread of viral infection and can cause outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar for research articles published in English up to Dec 1, 2020, using common search terms including ""COVID-19 and wearables"", ""Resting heart rate and viral infection"", ""Resting heart rate and COVID-19"", ""machine learning and COVID-19"" and ""deep-learning and COVID-19"". Previous studies have attempted to use an elevated resting heart rate as an indicator of viral infection. Although these studies have investigated the early prediction of COVID-19 using resting heart rate and other wearables data, studies to investigate a deep learning-based prediction model with performance evaluation metrics at the user level has not been reported.

Added value of this studyIn this study, we created a deep-learning system that used wearables data such as abnormal resting heart rate to predict COVID-19 before the symptom onset. The deep-learning system was created using retrospective time-series datasets collected from 25 COVID-19+ patients, 11 non-COVID-19, and 70 healthy individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first deep-learning model to identify an early viral infection using wearables data at the user level. This study also greatly extends our previous phase-1 study and factors unpredictable behavior and time-series nature of the data, limited data size, and lack of data labels to evaluate performance metrics. The use of a real-time version of this model using more data along with user feedback may help to scale early detection as the number of patients with COVID-19 continues to grow.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn the future, wearable devices may provide high-resolution sleep, temperature, saturated oxygen, respiration rate, and electrocardiogram, which could be used to further characterize an individuals baseline and improve the deep-learning model performance for infectious disease detection. Using multi-sensor data with a real-time deep-learning model has the potential to alert individuals of illness prior to symptom onset and may greatly reduce the viral spread.",Gireesh K Bogu; Michael P Snyder,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249474,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249474,2021-01-09,2021-01-09,,True

ObjectiveTo assess whether chest Computed Tomography (CT) of COVID-19 pneumonia has an incremental role in predicting patients admission to ICU.

MethodsWe performed volumetric and texture analysis of the areas of the affected lung in CT of 115 outpatients with COVID-19 infection presenting to the Emergency Room with dyspnea and unresponsive hypoxyemia. Admission blood laboratory including lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and C-Reactive Protein and the ratio between the arterial partial pressure of oxygen and inspired oxygen were collected. By calculating the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC), we compared the performance of blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone and combined with the CT features in two hybrid models (Hybrid radiological and Hybrid radiomics)for predicting ICU admission. Following a machine learning approach, 63 patients were allocated to the training and 52 to the validation set.

Measurements and Main ResultsTwenty-nine (25%) of patients were admitted to ICU. The Hybrid radiological model comprising the lung %consolidation performed significantly (p=0.04) better in predicting ICU admission in the validation (AUC=0.82; 95%Confidence Interval 0.68-0.95) set than the blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone (AUC=0.71; 95%Confidence Interval 0.56-0.86).

453,"Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of COVID-19, co-reporting of common outcomes from the PAN-COVID and AAP SONPM registry","BackgroundFew large, cohort studies report data on individuals maternal, fetal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. We report outcomes from a collaboration formed early during the pandemic between the investigators of two registries, the UK and global Pregnancy and Neonatal outcomes in COVID-19 (PAN-COVID) study and the US American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Neonatal Perinatal Medicine (AAP SONPM) National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry.

MethodsPAN-COVID (suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage in pregnancy) and the AAP SONPM registry (positive maternal testing for SARS-CoV-2 from 14 days before delivery to 3 days after delivery) studies collected data on maternal, fetal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. PAN-COVID results are presented as all inclusions and those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection only.

ResultsWe report 4004 women in pregnancy affected by suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (1606 from PAN-COVID and 2398 from the AAP SONPM) from January 1st 2020 to July 25th 2020 (PAN-COVID) and August 8th (AAP SONPM). For obstetric outcomes in PAN-COVID and AAP SONPM, respectively, maternal death occurred in 0.5% and 0.17%, early neonatal death in 0.2% and 0.3%, and stillbirth in 0.50% and 0.65% of women. Delivery was pre-term (<37 weeks gestation) in 12% of all women in PAN-COVID, in 16.2% of those women with confirmed infection in PAN-COVID and 16.2% of women in AAP SONPM. Very preterm delivery (< 27 weeks gestation) occurred in 0.6% in PAN-COVID and 0.7% in AAP SONPM.

Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in 0.8% of PAN-COVID all inclusions, 2.0% in PAN-COVID confirmed infections and 1.8% in the AAP SONPM study; the proportions of babies tested were 9.5%, 20.7% and 87.2% respectively.

The proportion of SGA babies was 8.2% in PAN-COVID all inclusions, 9.7% in PAN-COVID confirmed infection and 9.6% in AAP SONPM. Gestational age adjusted mean z-scores were -0.03 for PAN-COVID and -0.18 for AAP SONPM.

ConclusionsThe findings from the UK and US SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy registries were remarkably concordant. Pre-term delivery affected a higher proportion of women in pregnancy than expected from historical and contemporaneous national data. The proportions of women affected by stillbirth, small for gestational age infants and early neonatal death were comparable to historical and contemporaneous UK and US data. Although maternal death was uncommon, the proportion was higher than expected from UK and US population data, likely explained by under-ascertainment of women affected by milder and asymptomatic infection in pregnancy. The data presented support strong guidance for enhanced precautions to prevent SARS-COV-2 infection in pregnancy, particularly in the context of increased risks of preterm delivery and maternal mortality, and for priority vaccination of women planning pregnancy.

What is known about SARS-COV-2 infection in pregnancy and neonates?Cohort, population surveillance studies and living systematic reviews have included limited numbers of women in pregnancy affected by COVID-19 and report that most women and infants had good outcomes.

What this study addsPreterm deliveries occurred in a high proportion of women participating in these two registries in comparison to contemporaneous and historical national data in the UK and US. The majority of preterm deliveries occurred late preterm (between 32+0 and 36+6 weeks gestation).

SARS-COV-2 infection in pregnancy did not appear to be associated with a clinically significant effect on the rate of stillbirth, fetal growth, or neonatal outcomes.

454,Zorro versus Covid-19: fighting the pandemic with face masks,"To confront the global Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the spread of the virus, we need to better understand if face mask use is effective to contain the outbreak and investigate the potential drivers in favor of mask adoption. It is highly questionable since there is no consensus among the general public despite official recommendations. For the first time, we conduct a panel econometric exercise to assess the dynamic impact of face mask use on both infected cases and fatalities at a global scale. We reveal a negative impact of mask wearing on fatality rates and on the Covid-19 number of infected cases. The delay of action varies from around 7 days to 28 days concerning infected cases but is more longer concerning fatalities. We also document the increasing adoption of mask use over time. We find that population density and pollution levels are significant determinants of heterogeneity regarding mask adoption across countries, while altruism, trust in government and demographics are not. Surprisingly, government effectiveness and income level (GDP) have an unexpected influence. However, strict government policies against Covid-19 have the most significant effect on mask use. Therefore, the most effective way of increasing the level of mask wearing is to enforce strict laws on the wearing of masks.",Olivier DAMETTE,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.20237578,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.20237578,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True

The sensitivity of RT-qPCR is contested by the fact that it is time-consuming, executed by trained technicians in proper environment for material extraction. Here, we evaluated the first SARS-CoV-2 antigen test recommended by the World Health Organization at September, 2020 as an alternative for immediate diagnosis of symptomatic and suspected patients at a hospital in Brazil during the epidemic peak. All patients were submitted to RT-qPCR and rapid antigen test using nasopharyngeal swabs rigorously collected at the same time. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, symptoms and outcomes were considered. Prediction analysis revealed that previous stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, desaturation and tachypnea were the most relevant determinants of the death of COVID-19 patients. Comparison between the rapid antigen test and RT-qPCR revealed an overall PPV of 97%, extended to 100% when performed between 4 and 15 days of symptoms, with an accuracy of 90-91% from days 1 to 7 and a  Substantial agreement. The rapid antigen test presented no inconclusive result. Among the discordant results and RT-qPCR inconclusives, 72% presented bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities on imaging and other exams alterations. The median time to obtain RT-qPCR results was 83.6 hours, against 15 minutes for the rapid test, precious time for deciding on patient isolation and management.

456,"Mobilefuge: A low-cost, portable, open source, 3D-printed centrifuge that can be used for purification of saliva samples for SARS-CoV2 detection","One of the best ways to contain the spread of COVID-19 is frequent testing of as many people as possible and timely isolation of uninfected personnel from infected personnel. However, the cost of massive testing is affordable in many countries. The existing technologies might not be scalable to offer affordable testing for millions of people. To address this issue, novel testing methods based on Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) were proposed that are more sensitive, require less reagents and can work with saliva samples instead of more tedious nasal swabs. As a result, LAMP based protocols can make it possible to drive the cost down to one dollar per test. These LAMP based methods require a centrifuge device, mostly for separation of viral particles from reaction inhibitors in saliva samples. However, centrifuge is neither accessible nor affordable in many resource limited settings, especially during this pandemic situation when normal supply chains are heavily disrupted. To overcome these challenges, we invented a low-cost centrifuge that can be useful for carrying out low-cost LAMP based detection of SARS-Cov2 virus in saliva. The 3D printed centrifuge (Mobilefuge) is portable, robust, stable, safe, easy to build and operate. The Mobilefuge doesnt require soldering or programming skills and can be built without any specialised equipment, yet practical enough for high throughput use. More importantly, Mobilefuge can be powered from widely available USB ports, including mobile phones and associated power supplies.

457,Evaluation of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in utero: nine pregnant women and their newborns,"BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), mainly transmitted by droplets and close contact, has caused a pandemic worldwide as of November 2020. According to the current case reports and cohort studies, the symptoms of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to normal adults and may cause a series of adverse consequences of pregnancy (placental abruption, fetal distress, epilepsy during pregnancy, etc.). However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to the fetus through the placental barrier is still a focus of debate.

MethodsIn this study, in order to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 infect fetus through placental barrier, we performed qualitative detection of virus structural protein (spike protein and nucleoprotein) and targeted receptor protein (ACE2, CD147 and GRP78) expression on the placental tissue of seven pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 through immunohistochemistry. Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were collected immediately in the operating room for verification after delivery, which were all tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

ResultsThe result showed that CD147 was expressed on the basal side of the chorionic trophoblast cell membrane and ACE2 was expressed on the maternal side, while GRP78 was strongly expressed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. The RT-PCR results of Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were all negative.

ConclusionsWe believed that despite the detection of viral structural proteins in the placenta, SARS-CoV-2 cannot be transmitted to infants due to the presence of the placental barrier.

SummaryOur results showed that, excluding environmental pollution after birth and vaginal infection during childbirth, SARS-CoV-2 was less likely to be transmitted vertically in utero.",Liang Dong; Shiyao Pei; Qin Ren; Shuxiang Fu; Liang Yu; Hui Chen; Xiang Chen; Mingzhu Yin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248874,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.28.20248874,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True

In order to provide further understanding of the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in these settings, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on samples obtained from 8 selected outbreaks in Minnesota from March - June, 2020. WGS and phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 319 samples, constituting 14.4% of the 2,222 total SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals associated with these outbreaks. Among the sequenced specimens, three LTCFs and both correctional facilities had spread associated with a single genetic sequence. A fourth LTCF had outbreak cases associated with two distinct sequences. In contrast, cases associated with outbreaks in the two meat processing plants represented multiple SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These results suggest that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into a facility can result in a widespread outbreak, and early identification and cohorting of cases, along with continued vigilance with infection prevention and control measures is imperative.",Nicholas B Lehnertz; Xiong Wang; Jacob Garfin; Joanne Taylor; Jennifer Zipprich; Brittany VonBank; Karen Martin; Dana Eikmeier; Carlota Medus; Brooke Wiedinmyer; Carmen Bernu; Matthew Plumb; Kelly Pung; Margaret A Honein; Rosalind Carter; Duncan MacCannell; Kirk E.

459,"Host genome analysis of structural variations by Optical Genome Mapping provides clinically valuable insights into genes implicated in critical immune, viral infection, and viral replication pathways in patients with severe COVID-19.","BackgroundThe varied clinical manifestations and outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections implicate a role of host-genetics in the predisposition to disease severity. This is supported by evidence that is now emerging, where initial reports identify common risk factors and rare genetic variants associated with high risk for severe/ life-threatening COVID-19. Impressive global efforts have focused on either identifying common genetic factors utilizing short-read sequencing data in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or whole-exome and genome studies to interrogate the human genome at the level of detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short indels. However, these studies lack the sensitivity to accurately detect several classes of variants, especially large structural variants (SVs) including copy number variants (CNVs), which account for a substantial proportion of variation among individuals. Thus, we investigated the host genomes of individuals with severe/life-threatening COVID-19 at the level of large SVs (500bp-Mb level) to identify events that might provide insight into the inter-individual clinical variability in clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients.

MethodsOptical genome mapping using Bionanos Saphyr(R) system was performed on thirty-seven severely ill COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). To extract candidate SVs, three distinct analyses were undertaken. First, an unbiased whole-genome analysis of SVs was performed to identify rare/unique genic SVs in these patients that did not appear in population datasets to determine candidate loci as decisive predisposing factors associated with severe COVID-19. Second, common SVs with a population frequency filter was interrogated for possible association with severe COVID-19 based on literature surveys. Third, genome-wide SV enrichment in severely ill patients versus the general population was investigated by calculating odds ratios to identify top-ranked genes/loci. Candidate SVs were confirmed using qPCR and an independent bioinformatics tool (FaNDOM).

ResultsOur patient-centric investigation identified 11 SVs involving 38 genes implicated in three key host-viral interaction pathways: (1) innate immunity and inflammatory response, (2) airway resistance to pathogens, and (3) viral replication, spread, and RNA editing. These included seven rare/unique SVs (not present in the control dataset), identified in 24.3% (9/37) of patients, impacting up to 31 genes, of which STK26 and DPP4 are the most promising candidates. A duplication partially overlapping STK26 was corroborated with data showing upregulation of this gene in severely ill patients. Further, using a population frequency filter of less than 20% in the Bionano control dataset, four SVs involving seven genes were identified in 56.7% (21/37) of patients.

ConclusionThis study is the first to systematically assess and highlight SVs potential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 severity. The genes implicated here identify novel SVs, especially STK26, and extend previous reports involving innate immunity and type I interferon response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our study also shows that optical genome mapping can be a powerful tool to identify large SVs impacting disease outcomes with split survival and add valuable genomic information to the existing sequencing-based technology databases to understand the inter-individual variability associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality.",Nikhil Sahajpal; Chi-Yu Jill Lai; Alex Hastie; Ashis K Mondal; Siavash Raeisi Dehkordi; Cas van der Made; Olivier Fedrigo; Farooq Al-Ajli; Sawan Jalnapurkar; Rashmi Kanagal-Shamanna; Brynn Levy; Silviu-Alin Bacanu; Michael C Zody; Catherine A.

460,IL-2 and IFN- are biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular response in whole blood stimulation assays,"A proper description of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for the assessment of protection elicited after both infection and vaccination. Uncoupled T and B cell responses have been described in acute and convalescent patients and exposed individuals. We assessed the potential usefulness of whole blood stimulation assays to identify functional cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Blood from COVID-19 recovered individuals (5 months after infection) and negative subjects was stimulated for 24 hours with HLA predicted peptide ""megapools"" of the Spike and Nucleoprotein, or the mixture of them. After stimulation, cytokines were quantified using a beads-based multiplex assay. Interleukin-2 and IFN-{gamma} were found to be specific biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 cellular response. Using the Spike and Nucleoprotein mixture, 91.3% of COVID-19 recovered individuals presented an IL-2 stimulation index over the cut-off, while 82.6% showed IFN-{gamma}. All the negative individuals presented an IL-2 response under the cut-off, while 5.3% of these subjects presented positive IFN-{gamma} stimulation indexes. Moreover, IL-2 production correlated with IgG levels for Spike 1, RBD, and Nucleocapsid.

461,"Integrated Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions based Strategies in Ontario, Canada, as a Case Study: a Mathematical Modeling Study","BackgroundRecently, two ""Coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) vaccine products have been authorized in Canada. It is of crucial importance to model an integrated/combined package of non-pharmaceutical (physical/social distancing) and pharmaceutical (immunization) public health control measures.

MethodsA modified epidemiological, compartmental SIR model was utilized and fit to the cumulative COVID-19 case data for the province of Ontario, Canada, from September 8, 2020 to December 8, 2020. Different vaccine roll-out strategies were simulated until 75 percent of the population is vaccinated, including a no-vaccination scenario. We compete these vaccination strategies with relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were supposed to remain enforced and began to be relaxed on either January 31, March 31, or May 1, 2021.

ResultsBased on projections from the data and long-term extrapolation of scenarios, relaxing the public health measures implemented by re-opening too early would cause any benefits of vaccination to be lost by increasing case numbers, increasing the effective reproduction number above 1 and thus increasing the risk of localized outbreaks. If relaxation is, instead, delayed and 75 percent of the Ontarian population gets vaccinated by the end of the year, re-opening can occur with very little risk.

InterpretationRelaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions by re-opening and vaccine deployment is a careful balancing act. Our combination of model projections from data and simulation of different strategies and scenarios, can equip local public health decision- and policy-makers with projections concerning the COVID-19 epidemiological trend, helping them in the decision-making process.",Matthew Betti; Nicola Bragazzi; Jane Heffernan; Jude Dvezela Kong; Angie Raad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249272,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249272,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
462,Identifying silent COVID-19 infections among children is critical for controlling the pandemic,"ImportanceA significant proportion of COVID-19 transmission occurs silently during the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic stages of infection. Children, while being important drivers of silent transmission, are not included in COVID-19 vaccination campaigns given their exclusion from clinical trials thus far.

ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of a targeted approach to identifying silent infections among children as a proxy for their vaccination.

DesignThis study used an age-structured disease transmission model to simulate the synergistic impact of interventions in reducing attack rates over the course of one year.

SettingA synthetic population representative of the demographics of the United States (US).

ParticipantsSix age groups of 0-4, 5-10, 11-18, 19-49, 50-64, 65+ years old, stratified for their population size based on US census data.

ExposuresVaccination of adults, self-isolation of all symptomatic cases within 24 hours of symptom onset, and detection of silent infections.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresVaccination of adults was implemented to reach a 40% coverage over the course of one year with a vaccine efficacy of 95% against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. Without vaccination of children, we determined the proportion and speed that would be required for identifying silent infections among this age group to suppress future attack rates below 5%.

ResultsA targeted approach that identifies 20.6% and 28.6% of silent infections among children within 2 or 3 days post-infection, respectively, would be required to bring attack rates under 5% with vaccination of adults. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rates would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (at least 82%) of this age group, in addition to the base-case 40% vaccination coverage of adults. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses with respect to vaccine efficacy against infection and reduced susceptibility of children to infection.

Conclusions and RelevanceIn the absence of vaccine availability for children, a targeted approach to rapid identification of silent COVID-19 infections in this age group can significantly mitigate disease burden. Without measures to interrupt transmission chains from silent infections, vaccination of adults is unlikely to contain the outbreaks in the near term.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the impact of a targeted strategy for identification of silent COVID-19 infections among children in the absence of their vaccination?

FindingsIn this modelling study, we found that identifying 20-30% of silent infections among children within three days post-infection would bring attack rates below 5% if only adults were vaccinated. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rate would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (at least 82%) of this age group, in addition to vaccination of adults.

463,OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory 1: describing trends and variation in primary care clinical activity for 23.3 million patients in England during the first wave of COVID-19,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare activity globally. The NHS in England stopped most non-urgent work by March 2020, but later recommended that services should be restored to near-normal levels before winter where possible. The authors are developing the OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory, using data to describe changes in service activity during COVID-19, and reviewing signals for action with commissioners, researchers and clinicians. Here we report phase one: generating, managing, and describing the data.

ObjectiveTo describe the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in English primary care across 23.8 million patients records, taking respiratory disease and laboratory procedures as key examples.

MethodsWorking on behalf of NHS England we developed an open source software framework for data management and analysis to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across primary care EHR data on 23.8 million patients; and conducted a population cohort-based study to describe activity using CTV3 coding hierarchy and keyword searches from January 2019-September 2020.

ResultsMuch activity recorded in general practice declined to some extent during the pandemic, but largely recovered by September 2020, with some exceptions. There was a large drop in coded activity for commonly used laboratory tests, with broad recovery to pre-pandemic levels by September. One exception was blood coagulation tests such as International Normalised Ratio (INR), with a smaller reduction (median tests per 1000 patients in 2020: February 8.0; April 6.2; September 7.0). The overall pattern of recording for respiratory symptoms was less affected, following an expected seasonal pattern and classified as ""no change"" from the previous year. Respiratory tract infections exhibited a sustained drop compared with pre-pandemic levels, not returning to pre-pandemic levels by September 2020. Various COVID-19 codes increased through the period. We observed a small decline associated with high level codes for long-term respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Asthma annual reviews experienced a small drop but since recovered, while COPD annual reviews remain below baseline.

ConclusionsWe successfully delivered an open source software framework to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across an unprecedented scale of primary care data. The COVD-19 pandemic led to a substantial change in healthcare activity. Most laboratory tests showed substantial reduction, largely recovering to near-normal levels by September 2020, with some important tests less affected. Records of respiratory infections decreased with the exception of codes related to COVID-19, whilst activity of other respiratory disease codes was mixed.

464,Clinical Validation of a Novel T-cell Receptor Sequencing Assay for Identification of Recent or Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"BackgroundWhile diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine development in the COVID-19 pandemic has proceeded at unprecedented speed and scale, critical gaps remain in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Current diagnostic strategies, including serology, have numerous limitations in addressing these gaps. Here we describe clinical performance of T- Detect COVID, the first reported assay to determine recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and immune repertoire profiling from whole blood samples.

MethodsMethods for high-throughput immunosequencing of the TCR{beta} gene from blood specimens have been described1. We developed a statistical classifier showing high specificity for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection2, utilizing >4,000 SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR sequences from 784 cases and 2,447 controls across 5 independent cohorts. The T-Detect COVID Assay comprises immunosequencing and classifier application to yield a qualitative positive or negative result. Several retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled to assess assay performance including primary and secondary Positive Percent Agreement (PPA; N=205, N=77); primary and secondary Negative Percent Agreement (NPA; N=87, N=79); PPA compared to serology (N=55); and pathogen cross-reactivity (N=38).

ResultsT-Detect COVID demonstrated high PPA in subjects with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (97.1% 15+ days from diagnosis; 94.5% 15+ days from symptom onset), high NPA ([~]100%) in presumed or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative cases, equivalent or higher PPA than two commercial EUA serology tests, and no evidence of pathogen cross-reactivity.

ConclusionT-Detect COVID is a novel T-cell immunosequencing assay demonstrating high clinical performance to identify recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection from standard blood samples. This assay can provide critical insights on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response, with potential implications for clinical management, risk stratification, surveillance, assessing protective immunity, and understanding long-term sequelae.",Sudeb C.

465,SARS-CoV-2 patient self-testing with an antigen-detecting rapid test: a head-to-head comparison with professional testing,"BackgroundAntigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) have been widely recommended as a complement to RT-PCR. Considering the possibility of nasal self-sampling and the ease-of-use in performing the test, self-testing may be an option.

Methods and FindingsWe performed a manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study of nasal mid-turbinate self-sampling and self-testing when using a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. Symptomatic participants suspected to have COVID-19 received written and illustrated instructions. Procedures were observed without intervention. For comparison, Ag-RDTs with nasopharyngeal sampling were professionally performed. Estimates of agreement, sensitivity, and specificity relative to RT-PCR on a combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sample were calculated. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires.

Among 146 symptomatic adults, 40 (27.4%) were RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sensitivity with self-testing was 82.5% (33/40 RT-PCR positives detected; 95% CI 68.1-91.3), and 85.0% (34/40; 95% CI 70.9-92.9) with professional testing. The positive percent agreement between self-testing and professional testing on Ag-RDT was 91.4% (95% CI 77.6-97.0), and negative percent agreement 99.1% (95% CI 95.0-100). At high viral load (>7.0 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml), sensitivity was 96.6% (28/29; 95% CI 82.8-99.8) for both self- and professional testing. Deviations in sampling and testing (incomplete self-sampling or extraction procedure, or imprecise volume applied on the test device) were observed in 25 out of the 40 PCR-positives. Participants were rather young (mean age 35 years) and educated (59.6% with higher education degree). Most participants (80.9%) considered the Ag-RDT as rather easy to perform.

ConclusionsAmbulatory participants suspected for SARS-CoV-2 infection were able to reliably perform the Ag-RDT and test themselves. Procedural errors might be reduced by refinement of the Ag-RDTs for self-testing, such as modified instructions for use or product design/procedures. Self-testing may result in more wide-spread and more frequent testing. Paired with the appropriate information and education of the general public about the benefits and risks, self-testing may therefore have significant impact on the pandemic.",Andreas K.

466,Inherent random fluctuations in COVID-19 outbreaks may explain rapid growth of new mutated virus variants,"A new virus variant of SARS-COV-2 has had a profound impact on society while governments have taken action to limit its impacts by enforcing lockdowns and limiting spread from the UK to other countries. Variants with mutations in the virus genome are likely to occur, but do not always associate to significant changes in the biology of the virus, or the disease. For the variant VOC 202012/01 (also referred to as B.1.1.7), however, preliminary reports indicate it may be more transmissible. Here we use a simulation model calibrated to the inherent random fluctuating transmission pattern of COVID-19 to investigate what the probability may be for detecting more transmissible virus variants post facto. We find that post facto identification of successful virus variants of SARS-COV-2 are likely to exhibit growth rates that are substantially larger than the average growth rate. This finding has implications for interpreting growth rate and transmissibility of new virus variants.",Kenneth Bodin; Joacim Rocklov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249353,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249353,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True

We used an extremely simple epidemiological model that is amenable to implementation in an Excel spreadsheet and includes the demographics of social distancing, efficacy of massive testing and quarantine, and coverage and rate of vaccination as the main parameters to model the progression of COVID-19 pandemics in densely populated urban areas. Our model predicts that effective containment of pandemic progression in densely populated cities would be more effectively achieved by vaccination campaigns that consider the fast distribution and application of vaccines (i.e., 50% coverage in 6 months) while social distancing measures are still in place. Our results suggest that the rate of vaccination is more important than the overall vaccination coverage for containing COVID-19. In addition, our modeling indicates that widespread testing and quarantining of infected subjects would greatly benefit the success of vaccination campaigns. We envision this simple model as a friendly, readily accessible, and cost-effective tool for assisting health officials and local governments in the rational design/planning of vaccination strategies.",Mario Moises Alvarez; Sergio Bravo-Gonzalez; Grissel Trujillo-de Santiago,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249365,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249365,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
468,Optimal design for phase 2 studies of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs,"There is no agreed methodology for pharmacometric assessment of candidate antiviral drugs in COVID-19. The most widely used measure of virological response in clinical trials so far is the time to viral clearance assessed by qPCR of viral nucleic acid in eluates from serial nasopharyngeal swabs. We posited that the rate of viral clearance would have better discriminatory value. Using a pharmacodynamic model fit to individual SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance data from 46 uncomplicated COVID-19 infections in a cohort of prospectively followed adults, we simulated qPCR viral load data to compare type 2 errors when using time to clearance and rate of clearance under varying antiviral effects, sample sizes, sampling frequencies and durations of follow-up. The rate of viral clearance is a uniformly superior endpoint as compared to time to clearance with respect to type 2 error, and it is not dependent on initial viral load or assay sensitivity. For greatest efficiency pharmacometric assessments should be conducted in early illness and daily qPCR samples should be taken over 7 to 10 days in each patient studied.

To have adequate power (>80%) in this pilot study, we pre-specified a significance level of 0.10. Fourteen patients died, one of 25 in quartile 4 (Q4) (O3I [&ge;]5.7%) and 13 of 75 in Q1-3. After adjusting for age and sex, the odds ratio for death in patients with an O3I in Q4 vs Q1-3 was 0.25, p=0.07.

471,Socioeconomic Disparities in the Effects of Pollution on Spread of Covid-19: Evidence from US Counties,"This paper explores disparities in the effect of pollution on confirmed cases of Covid-19 based on counties socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Using data on all US counties on a daily basis over the year 2020 and applying a rich panel data fixed effect model, we document that: 1) there are discernible social and demographic disparities in the spread of Covid-19. Blacks, low educated, and poorer people are at higher risks of being infected by the new disease. 2) The criteria pollutants including Ozone, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 have the potential to accelerate the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. 3) The disadvantaged population is more vulnerable to the effects of pollution on the spread of coronavirus. Specifically, the effects of pollution on confirmed cases become larger for blacks, low educated, and counties with lower average wages in 2019.",Osvalso Allen; Ava Brown; Ersong Wang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249303,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249303,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
472,Quarantine fatigue thins fat-tailed coronavirus impacts in U.S. cities by making epidemics inevitable,"We use detailed location data to show that contacts between individuals in most U.S. cities and counties are fat tailed, suggesting that the fat tails documented in a small number of superspreading clusters are widespread. We integrate these results into a stochastic compartmental model to show that COVID-19 cases were also fat tailed for many U.S. cities for several weeks in the spring and summer. Due to epidemiological thresholds, fat-tailed cases would have been more prevalent if not for the gradual increase in contact rates throughout the summer that made outbreaks more certain.",Marc N Conte; Matthew Gordon; Charles Sims,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249366,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249366,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True

At the antigen level, the mutations only substantially reduced signal in 0.5% of the population. Although some epitope mutations reduce measured signal in up to 6% of the population, these are not the dominant epitopes for their antigens.

474,"Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics, and Virologic Features of COVID-19 Patients in Kazakhstan: a Nation-Wide, Retrospective, Cohort Study.","BackgroundThe earliest coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases in Central Asia were announced in March 2020 by Kazakhstan. Despite the implementation of aggressive measures to curb infection spread, gaps remain in the understanding of the clinical and epidemiologic features of the regional pandemic.

MethodsWe did a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Kazakhstan between February and April 2020. We compared demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data of patients with different COVID-19 severities on admission. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with disease severity and death. Whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 analysis was performed in 53 patients without a recent history of international travel.

FindingsOf the 1072 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in March-April 2020, the median age was 36 years (IQR 24-50) and 484 (45%) were male. On admission, 683 (64%) participants had mild, 341 (32%) moderate, and 47 (4%) severe-to-critical COVID-19 manifestation; 20 deaths (1.87%) were reported at study exit. Multivariable regression indicated increasing odds of severe disease associated with older age (odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07, per year increase; p<0.001), the presence of comorbidities (2.13, 95% CI 1.07-4.23; p<0.031) and elevated white blood cell count (WBC, 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.28; p<0.032) on admission, while older age (1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.12, per year increase; p<0.001) and male sex (5.97, 95% CI 1.95-18.32; p<0.002) were associated with increased odds of death. The Kazakhstan SARS-CoV-2 isolates grouped into seven distinct lineages O/B.4.1, S/A.2, S/B.1.1, G/B.1, GH/B.1.255, GH/B.1.3 and GR/B.1.1.10.

InterpretationOlder age, comorbidities, increased WBC count, and male sex were risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and mortality in Kazakhstan. The broad SARS-CoV-2 diversity suggests multiple importations and community-level amplification, likely predating the declaration of state emergency. Continuous epidemiologic and genomic surveillance may be critical for a better understanding of the regional COVID-19 dynamics.",Sergey Yegorov; Maiya Goremykina; Raifa Ivanova; Sara V Good; Dmitriy Babenko; Alexandr Shevtsov; - the COVID-19 Genomics Research Group; Kelly S.

475,Multi-organ complement deposition in COVID-19 patients,"BackgroundIncreased levels of circulating complement activation products have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but only limited information is available on complement involvement at tissue level. The mechanisms and pathways of local complement activation remain unclear.

MethodsWe performed immunofluorescence analyses of autopsy specimens of lungs, kidney and liver from nine COVID-19 patients who died of acute respiratory failure. Snap-frozen samples embedded in OCT were stained with antibodies against complement components and activation products, IgG and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

FindingsLung deposits of C1q, C4, C3 and C5b-9 were localized in the capillaries of the interalveolar septa and on alveolar cells. IgG displayed a similar even distribution, suggesting classical pathway activation. The spike protein is a potential target of IgG, but its uneven distribution suggests that other viral and tissue molecules may be targeted by IgG. Factor B deposits were also seen in COVID-19 lungs and are consistent with activation of the alternative pathway, whereas MBL and MASP-2 were hardly detectable. Analysis of kidney and liver specimens mirrored findings observed in the lung. Complement deposits were seen on tubules and vessels of the kidney with only mild C5b-9 staining in glomeruli, and on hepatic artery and portal vein of the liver.

InterpretationComplement deposits in different organs of deceased COVID-19 patients caused by activation of the classical and alternative pathways support the multi-organ nature of the disease.

476,Recurrent dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 through the Uruguayan-Brazilian border,"BackgroundUruguay is one of the few countries in the Americas that successfully contained the COVID-19 epidemic during the first half of 2020. Nevertheless, the intensive human mobility across the dry border with Brazil is a major challenge for public health authorities. We aimed to investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in Uruguayan localities bordering Brazil as well as to measure the viral flux across this [~]1,100 km uninterrupted dry frontier.

MethodsUsing complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Uruguayan-Brazilian bordering region and phylogeographic analyses, we inferred the virus dissemination frequency between Brazil and Uruguay and characterized local outbreak dynamics during the first months (May-July) of the pandemic.

FindingsPhylogenetic analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 into Uruguayan localities at the bordering region. The most probable sources of viral strains introduced to Uruguay were the Southeast Brazilian region and the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Some of the viral strains introduced in Uruguayan border localities between early May and mid-July were able to locally spread and originated the first outbreaks detected outside the metropolitan region. The viral lineages responsible for Uruguayan suburban outbreaks were defined by a set of between four and 11 mutations (synonymous and non-synonymous) respect to the ancestral B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 viruses that arose in Brazil, supporting the notion of a rapid genetic differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 subpopulations spreading in South America.

InterpretationAlthough Uruguayan borders have remained essentially closed to non-Uruguayan citizens, the inevitable flow of people across the dry border with Brazil allowed the repeated entry of the virus into Uruguay and the subsequent emergence of local outbreaks in Uruguayan border localities. Implementation of coordinated bi-national surveillance systems are crucial to achieve an efficient control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread across this kind of highly permeable borderland regions around the world.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), was first detected in South America on February 26, 2020, it has rapidly spread through the region, causing nearly 350,000 deaths by December, 2020. In contrast to most American countries, Uruguay avoided an early exponential growth of SARS-CoV-2 cases and during the first six months of the pandemic it registered the lowest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths among South American countries. The intensive cross-border human mobility through the [~]1,100 km uninterrupted dry frontier between Uruguay and Brazil, might poses a major challenge for long-term control of the epidemic in Uruguay. Previous genomic studies conducted in Uruguay have analyzed sequences mostly sampled at the capital city, Montevideo, and detected prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages different from those described in Brazil, thus finding no evidence of frequent viral exchanges between these countries.

Added value of this studyHere we present the first genomic study of SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in different Uruguayan and Brazilian localities along the bordering region. The samples analyzed include 30% (n = 59) of all laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases from Uruguayan departments at the Brazilian border between March and July, 2020, as well as 68 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from individuals diagnosed in the southernmost Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul between March and August, 2020. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 viral lineages that widely spread in the Southeastern Brazilian region (B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33) were also responsible for most viral infections in Rio Grande do Sul and neighboring Uruguayan localities. We further uncover that major outbreaks detected in Uruguayan localities bordering Brazil in May and June, 2020, were originated from two independent introduction events of the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.33, unlike previous outbreaks in the Uruguayan metropolitan region that were seeded by European SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings confirm that although Uruguayan borders have remained essentially closed to non-Uruguayan citizens, dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 across the Uruguayan-Brazilian frontier was not fully suppressed and had the potential to ignite local transmission chains in Uruguay. These findings also highlight the relevance of implementing bi-national public health cooperation workforces combining epidemiologic and genomic data to monitor the viral spread throughout this kind of highly permeable dry frontiers around the world.",Daiana Mir; Natalia Rego; Paola Cristina Resende; Fernando Lopez-Tort; Tamara Fernandez-Calero; Veronica Noya; Mariana Brandes; Tania Possi; Mailen Arleo; Natalia Reyes; Matias Victoria; Andres Lizasoain; Matias Castells; Leticia Maya; Matias Salvo; Tatiana Schaffer Gregianini; Marilda Tereza Mar da Rosa; Leticia Garay Martins; Cecilia Alonso; Yasser Vega; Cecilia Salazar; Ignacio Ferres; Jose Sotelo; Jose Sotelo; Pablo Smircich; Cecilia Matho; Ighor Arantes; Luciana Appolinario; Ana Carolina Mendonca; Maria Jose Benitez-Galeano; Martin Grana; Camila Simoes; Fernando Motta; Marilda Mendonca Siqueira; Gonzalo Bello; Rodney Colina; Lucia Spangenberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.20249026,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.20249026,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
477,Center-Based Experiences Implementing Strategies to Reduce Risk of Horizontal Transmission of SARS-Cov-2: Potential for Compromise of Neonatal Microbiome Assemblage,"Perinatal transmission of COVID-19 is poorly understood and many neonatal intensive care units (NICU) policies minimize mother-infant contact to prevent transmission. We present our units approach and ways it may impact neonatal microbiome acquisition. We attended COVID-19 positive mothers deliveries from March-August 2020. Delayed cord clamping and skin-to-skin were avoided and infants were admitted to the NICU. No parents visits were allowed and discharge was arranged with COVID-19 negative family members. Maternal breast milk was restricted in the NICU. All twenty-one infants tested negative at 24 and 48 hours and had average hospital stays of nine days. 40% of mothers expressed breastmilk and 30% of infants were discharged with COVID-19 negative caregivers. Extended hospital stays, no skin-to-skin contact, limited maternal milk use, and discharge to caregivers outside primary residences, potentially affect the neonatal microbiome.

478,A Novel Abnormality Annotation Database for COVID-19 Affected Frontal Lung X-rays,"PurposeTo advance the usage of CXRs as a viable solution for efficient COVID-19 diagnostics by providing large-scale annotations of the abnormalities in frontal CXRs in BIMCV-COVID19+ database, and to provide a robust evaluation mechanism to facilitate its usage.

Materials and MethodsWe provide the abnormality annotations in frontal CXRs by creating bounding boxes. The frontal CXRs are a part of the existing BIMCV-COVID19+ database. We also define four different protocols for robust evaluation of semantic segmentation and classification algorithms. Finally, we benchmark the defined protocols and report the results using popular deep learning models as a part of this study.

ResultsFor semantic segmentation, Mask-RCNN performs the best among all the models with a DICE score of 0.43 {+/-} 0.01. For classification, we observe that MobileNetv2 yields the best results for 2-class and 3-class classification. We also observe that deep models report a lower performance for classifying other classes apart from the COVID class.

ConclusionBy making the annotated data and protocols available to the scientific community, we aim to advance the usage of CXRs as a viable solution for efficient COVID-19 diagnostics. This large-scale data will be useful for ML algorithms and can be used for learning radiological patterns observed in COVID-19 patients.

479,Findings from Cardiovascular Evaluation of NCAA Division I Collegiate Student-Athletes after Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"ObjectivesThe risk of myocardial damage after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been controversial. There is an urgent need for data to support the appropriate level of cardiovascular screening for safe return-to-play. The purpose of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis is a case series of student-athletes at a single NCAA Division I institution who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody testing (IgG) from 4/15/2020 to 10/31/2020. From 452 athletes who were screened, 5,124 PCR and 452 antibody tests were completed. Student-athletes were followed through 12/31/2020 (median 104 days, range 64-182 days). Cardiac work-up included clinical evaluation, troponin level, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram. Additional work-up was ordered as clinically indicated.

Results55 student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 38 (69%) had symptoms of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), 14 (26%) had a positive IgG test, and 41 (74%) had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, while the remaining six had normal cardiac MRIs.

ConclusionThese data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of cardiovascular testing for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

480,Analysis of Intervention Effectiveness Using Early Outbreak Transmission Dynamics to Guide Future Pandemic Management and Decision-Making in Kuwait,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a World Health Organization designated pandemic that can result in severe symptoms and death that disproportionately affects older patients or those with comorbidities. Kuwait reported its first imported cases of COVID-19 on February 24, 2020. Analysis of data from the first three months of community transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important guidance for decision-making when dealing with future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave management. The analysis of intervention scenarios can help to evaluate the possible impacts of various outbreak control measures going forward which aim to reduce the effective reproduction number during the initial outbreak wave. Herein we use a modified susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-infectious-removed (SEAIR) transmission model to estimate the outbreak dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait. We fit case data from the first 96 days in the model to estimate the basic reproduction number and used Google mobility data to refine community contact matrices. The SEAIR modelled scenarios allow for the analysis of various interventions to determine their effectiveness.

481,High prevalence of long-term psychophysical olfactory dysfunction in patients with COVID-19,"This study prospectively assessed the long-term prevalence of self-reported and psychophysically measured olfactory dysfunction in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Self-reported smell or taste impairment was prospectively evaluated by SNOT-22 at diagnosis, 4-week, 8-week, and 6-month. At 6 months from the diagnosis, psychophysical evaluation of olfactory function was also performed using the 34-item culturally adapted University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (CA-UPSIT). 145 completed both the 6-month subjective and psychophysical olfactory evaluation. According to CA-UPSIT, 87 subjects (60.0%) exhibited some smell dysfunction, with 54 (37.2) being mildly microsmic, 16 (11.0%) moderately microsmic, 7 (4.8%) severely microsmic, and 10 patients (6.9%) being anosmic. At the time CA-UPSIT was administered, a weak correlation was observed between the self-reported alteration of sense of smell or taste and olfactory test scores (Spearmans r=-0.26). Among 112 patients who self-reported normal sense of smell at last follow-up, CA-UPSIT revealed normal smell in 46 (41.1%), mild microsmia in 46 (41.1%), moderate microsmia in 11 (9.8%), severe microsmia in 3 (2.3%), and anosmia in 6 (5.4%) patients; however, of those patients self-reporting normal smell but who were found to have hypofunction on testing, 62 out of 66 had self-reported reduction in sense of smell or taste at an earlier time point. Despite most patients report a subjectively normal sense of smell, we observed a high percentage of persistent smell dysfunction at 6 months from the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 11.7% of patients being anosmic or severely microsmic.

482,Ultrasensitive RNA biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a simple color and luminescence assay,"The COVID-19 pandemic underlines the need for versatile diagnostic strategies. Here, we have designed and developed toehold RNA-based sensors for direct and ultrasensitive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. In our assay, isothermal amplification of a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA coupled with activation of our biosensors leads to a conformational switch in the sensor. This leads to translation of a reporter-protein e.g. LacZ or Nano-lantern that is easily detected using color/luminescence. This response can be visualized by the human eye, or a simple cell phone camera as well as quantified using a spectrophotometer/luminometer.

By optimizing RNA-amplification and biosensor-design, we have generated a highly-sensitive diagnostic assay; with sensitivity down to attomolar (100 copies of) SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Finally, the biosensor efficiently detects the presence of viral RNA in human patient samples, with clear distinction from samples designated negative for the virus. The biosensor response correlates well with Ct values from RT-qPCR tests and thus presents a powerful and easily accessible strategy for detecting Covid infection.",Anirudh Chakravarthy; Anirudh K N; Geen George; Shyamsundar Ranganathan; Nishan Shettigar; Suchitta U; Dasaradhi Palakodeti; Akash Gulyani; Arati Ramesh,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249426,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249426,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
483,Comparing the age and sex trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 morbidity with other respiratory pathogens points to potential immune mechanisms.,"Comparing age and sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and mortality with influenza and other health outcomes opens the way to generating hypotheses as to the underlying mechanisms, building on the extraordinary advances in immunology and physiology that have occurred over the last year. Notable departures in health outcomes starting around puberty suggest that burdens associated with influenza and other causes are reduced relative to the two emergent coronaviruses over much of adult life. Two possible hypotheses could explain this: protective adaptive immunity for influenza and other infections, or greater sensitivity to immunosenescence in the coronaviruses. Comparison of sex differences suggest an important role for adaptive immunity; but immunosenescence might also be relevant, if males experience faster immunosenescence. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin-system in SARS-CoV-2 infection might drive high sensitivity to disruptions of homeostasis. Overall, these results highlight the long tail of vulnerability in the age profile relevant to the emergent coronaviruses, which more transmissible variants have the potential to uncover at the younger end of the scale, and aging populations will expose at the other end of the scale.",C.

484,Predicting severity of Covid-19 using standard laboratory parameters,"BackgroundMore than 1.6 million people have already deceased due to a COVID-19 infection making it a major public health concern. A prediction of severe courses can enhance treatment quality and thus lower fatality and morbidity rates. The use of laboratory parameters has recently been established for a prediction. However, laboratory parameters have rarely been used in combination to predict severe outcomes.

MethodWe used a retrospective case-control design to analyze risk factors derived from laboratory parameters. Patients treated for COVID-19 at an hospital in Krefeld, Germany, from March to May 2020 were included (n =42). Patients were classified into two categories based on their outcome (Mild course vs. treatment in intensive care unit). Laboratory parameters were compared across severity categories using non-parametric statistic. Identified laboratory parameters were used in a logistic regression model. The model was replicated using a) clinical standardized parameters b) aggregated factors derived from a factor analysis.

ResultsPatients in intensive care unit showed elevated ALT, CRP and LDH levels, a higher leukocyte and neutrophile count, a higher neutrophile ratio and a lowered lymphocyte ratio. We were able to classify 95.1% of all cases correctly (96.6% of mild and 91.7% of severe cases, p<.001).

ConclusionA number of routinely collected laboratory parameters is associated with a severe outcome of COVID-19. The combination of these parameters provides a powerful tool in predicting severity and can enhance treatment effectiveness.",Thimo Buchmueller; Ingmar Groening; Ralf Ihl,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249392,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249392,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
485,Competing Health Risks Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic and Response: A Scoping Review,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a global public health threat with infections recorded in nearly every country. Responses to COVID-19 have varied in intensity and breadth, but generally have included domestic and international travel limitations, closure of non-essential businesses, and repurposing of health services. While these interventions have focused on testing, treatment, and mitigation of COVID-19, there have been reports of interruptions to diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services for other public health threats. We conducted a scoping review to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, and malnutrition.

MethodsA scoping literature review was completed using searches of PubMed and preprint servers (medRxiv/bioRxiv) from January 1st to October 31st, 2020, using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 and HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, and malnutrition. Empiric studies reporting original data collection and mathematical models were included, and available data synthesized by region. Studies were excluded if they were not written in English.

ResultsA total of 1604 published papers and 205 preprints met inclusion criteria, including 8.2% (132/1604) of published studies and 10.2% (21/205) of preprints: 7.3% (68/931) on HIV, 7.1% (24/339) on tuberculosis, 11.6% (26/224) on malaria, 7.8% (13/166) on sexual and reproductive health, and 12.1% (16/132) on malnutrition. Thematic results were similar across competing health risks, with substantial indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response on diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, sexual and reproductive health, and malnutrition.

DiscussionCOVID-19 emerged in the context of existing public health threats that result in millions of deaths every year. Thus, effectively responding to COVID-19 while minimizing the negative impacts of COVID-19 necessitates innovation and integration of existing programs that are often siloed across health systems.

486,Epidemiological differences in the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States and China,"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to forecast the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States (US) and China, two countries at different epidemic phases.

MethodsA mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression was used to investigate vaccine impact. Impact was assessed both for a vaccine that prevents infection (VES = 95%) and a vaccine that prevents only disease (VEP = 95%).

ResultsFor VES = 95% and gradual easing of restrictions, vaccination in the US reduced the peak incidence of infection, disease, and death by >55% and cumulative incidence by >32%, and in China by >77% and >65%, respectively. Nearly three vaccinations were needed to avert one infection in the US, but only one was needed in China. For VEP = 95%, benefits of vaccination were half those for VES = 95%. In both countries, the impact of vaccination was substantially enhanced with rapid scale-up, vaccine coverage >50%, and slower or no easing of restrictions, particularly in the US.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccination can flatten, delay, and/or prevent future epidemic waves. However, vaccine impact is destined to be heterogeneous across countries because of an underlying ""epidemiologic inequity"" that reduces benefits for countries already at high incidence, such as the US. Despite 95% efficacy, actual vaccine impact could be meager in such countries, if vaccine scale-up is slow, acceptance of the vaccine is poor, or restrictions are eased prematurely.

One Sentence SummaryVaccine impact will be heterogeneous across countries disadvantaging countries at high incidence. This heterogeneity can be alleviated with rapid vaccination scale-up and limited easing of restrictions.",Monia Makhoul; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

487,Timeliness of U.S. mortality data releases during the COVID-19 pandemic: delays are associated with electronic death registration system and elevated weekly mortality,"All-cause mortality counts allow public health authorities to identify populations experiencing excess deaths from pandemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies. Further, delays in mortality reporting may contribute to misinformation because death counts take weeks to become accurate. We estimate the timeliness of all-cause mortality releases during the Covid-19 pandemic, and identify potential reasons for reporting delays, using 35 weeks of provisional mortality counts between April 3 and December 4, 2020 for 52 states/jurisdictions. On average, states mortality counts are delayed by 5.6 weeks (standard deviation 1.74), with a range of 8.8 weeks between the fastest state and the slowest state. States that hadnt adopted the electronic death registration system were about 4 weeks slower, and 100 additional weekly deaths per million were associated with 0.4 weeks delays, but the residual standard deviation was 0.9 weeks, suggesting other sources of delay. Disaster planning should include improving the timeliness of mortality data.",Janet E Rosenbaum; Marco Stillo; Nathaniel Graves; Roberto Rivera,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249401,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.21249401,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
488,A two-phase stochastic dynamic model for COVID-19 mid-term policy recommendations in Greece: a pathway towards mass vaccination,"From November 7th, 2020, Greece adopted a second nationwide lockdown policy to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the first took place from March 23rd till May 4th, 2020), just as the second wave of COVID-19 was advancing, as did other European countries. In the light of the very promising voluntary mass vaccination, which will start in January 2021, it is of utmost importance for the country to plan to complement vaccination with mid-term Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). The objective is to minimize human losses and to limit social and economic costs. In this paper a two-phase stochastic dynamic network compartmental model (a pre-vaccination SEIR until February 15th, 2021 and a post-vaccination SVEIR from February 15th, 2021 to June 30th, 2021) is developed. Three scenarios are assessed in the first phase: (a) a baseline scenario, which lifts the national lockdown and all NPIs on January 2021, (b) a ""semi-lockdown"" scenario with school opening, partial retail sector operation, universal mask wearing and social distancing/teleworking on January 2021 and (c) a ""rolling lockdown"" scenario combining a partial lifting of measures in January 2021 followed by a third imposed nationwide lockdown in February 2021. In the second phase three scenarios with different vaccination rates are assessed. Publicly available data along with some preliminary first results of the SHARE COVID-19 survey conducted in Greece are used as input. The results regarding the first phase indicate that the ""semi-lockdown"" scenario outperforms the third lockdown scenario (5.7% less expected fatalities), whereas in the second phase it is of great importance to ensure a sufficient vaccine supply and high vaccination rates.",Nikolaos P.

489,Fibrinolysis influences SARS-CoV-2 infection in ciliated cells,"Rapid spread of COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented pandemic worldwide, and an inserted furin site in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) may account for increased transmissibility. Plasmin, and other host proteases, may cleave the furin site of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and {gamma} subunits of epithelial sodium channels ({gamma} ENaC), resulting in an increment in virus infectivity and channel activity. As for the importance of ENaC in the regulation of airway surface and alveolar fluid homeostasis, whether SARS-CoV-2 will share and strengthen the cleavage network with ENaC proteins at the single-cell level is urgently worthy of consideration. To address this issue, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) datasets, and found the PLAU (encoding urokinase plasminogen activator), SCNN1G ({gamma}ENaC), and ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) were co-expressed in alveolar epithelial, basal, club, and ciliated epithelial cells. The relative expression level of PLAU, TMPRSS2, and ACE2 were significantly upregulated in severe COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines using Seurat and DESeq2 R packages. Moreover, the increments in PLAU, FURIN, TMPRSS2, and ACE2 were predominately observed in different epithelial cells and leukocytes. Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2 may share and strengthen the ENaC fibrinolytic proteases network in ACE2 positive airway and alveolar epithelial cells, which may expedite virus infusion into the susceptible cells and bring about ENaC associated edematous respiratory condition.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425801,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425801,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,False
490,Vimentin binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies targeting extracellular vimentin block in vitro uptake of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles,"Infection of human cells by pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, typically proceeds by cell surface binding to a crucial receptor. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a necessary receptor, but not all ACE2-expressing cells are equally infected, suggesting that other extracellular factors are involved in host cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that is increasingly recognized as being present on the extracellular surface of a subset of cell types, where it can bind to and facilitate pathogens cellular uptake. Here, we present evidence that extracellular vimentin might act as a critical component of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex in mediating SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. We demonstrate direct binding between vimentin and SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and show that antibodies against vimentin block in vitro SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-expressing cell lines. Our results suggest new therapeutic strategies for preventing and slowing SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on targeting cell host surface vimentin.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425793,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425793,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,False
491,Neutralizing antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain isolated from a naïve human antibody library,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust antibody responses in some patients, with a majority of the response directed at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike surface glycoprotein. Remarkably, many patient-derived antibodies that potently inhibit viral infection harbor few to no mutations from the germline, suggesting that naive antibody libraries are a viable means for discovery of novel SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Here, we used a yeast surface-display library of human naive antibodies to isolate and characterize three novel neutralizing antibodies that target the RBD: one that blocks interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and two that target other epitopes on the RBD. These three antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus with IC50 values as low as 60 ng/mL in vitro. Using a biolayer interferometry-based binding competition assay, we determined that these antibodies have distinct but overlapping epitopes with antibodies elicited during natural COVID-19 infection. Taken together, these analyses highlight how in vitro selection of naive antibodies can mimic the humoral response in vivo, yielding neutralizing antibodies and various epitopes that can be effectively targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.",Benjamin Nikola Bell; Abigail E.

492,Artemisia annua L. extracts prevent in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) globally has infected and killed millions of people. Besides remdesivir, there are no approved small molecule-based therapeutics. Here we show that extracts of the medicinal plant, Artemisia annua L., which produces the antimalarial drug artemisinin, prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. We measured antiviral activity of dried leaf extracts of seven cultivars of A. annua sourced from four continents. Hot-water leaf extracts based on artemisinin, total flavonoids, or dry leaf mass showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 0.1-8.7 M, 0.01-0.14 g, and 23.4-57.4 g, respectively. One sample was >12 years old, but still active. While all hot water extracts were effective, concentrations of artemisinin and total flavonoids varied by nearly 100-fold in the extracts and antiviral efficacy was inversely correlated to artemisinin and total flavonoid contents. Artemisinin alone showed an estimated IC50 of about 70 M, and antimalarial artemisinin derivatives artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were ineffective or cytotoxic at elevated micromolar concentrations. In contrast, the antimalarial drug amodiaquine had an IC50 = 5.8 M. The extracts had minimal effects on infection of Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells by a reporter virus pseudotyped by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There was no cytotoxicity within an order of magnitude of the antiviral IC90 values. Results suggest the active component in the extracts is likely something besides artemisinin or is a combination of components acting synergistically to block post-entry viral infection. Further studies will determine in vivo efficacy to assess whether A. annua might provide a cost-effective therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.",Manoj S Nair; Yaoxing Huang; David A Fidock; Stephen J Polyak; Jessica Wagoner; Melissa Towler; Pamela Weathers,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425825,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.425825,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,False
493,Ad26.COV2.S-elicited immunity protects against G614 spike variant SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters and does not enhance respiratory disease in challenged animals with breakthrough infection after sub-optimal vaccine dosing,"Previously we have shown that a single dose of recombinant adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vaccine expressing a prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen (Ad26.COV2.S) is immunogenic and provides protection in Syrian hamster and non-human primate SARS-CoV-2 infection models. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity, protective efficacy and potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) mediated by Ad26.COV2.S in a moderate disease Syrian hamster challenge model, using the currently most prevalent G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 variant. Vaccine doses of 1x109 vp and 1x1010 vp elicited substantial neutralizing antibodies titers and completely protected over 80% of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated Syrian hamsters from lung infection and pneumonia but not upper respiratory tract infection. A second vaccine dose further increased neutralizing antibody titers which was associated with decreased infectious viral load in the upper respiratory tract after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Suboptimal non-protective immune responses elicited by low-dose A26.COV2.S vaccination did not exacerbate respiratory disease in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated Syrian hamsters with breakthrough infection. In addition, dosing down the vaccine allowed to establish that binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlate with lower respiratory tract protection probability. Overall, these pre-clinical data confirm efficacy of a 1-dose vaccine regimen with Ad26.COV2.S in this G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 virus variant Syrian hamster model, show the added benefit of a second vaccine dose, and demonstrate that there are no signs of VAERD under conditions of suboptimal immunity.",Joan E.M. van der Lubbe; Sietske K.

494,Inflight Transmission of COVID-19 Based on Aerosol Dispersion Data,"BackgroundAn issue of concern to the travelling public is the possibility of in-flight transmission of COVID-19 during long- and short-haul flights. The aviation industry maintain the probability of contracting the illness is small based on reported cases, modelling and data from aerosol dispersion experiments conducted on-board aircraft.

MethodsUsing experimentally derived aerosol dispersion data for a B777-200 aircraft and a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation we estimate inflight infection probability for a range of scenarios involving quanta generation rate and face mask efficiency. Quanta generation rates were selected based on COVID-19 events reported in the literature while mask efficiency was determined from the aerosol dispersion experiments.

ResultsThe MID-AFT cabin exhibits the highest infection probability. The calculated maximum individual infection probability (without masks) for a 2-hour flight in this section varies from 4.5% for the ""Mild Scenario"" to 60.2% for the ""Severe Scenario"" although the corresponding average infection probability varies from 0.1% to 2.5%. For a 12-hour flight, the corresponding maximum individual infection probability varies from 24.1% to 99.6% and the average infection probability varies from 0.8% to 10.8%. If all passengers wear face masks throughout the 12-hour flight, the average infection probability can be reduced by approximately 73%/32% for high/low efficiency masks. If face masks are worn by all passengers except during a one-hour meal service, the average infection probability is increased by 59%/8% compared to the situation where the mask is not removed.

ConclusionsThis analysis has demonstrated that while there is a significant reduction in aerosol concentration due to the nature of the cabin ventilation and filtration system, this does not necessarily mean that there is a low probability or risk of in-flight infection. However, mask wearing, particularly high-efficiency ones, significantly reduces this risk.",Zhaozhi Wang; Edwin R Galea; Angus J Grandison; John Ewer; Fuchen Jia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249439,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.08.21249439,2021-01-08,2021-01-08,,True
495,A Multiple Linear Regression Analysis of Rural-Urban COVID-19 Risk Disparities in Texas,"As the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. rises, the differential impact of the pandemic in urban and rural regions becomes more pronounced, and the major factors relating to this difference remain unclear. Using the 254 counties of Texas as units of analysis, we utilized multiple linear regression to investigate the influence of 83 county-level predictor variables including race demographics, age demographics, healthcare and financial status, and prevalence of and mortality rate from COVID-19 risk factors on the incidence rate and case fatality rate from COVID-19 in Texas on September 15, 2020. Here, we report that urban counties experience, on average, 41.1% higher incidence rates from COVID-19 than rural counties and 34.7% lower case fatality rates. Through comparisons between our models, we found that this difference was largely attributable to four major predictor variables: namely, the proportion of elderly residents, African American residents, and Hispanic residents, and the presence of large nursing homes. According to our models, counties with high incidence rates of COVID-19 are predicted to have high proportions of African American residents and Hispanic residents coupled with low proportions of elderly residents. Furthermore, we found that counties with the highest case fatality rates are predicted to have high proportions of elderly residents, obese residents, and Hispanic residents, coupled with low proportions of residents ages 20-39 and residents who report smoking cigarettes. In our study, major variables and their effects on COVID-19 risk are quantified, highlighting the most vulnerable populations and regions of Texas.",Amber K.

Besides having great impact on public health, this phenomenon raises the question if immunity generated by a single infection is sufficient to provide sterilizing/protective immunity to a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. The Golden Syrian hamster is a manageable animal model to explore immunological mechanisms able to counteract COVID-19, as it recapitulates pathological aspects of mild to moderately affected patients. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2-inoculated hamsters resolve infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts within seven days upon inoculation with the Cat01 (G614) SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Three weeks after primary challenge, and despite high titers of neutralizing antibodies, half of the animals were susceptible to reinfection by both identical (Cat01, G614) and variant (WA/1, D614) SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, upon re-inoculation, only nasal tissues were transiently infected with much lower viral replication than those observed after the first inoculation. These data indicate that a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is not sufficient to elicit a sterilizing immunity in hamster models but protects against lung disease.",Marco Brustolin; Jordi Rodon; Maria Luisa Rodriguez de la Concepcion; Carlos Avila-Nieto; Guillermo Cantero; Monica Perez; Te Nigeer; Marc Noguera-Julian; Victor Guallar; Alfonso Valencia; Nuria Roca; Nuria Izquierdo-Useros; Julia Blanco; Bonaventura Clotet; Albert Bensaid; Jorge Carrillo; Julia Vergara-Alert; Joaquim Segales,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425729,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425729,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
497,New targets for drug design: Importance of nsp14/nsp10 complex formation for the 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic activity on SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has triggered a global pandemic with devastating consequences for health-care and social-economic systems. Thus, the understanding of fundamental aspects of SARS-CoV-2 is of extreme importance.

In this work, we have focused our attention on the viral ribonuclease (RNase) nsp14, since this protein was considered one of the most interferon antagonists from SARS-CoV-2, and affects viral replication. This RNase is a multifunctional protein that harbors two distinct activities, an N-terminal 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), both with critical roles in coronaviruses life cycle. Namely, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN knockout mutants are non-viable, indicating nsp14 as a prominent target for the development of antiviral drugs.

Nsp14 ExoN activity is stimulated through the interaction with the nsp10 protein, which has a pleiotropic function during viral replication. In this study, we have performed the first biochemical characterization of the complex nsp14-nsp10 from SARS-CoV-2. Here we confirm the 3-5 exoribonuclease and MTase activities of nsp14 in this new Coronavirus, and the critical role of nsp10 in upregulating the nsp14 ExoN activity in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 N7-MTase activity is functionally independent of the ExoN activity. The nsp14 MTase activity also seems to be independent of the presence of nsp10 cofactor, contrarily to nsp14 ExoN.

Until now, there is no available structure for the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex. As such, we have modelled the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex based on the 3D structure of the complex from SARS-CoV (PDB ID 5C8S). We also have managed to map key nsp10 residues involved in its interaction with nsp14, all of which are also shown to be essential for stimulation of the nsp14 ExoN activity. This reinforces the idea that a stable interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is strictly required for the nsp14-mediated ExoN activity of SARS-CoV-2, as observed for SARS-CoV.

We have studied the role of conserved DEDD catalytic residues of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN. Our results show that motif I of ExoN domain is essential for the nsp14 function contrasting to the functionality of these conserved catalytic residues in SARS-CoV, and in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). The differences here revealed can have important implications regarding the specific pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

The nsp10-nsp14 interface is a recognized attractive target for antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. This work has unravelled a basis for discovering inhibitors targeting the specific amino acids here reported, in order to disrupt the assembly of this complex and interfere with coronaviruses replication.",Margarida Saramago; Cátia Bárria; Vanessa Costa; Caio S.

In the current study, we applied our adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-2P)-based vaccine, MVC-COV1901, to hamster models to demonstrate immunogenicity and protection from virus challenge. Golden Syrian hamsters immunized intramuscularly with two injections of 1 {micro}g or 5 {micro}g of S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) were challenged intranasally with SARS-CoV-2. Prior to virus challenge, the vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies with 10,000-fold higher IgG level and an average of 50-fold higher pseudovirus neutralizing titers in either dose groups than vehicle or adjuvant control groups. Six days after infection, vaccinated hamsters did not display any weight loss associated with infection and had significantly reduced lung pathology and most importantly, lung viral load levels were reduced to lower than detection limit compared to unvaccinated animals. Vaccination with either 1 g or 5 g of adjuvanted S-2P produced comparable immunogenicity and protection from infection.

499,Genetic Characteristics and Phylogeny of 969-bp S Gene Sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from Hawaii Reveals the Worldwide Emerging P681H Mutation,"COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the world, caused over 1.8 million deaths in the first year, and severely affected the global economy. Hawaii is not spared from the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the local population, including high infection rates in racial and ethnic minorities. Early in the pandemic, we described in this journal various technologies used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Herein we characterize a 969-bp SARS-CoV-2 segment of the S gene downstream of the receptor-binding domain. At the John A. Burns School of Medicine Biocontainment Facility, RNA was extracted from an oropharyngeal swab and a nasal swab from two patients from Hawaii who were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. Following PCR, the two viral strains were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGAX. Phylogenetic tree results indicate that the virus has been introduced to Hawaii from multiple sources. Further, we decoded 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 13 unique SARS-CoV-2 genomes within this region of the S gene, with one non-synonymous mutation (P681H) found in the two Hawaii strains. The P681H mutation has unique and emerging characteristics with a significant exponential increase in worldwide frequency when compared to the plateauing of the now universal D614G mutation. The P681H mutation is also characteristic of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom and Nigeria. Additionally, several mutations resulting in cysteine residues were detected, potentially resulting in disruption of the disulfide bridges in and around the receptor-binding domain.

Biophysical and biochemical assays confirm that hBD-2 indeed binds to the CoV-2-receptor binding domain (RBD) (KD [~] 300 nM), preventing it from binding to ACE2 expressing cells. Importantly, hBD-2 shows specificity by blocking CoV-2/spike pseudoviral infection, but not VSV-G mediated infection, of ACE2 expressing human cells with an IC50 of 2.4{+/-} 0.1 M.

We therefore performed a meta-study with a diverse set of transcriptomes under infections with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including data from different cells and COVID-19 patients. Using these data, we investigated viral entry routes and innate immune responses. First, our analyses support the existence of cell entry mechanisms for SARS and SARS-CoV-2 other than the ACE2 route with evidence of inefficient infection of cells without expression of ACE2; expression of TMPRSS2/TPMRSS4 is unnecessary for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection with evidence of efficient infection of A549 cells transduced with a vector expressing human ACE2. Second, we find that innate immune responses in terms of interferons and interferon simulated genes are strong in relevant cells, for example Calu3 cells, but vary markedly with cell type, virus dose, and virus type.",Yingying Cao; Xintian Xu; Simo Kitanovski; Lina Song; Jun Wang; Pei Hao; Daniel Hoffmann,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425716,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425716,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
502,Neuropilin-1 Assists SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Stimulating the Separation of Spike Protein Domains S1 and S2,"The cell surface receptor Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) was recently identified as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. As the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into the S1 and the S2 domain by furin protease, Nrp1 binds to the newly created C-terminal RRAR amino acid sequence of the S1 domain. In this study, we model the association of a Nrp1 (a2-b1-b2) protein with the Spike protein computationally and analyze the topological constraints in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for binding with Nrp1 and ACE2. Importantly, we study the exit mechanism of S2 from the S1 domain with the assistance of ACE2 as well as Nrp1 by molecular dynamics pulling simulations. In the presence of Nrp1, by binding the S1 more strongly to the host membrane, there is a high probability of S2 being pulled out, rather than S1 being stretched. Thus, Nrp1 binding could stimulate the exit of S2 from the S1 domain, which will likely increase virus infectivity as the liberated S2 domain mediates the fusion of virus and host membranes. Understanding of such a Nrp1-assisted viral infection opens the gate for the generation of protein-protein inhibitors, such as antibodies, which could attenuate the infection mechanism and protect certain cells in a future combination therapy.",Zhenlu Li; Matthias Buck,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425627,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.425627,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
503,Stable Interaction Of The UK B.1.1.7 lineage SARS-CoV-2 S1 Spike N501Y Mutant With ACE2 Revealed By Molecular Dynamics Simulation,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused a massive health crisis across the world, and genetic variants such as the D614G gaining enhanced infectivity and competitive fitness have significantly aggravated the global concern. In this regard, the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.1.7 lineage, reported from the United Kingdom (UK) is of great significance, in that it contains several mutations that increases its infection and transmission rates as evidenced by the increased number of clinical reports. Specifically, the N501Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) domain has been shown to possess increased affinity for ACE2, although the basis for this not yet clear. Here, we dissect the mechanism underlying the increased affinity using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the available ACE2-S1-RBD complex structure (6M0J) and show a prolonged and stable interaction of the Y501 residue in the N501Y mutant S1-RBD with interfacial residues, Y41 and K353, in ACE2 as compared to the wild type S1-RBD. Additionally, we find that the N501Y mutant S1-RBD displays altered dynamics that likely aids in its enhanced interaction with ACE2. By elucidating a mechanistic basis for the increased affinity of the N501Y mutation in S1-RBD for ACE2, we believe that the results presented here will aid in developing therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 including designing drugs targeting the ACE2-S1-RBD interaction.",Wesam Ahmed; Angelin M Phillip; Kabir H Biswas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425307,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425307,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
504,Immunoinformatic based analytics on T-cell epitope from spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 concerning Indian population.,"The whole world is drastically affected by the current pandemic due to severe virus, SARS-CoV-2 and scientists are rigorously looking for the efficient vaccine against it that become an emergent issue. Reverse vaccinology approach may provide us with significant therapeutic leads in this direction and further determination of T-cell / B-cell response to antigen. In the present study, we conducted population coverage analysis referring to the diverse Indian population. By using tools from Immune epitope database (IEDB), HLA- distribution analysis was performed to find the most promiscuous T-cell epitope out of In silico determined epitope of Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. Selection of these epitopes have been conducted based on their binding affinity with the maximum number of HLA alleles belong to the highest population coverage rate values for the chosen geographical area in India. 404 cleavage sites within the 1288 amino acids sequence of spike glycoprotein were determined by NetChop proteasomal cleavage prediction suggesting that this protein has adequate sites in the protein sequence for cleaving into appropriate epitopes. For population coverage analysis, 221 selected epitopes are considered that shows the projected population coverage as 83.08% with 19.29 average hit (average number of epitope hits/HLA combinations recognized by the population) and 5.91 pc90 (minimum number of epitope hits/HLA combinations recognized by 90% of the population). 54 epitopes are found with the highest coverage among the Indian population and highly conserved within the given spike RBD domain sequence. Docking analysis of each epitope with their respective allele suggests that the epitope NSFTRGVYY represents highest binding affinity with docking score -7.6 kcal/mol with its allele HLA-C*07:01 among all the epitopes. Since the Covid-19 cases are still in progress and seem to remain like this until we find an effective vaccine, moreover in countries like India, vast diversity in the population may present a hindrance to particular vaccine efficiency. Outcomes from this study could be critical to design vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for a different set of the population within the country.",Sreevidya S.

We generated isogenic N501 and Y501 SARS-CoV-2. Sera of 20 participants in a previously reported trial of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 had equivalent neutralizing titers to the N501 and Y501 viruses.",Xuping Xie; Jing Zou; Camila R.

506,Interleukin-6 Receptor Antagonists in Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19 - Preliminary report,"BackgroundThe efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is unclear.

MethodsWe evaluated tocilizumab and sarilumab in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult patients with Covid-19, within 24 hours of commencing organ support in an intensive care unit, were randomized to receive either tocilizumab (8mg/kg) or sarilumab (400mg) or standard care (control). The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with pre-defined triggers to declare superiority, efficacy, equivalence or futility.

ResultsTocilizumab and sarilumab both met the pre-defined triggers for efficacy. At the time of full analysis 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab and 402 to control. Median organ support-free days were 10 (interquartile range [IQR] -1, 16), 11 (IQR 0, 16) and 0 (IQR -1, 15) for tocilizumab, sarilumab and control, respectively. Relative to control, median adjusted odds ratios were 1.64 (95% credible intervals [CrI] 1.25, 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95%CrI 1.17, 2.91) for sarilumab, yielding >99.9% and 99.5% posterior probabilities of superiority compared with control. Hospital mortality was 28.0% (98/350) for tocilizumab, 22.2% (10/45) for sarilumab and 35.8% (142/397) for control. All secondary outcomes and analyses supported efficacy of these IL-6 receptor antagonists.

ConclusionsIn critically ill patients with Covid-19 receiving organ support in intensive care, treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonists, tocilizumab and sarilumab, improved outcome, including survival.

507,Sequencing of SARS CoV2 in local transmission cases through oxford nanopore MinION platform from Karachi Pakistan,"The first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS CoV2) was imported to Pakistan in February 2020 since then 10,258 deaths have been witnessed. The virus has been mutating and local transmission cases from different countries vary due to host dependent viral adaptation. Many distinct clusters of variant SARS CoV2 have been defined globally. In this study, the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 was studied and locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants.The real time PCR was performed on nasopharyngeal specimen to confirm SARSCoV2 with Orf 1ab and E gene as targets. The viral sequencing was performed through oxford nanopore technology MinION platform. Isolates from first and second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Karachi were compared. The overall positivity rate for PCR was 26.24% with highest number of positive cases in June. Approximately, 37.45% PCR positive subjects aged between 19-40 years. All the isolates belonged to GH clade and shared missense mutation D614G in spike protein linked to increased transmission rate worldwide. Another spike protein mutation A222V coexisted with D614G in the virus from second wave of COVID-19. Based on the present findings it is suggested that the locally transmitted virus from Karachi vary from those reported from other parts of Pakistan. Slight variability was also observed between viruses from first and second wave. Variability in any potential vaccine target may result in failed trials therefore information on any local viral variants is always useful for effective vaccine design and/or selection.

Authors summaryDespite precautionary measures the COVID-19 pandemic is causing deaths all over the world. The continuous mutations in viral genome is making it difficult to design vaccines. Variability in genome is host dependent and data sharing has revealed that variant for different geographical locations may harbor different mutations. Keeping this in mind the current study was focused on the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID -19 suspected cases with impact of age and gender. The locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants. The sequenced viral genome varied from the already submitted sequences from Pakistan thereby confirming that slightly different viruses were causing infections during different time periods in Karachi. All belonged to GH clade with D614G, P323L and Q57H mutations. The virus from second wave had A222V mutation making it more different. This information can be useful in selecting or designing a vaccine.",Samina  Naz Mukry; Shariq Ahmed; Ali  Raza Bukhari; Aneeta Shahni; Gul Sufaida; Arshi Naz; Tahir  Sultan Shamsi,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425705,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.07.425705,2021-01-07,2021-01-07,,False
508,A novel computational approach to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics through the inference of unsampled sources of infection,"Infectious diseases such as the COVID19 pandemic cemented the importance of disease tracking. The role of asymptomatic, undiagnosed individuals in driving infection has become evident. Their unaccountability results in ineffective prevention. We developed a pipeline using genomic data to accurately predict a populations transmission network complete with the inference of unsampled sources. The system utilises Bayesian phylogenetics to capture evolutionary and infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It identified the effectiveness of preventive measures in Canadas Atlantic bubble and mobile populations such as New York State. Its robustness extends to the prediction of cross-species disease transmission as we inferred SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to lions and tigers in New York Citys Bronx Zoo. The proposed methods ability to generate such complete transmission networks, provides a more detailed insight into the transmission dynamics within a population.

509,Stochastic model for COVID-19 in slums: interaction between biology and public policies,"We present a mathematical model for the simulation of the development of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a slum area under different interventions. Instead of representing interventions as modulations of the parameters of a free running epidemic we introduce a model structure that accounts for the actions but does not assume the results. The disease is modelled in terms of the progression of viremia reported in scientific works. The emergence of symptoms in the model reflects the statistics of a nation-wide highly detailed database consisting of more than 62000 cases (about a half of the confirmed by RT-PCR tests) with recorded symptoms in Argentina. The stochastic model displays several of the characteristics of COVID-19 such as a high variability in the evolution of the outbreaks, including long periods in which they run undetected, spontaneous extinction followed by a late outbreak and unimodal as well as bimodal progressions of daily counts of cases (second waves without ad-hoc hypothesis). We show how the relation between undetected cases (including the ""asymptomatic"" cases) and detected cases changes as a function of the public policies, the efficiency of the implementation and the timing with respect to the development of the outbreak. We show also that the relation between detected cases and total cases strongly depends on the implemented policies and that detected cases cannot be regarded as a measure of the outbreak, being the dependency between total cases and detected cases in general not monotonic as a function of the efficiency in the intervention method. According to the model, it is possible to control an outbreak with interventions based on the detection of symptoms only in the case when the presence of just one symptom prompts isolation and the detection efficiency reaches about 80% of the cases. Requesting two symptoms to trigger intervention can be enough to fail in the goals.",Hernan G. Solari; Mario A.
