0,Automated processing of thermal imaging to detect COVID-19,"Rapid and sensitive screening tools for SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential to limit the spread of COVID-19 and to properly allocate national resources. Here, we developed a new point-of-care, non-contact thermal imaging tool to detect COVID-19, based on image-processing algorithms and machine learning analysis. We captured thermal images of the back of individuals with and without COVID-19 using a portable thermal camera that connects directly to smartphones. Our novel image processing algorithms automatically extracted multiple texture and shape features of the thermal images and achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 in detecting COVID-19 with up to 92% sensitivity. Thermal imaging scores were inversely correlated with clinical variables associated with COVID-19 disease progression. We show, for the first time, that a hand-held thermal imaging device can be used to detect COVID-19. Non-invasive thermal imaging could be used to screen for COVID-19 in out-of-hospital settings, especially in low-income regions with limited imaging resources.",Rafael Y.

1,Prevalence of bacterial pathogens and potential role in COVID-19 severity in patients admitted to intensive care units in Brazil,"Secondary bacterial and fungal infections are associated with respiratory viral infections and invasive mechanical ventilation. In Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), lung injury by SARS-CoV-2 and impaired immune response can provide a favorable environment for microorganism growth and colonization in hospitalized individuals. Recent studies suggest that secondary bacterial pneumonia is a risk factor associated with COVID-19. In Brazil, knowledge about microbiota present in COVID-19 patients is incipient. This work describes the microbiota of 21 COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units from two Brazilian centers. We identified respiratory, nosocomial and bacterial pathogens as prevalent microorganisms. Other bacterial opportunistic and commensal species are also represented. Virulence factors of these pathogenic species, metabolic pathways used to evade and modulate immunological processes and the interconnection between bacterial presence and virulence in COVID-19 progression are discussed.",Fabiola Marques Carvalho; Leandro Nascimento Lemos; Luciane Prioli Ciapina; Rennan Garcias Moreira; Alexandra Gerber; Ana Paula Guimaraes; Tatiani Fereguetti; Virginia Antunes de Andrade Zambelli; Renata Avila; Tailah Bernardo de Almeida; Jheimson Silva Lima; Shana Priscila Coutinho Barroso; Mauro Martins Teixeira; Renan Pedra Souza; Cynthia Chester Cardoso; Renato Santana Aguiar; Ana Tereza Ribeiro Vasconcelos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248501,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248501,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
2,THE SEARCH FOR AN ASSOCIATION OF HLA ALLELES AND COVID-19 RELATED MORTALITY IN THE RUSSIAN POPULATION,"HLA genes play a pivotal role in an immune response via the presentation of pathogen peptides in a complex on the surface of cells of a host organism. Here, we studied the association of class I and class II genes with the severity of COVID-19 infection and HLA allele variants. We performed high-resolution sequencing of class I and class II HLA genes using the sample population of 147 patients who died of COVID-19 and statistically compared our results with the frequencies of the HLA genotypes in a control population of 270 samples. The obtained data demonstrated that 51:05 and 15:18 alleles from locus B* are statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 severity, while C*14:02 allele correlates with the probability of death from COVID-19 for patients without comorbidities.",Valery Cheranev; Irina Bulusheva; Valery I.

3,"Real-world clinical performance of commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests in suspected COVID-19: A systematic meta-analysis of available data as per November 20, 2020","Background: Immunochromatographic rapid antigen tests (RATs) emerged onto the COVID-19 pandemic testing landscape to aid in the rapid diagnosis of people with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RATs are particularly useful where RT-PCR is not immediately available and symptoms suggestive of a high viral load and infectiousness are assumed. Several lateral flow immunoassays have been authorized for use under EUA and/or the CE mark, presenting varying overall clinical performance data generated by the manufacturer or by independent investigators. To compare the real-world clinical performance of commercially available rapid chromatographic immunoassays intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of published data. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE (R), Embase, BIOSIS and Derwent Drug File (ProQuest) for manufacturer-independent prospective clinical performance studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 RATs and RT-PCR assays. Only studies on lateral flow assays not needing a separate reader for retrieving the result were included, if data were available on viral load, patients' symptom status, sample type, and PCR assay used. For better data comparability, recalculation of the studies' single performance data confidence intervals using the exact Clopper-Pearson method was applied. Results: We could include 19 studies (ten peer-reviewed) presenting detailed clinical performance data on 11,209 samples with 2449 RT-PCR-positives out of study prevalence rates between 1.9-100% and between 50-100% symptomatic samples. Four studies directly compared two to three different RATs and 15 studies compared one RAT to RT-PCR. Overall specificity ranged, with one test outlier, between 92.4% (87.4-95.9) and 100% (99.7-100), and overall clinical sensitivity varied between 28.9% (16.4-44.3) and 98.3% (91.1-99.7), depending on assay, population characteristics, viral load, and symptom status. Sensitivity in high-viral-load samples (cycle threshold [&le;]25) showed a considerable heterogeneity among the assays ranging from 66.7% to 100%. Conclusion: Only two RATs offered sufficient manufacturer-independent, real-world performance data supporting use for the detection of current SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic or high-viral-load patient populations. Reliable positive predictive values require testing of symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals only in case of a high pre-test probability. If RATs are used for screening of asymptomatic cases in low-prevalence scenarios, a lower positive predictive value of the result has to be considered.",Johannes Hayer; Dusanka Kasapic; Claudia Silke Zemmrich,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248614,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248614,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
4,Predicting the Evolution of COVID-19 Mortality Risk: a Recurrent Neural Network Approach,"Background: The propagation of COVID-19 in Spain prompted the declaration of the state of alarm on March 14, 2020. On 2 December 2020, the infection had been confirmed in 1,665,775 patients and caused 45,784 deaths. This unprecedented health crisis challenged the ingenuity of all professionals involved. Decision support systems in clinical care and health services management were identified as crucial in the fight against the pandemic. Methods: This study applies Deep Learning techniques for mortality prediction in COVID-19 patients. Two datasets with clinical information (medication, laboratory tests, vital signs etc.) of 2,307 and 3,870 COVID-19 infected patients admitted to two Spanish hospital chains were used. Firstly, we built a sequence of temporal events gathering all the clinical information for each patient. Next, we used the temporal sequences to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with an attention mechanism exploring interpretability. We conducted extensive experiments and trained the RNNs in different settings, performing hyperparameter search and cross-validation. We ensembled resulting RNNs to reduce variability and enhance sensitivity. Results: We assessed the performance of our models using both global metrics, by averaging the performance across all the days in the sequences. We also measured day-by-day metrics starting from the day of hospital admission and the outcome day and evaluated the daily predictions. Regarding sensitivity, when compared to more traditional models, our best two RNN ensemble models outperform a Support Vector Classifier in 6 and 16 percentage points, and Random Forest in 23 and 18 points. For the day-by-day predictions from the outcome date, the models also achieved better results than baselines showing system's ability towards early predictions. Conclusions: We have shown the feasibility of our approach to predict the clinical outcome (i.e. discharged alive or death) of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The result is a time series model that can support decision-making in healthcare systems and aims at interpretability. Despite the low-resource scenario, the results achieved are promising and suggests that more data will further increase the performance of the model.",Marta Villegas; Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre; Asier Gutiérrez-Fandiño; Jordi Armengol-Estapé; Casimiro Pio Carrino; David Pérez Fernández; Felipe Soares; Pablo Serrano; Miguel Pedrera; Noelia García; Alfonso Valencia,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20244061,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20244061,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
5,Hospitalization for self-harm during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in France: a nationwide study,"Introduction. Little is known to date about the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on self-harm incidence. Methods. The number of hospitalizations for self-harm in France (mainland and overseas) from January to August 2020 (which includes the first confinement from March 17th to May 11th) was compared to the same period in 2019-2017. Hospital data with the ICD-10 codes X60-84 were extracted from the national administrative database (PMSI). Results. There were 53,583 hospitalizations for self-harm in France between January and August 2020. Compared to the same period in 2019, this represents an overall 8.5% decrease. This decrease started the first week of the confinement and the number of hospitalizations remained at lower levels relative to 2019 until the end of August. The decrease was more marked in women (-9.8%) than men (-6.4%). However, an increase in hospitalizations was observed in individuals aged 75 and older (+5.3 to +11.6%). Moreover, the number of self-harm by firearm (+20.3%), jumping from height (+10.5%), and drowning (+4.7%) increased between 2019 and 2020, as well as the number of hospitalizations in intensive care (+3.5%) and deaths at discharge from hospital (+8.0%). No correlation was found between the evolution in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm and the number of severe cases of Covid-19 (hospitalization and mortality rates) across administrative departments. Discussion. During the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in France - including the first confinement -, a general decrease in the number of hospitalizations for self-harm was observed. However, an increase was found among elderly, a population at higher Covid 19- related mortality risk, and in the number of more severe suicidal acts. These results, therefore, shed light on a complex relationship between the pandemic and self-harm occurrence. This situation may change with time, which requires active suicide prevention strategies.",Fabrice Jollant; Adrien Roussot; Emmanuelle Corruble; Jean-Christophe CHAUVET-GELINIER; Bruno Falissard; Yann Mikaeloff; Catherine Quantin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248480,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248480,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
6,Coronavirus GenBrowser for monitoring adaptive evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 has widely spread across the world, and much research is being conducted on the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. To help control the infection, we developed the Coronavirus GenBrowser (CGB) to monitor the pandemic. CGB allows visualization and analysis of the latest viral genomic data. Distributed genome alignments and an evolutionary tree built on the existing subtree are implemented for easy and frequent updates. The tree-based data are compressed at a ratio of 2,760:1, enabling fast access and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants. CGB can effectively detect adaptive evolution of specific alleles, such as D614G of the spike protein, in their early stage of spreading. By lineage tracing, the most recent common ancestor, dated in early March 2020, of nine strains collected from six different regions in three continents was found to cause the outbreak in Xinfadi, Beijing, China in June 2020. CGB also revealed that the first COVID-19 outbreak in Washington State was caused by multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2. To encourage data sharing, CGB credits the person who first discovers any SARS-CoV-2 variant. As CGB is developed with eight different languages, it allows the general public in many regions of the world to easily access pre-analyzed results of more than 132,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. CGB is an efficient platform to monitor adaptive evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Dalang Yu; Xiao Yang; Bixia Tang; Yi-Hsuan Pan; Jianing Yang; Junwei Zhu; Guangya Duan; Zi-Qian Hao; Hailong Mu; Long Dai; Wangjie Hu; - Language translation team; Xiao Su; Guo-Qing Zhang; Wenming Zhao; Haipeng Li,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248612,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248612,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
7,Identifying communities at risk for COVID-19-related burden across 500 U.S. Cities and within New York City,"Background. While it is well-known that older individuals with certain comorbidities are at highest risk for complications related to COVID-19 including hospitalization and death, we lack tools to identify communities at highest risk with fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Information collected at a county level obscures local risk and complex interactions between clinical comorbidities, the built environment, population factors, and other social determinants of health. Methods. We develop a robust COVID-19 Community Risk Score (C-19 Risk Score) that summarizes the complex disease co-occurrences for individual census tracts with unsupervised learning, selected on their basis for association with risk for COVID complications, such as death. We mapped the C19 Risk Score onto neighborhoods in New York City and associated the score with C-19 related death. Last, we predict the C-19 Risk Score using satellite image data to map the built environment in C-19 Risk. Results. The C-19 Risk Score describes 85% of variation in co-occurrence of 15 diseases that are risk factors for COVID complications among 26K census tract neighborhoods (median population size of tracts: 4,091). The C-19 Risk Score is associated with a 40% greater risk for COVID-19 related death across NYC (April and September 2020) for a 1SD change in the score (Risk Ratio for 1SD change in C19 Risk Score: 1.4, p < .001). Satellite imagery coupled with social determinants of health explain nearly 90% of the variance in the C-19 Risk Score in the United States in held-out census tracts (R2 of 0.87). Conclusions. The C-19 Risk Score localizes COVID-19 risk at the census tract level and predicts COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality.",Chirag J Patel; Andrew Deonarine; Genevieve Lyons; Chirag Lakhani; Arjun K Manrai,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248360,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248360,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
8,"Risk factors for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A cross-sectional study in 116,678 people.","Background The risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well characterised in Western populations. We sought to identify potential risk factors for transmission and actionable information to prevent for SARS-CoV-2. Methods Individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 at three major laboratories were invited. In addition, participants were sampled by convenience after a media campaign. Self-reported test results were compared with laboratory results, demographic data and behavioural facts were collected using a digital platform. In a cross-sectional design positive cases were compared with negative and untested control groups. Findings Approximately than 14 days after lockdown, 116,678 participants were included. Median age was 46 years, 44% had children in preschool or in school; 18% were practicing health professionals. International flights, contact with infected, and gatherings of more than 50 people, were associated with high risk. Health professionals who used public transport were at higher risk of testing positive than those who did not. Having undergone light infections, the last six months was strongly associated with lower odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Contact with children, use of hand sanitiser and use of protective gloves in private were also associated with lower odds ratio of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation Further research is needed to explore if being a parent or looking after children is associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the next phases of the pandemic. Immunological research should be done to determine the effects of prior trivial infections on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We confirm that large gatherings during the pandemic should be avoided and those who are infected, or under suspicion thereof, posed very high risks to others this population.",Eyrun F Kjetland; Karl Trygve Kalleberg; Camilla Lund Soraas; Bato Hammarstrom; Tor Age Myklebust; Synne Jenum; Eyvind Axelsen; Andreas Lind; Roar Bevre-Jensen; Silje Bakken Jorgensen; Frank Olav Pettersen; Lene B Solberg; Cathrine Lund Hadley; Mette Stausland Istre; Knut Liestol; John Arne Dahl; Giske Ursin; Arne Soraas,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248514,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248514,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
9,"Reducing contacts to stop SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the second pandemic wave in Brussels, Belgium","Background: Reducing contacts is a cornerstone of containing SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the effect of physical distancing measures and of school reopening on contacts and consequently on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Brussels, a hotspot during the second European wave. Methods: Using SARS-CoV-2 case reports and contact tracing data during August-November 2020, we estimated changes in the age-specific number of reported contacts. We associated these trends with changes in the instantaneous reproduction number Rt and in age-specific transmission-events during distinct intervention periods in the Brussels region. Furthermore, we analysed trends in age-specific case numbers, pre- and post-school opening. Findings: When schools reopened and physical distancing measures relaxed, the weekly mean number of reported contacts surged from 2.01 (95%CI 1.73-2.29) to 3.04 (95%CI 2.93-3.15), increasing across all ages. The fraction of cases aged 10-19 years started increasing before school reopening, with no further increase following school reopening (risk ratio 1.23, 95%CI 0.79-1.94). During the subsequent month, 8.9% (67/755) of infections identified were from teenagers to other ages, while 17.0% (131/755) from other ages to teenagers. Rt peaked mid-September at 1.48 (95%CI 1.35-1.63). Reintroduction of physical distancing measures reduced reported contacts to 1.85 (95%CI 1.78-1.91), resulting in Rt dropping below 1 within 3 weeks. Interpretation: The second pandemic wave in Brussels was the result of increased contacts across all ages following school reopening. Stringent physical distancing measures, including closure of bars and limiting close contacts while schools remain open, reduced social mixing, in turn controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

10,Adenovirus and RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines: perceptions and acceptance among healthcare workers,"Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the perception, confidence, hesitancy, and acceptance rate of various COVID-19 vaccine types among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia, a nation with MERS-CoV experience. Design National cross-sectional, pilot-validated questionnaire. Setting Online, self-administered questionnaire among HCWs. Participants A total of 2,007 HCWs working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated; 75.3% completed the survey and were included in the analysis. Intervention Data were collected through an online survey sent to HCWs during November 1-15, 2020. The main outcome measure was HCW acceptance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through logistic regression analysis and via measurement of the level of anxiety, using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD7) scale. Results Among the 1512 HCWs who were included, 62.4% were women, 70.3% were between 21 and 40 years of age, and the majority (62.2%) were from tertiary hospitals. In addition, 59.5% reported knowing about at least one vaccine; 24.4% of the participants were sure about their willingness to receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 20.9% were willing to receive the RNA BNT162b2 vaccine. However, 18.3% reported that they would refuse to receive the Ad5-vectored vaccine, and 17.9% would refuse the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Factors that influenced the differential readiness of HCWs included their perceptions of the vaccine's efficiency in preventing the infection (33%), their personal preferences (29%), and the vaccine's manufacturing country (28.6%). Conclusions Awareness by HCWs of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve their perceptions and acceptance of vaccination.

11,Toward a COVID-19 testing policy: where and how to test when the purpose is to isolate silent spreaders,"Background To stop pandemics, such as COVID 19, infected individuals should be detected, treated if needed, and to prevent contacts with susceptible individuals- isolated. Because most infected individuals may be asymptomatic, when testing misses such cases, epidemics may growth exponentially, inducing a high number of deaths. In contrast, a relatively low number of COVID 19 related deaths may occur when both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are tested. Methods To evaluate these hypotheses, a method composed of three elements was evaluated, which included: (i) county and country level geo-referenced data, (ii) cost benefit related considerations, and (iii) temporal data on mortality or test positivity (TP). TP is the percentage of infections found among tested individuals. Temporal TP data were compared to the tests/case ratio (T/C ratio) as well as the number of tests performed/million inhabitants (tests/mi) and COVID-19 related deaths/million inhabitants (deaths/mi). Findings Two temporal TP profiles were distinguished, which, early, displayed low (~ 1 %) and/or decreasing TP percentages or the opposite pattern, respectively. Countries that exhibited >10 TP % expressed at least ten times more COVID-19 related deaths/mi than low TP countries. An intermediate pattern was identified when the T/C ratio was explored. Georeferenced, TP based analysis discovered municipalities where selective testing would be more cost effective than alternatives. Interpretations When TP is low and/or the T/C ratio is high, testing detects asymptomatic cases and the number of COVID 19 related deaths/mi is low. Georeferenced TP data can support cost-effective, site specific policies. TP promotes the prompt cessation of epidemics and fosters science based testing policies.",Ariel L Rivas; Almira L Hoogesteijn; James Hittner; Marc HV van Regenmortel; Prakasha Kempaiah; Paris Vogazianos; Athos Antoniades; Jose PL Febles; Folorunso Oludayo Fasina,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20223651,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20223651,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
12,Analysis of genome characteristics and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 strains in North-East of Romania during the first COVID-19 outbreak,"Romania officially declared its first SARS-CoV-2 case on February 26, 2020. The first and largest COVID-19 outbreak in Romania was recorded in Suceava, N/E region of the country, and originated at the Suceava regional county hospital. Following sheltering-in-place measures, infection rates decreased, only to rise again after relaxation of measures. This study describes the incursion of SARS-CoV-2 in Suceava and other parts of Romania and analyzes the mutations and their association with clinical manifestation of the disease during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated multiple sites of origin for SARS-CoV-2 strains in Suceava, specifically from Spain, Italy and Russia, but also other strains related to those from Czech Republic, Belgium and France. Most Suceava samples contained mutations common to European lineages, such as A20268G, however aproximately 10% of samples were missing such mutations, indicating a possible different origin. While overall genome regions ORF1ab, S and ORF7 were subject to most mutations, several recurring mutations such as C27707T were identified, and these were mainly present in severe forms of the disease. Non-synonymous mutations, such as C3225A (Thr987Asn in NSP3a domain), associated with changes in a protein responsible for decreasing viral tethering in human host were also present. Patients with diabetes and hypertension exhibited eight and three time,s respectively, higher odds ratios of acquiring severe forms of the disease and these were mainly related to C27707T mutation. These results will aid in tracing virus movement throughout Romania and identification of infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity.",Andrei Lobiuc; Mihai Dimian; Roxana Puscaselu; Olga Sturdza; Mihai Covasa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248741,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248741,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
13,COVID-19 deaths detected in a systematic post-mortem surveillance study in Africa,"Objectives Limited SARS CoV 2 testing in many African countries has constrained availability of data on the impact of COVID-19 (CV19). To address this gap, we conducted a systematic post-mortem surveillance study to directly measure the fatal impact of CV19 in an urban African population. Design We enrolled deceased individuals at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) Morgue in Lusaka, Zambia. We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs for testing via reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) against the SARS-2 Coronavirus. We stratified deaths by CV19 status, by location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors. Setting UTH is the largest tertiary care referral hospital in Zambia and its morgue registers ~80% of Lusaka's deaths. Participants Participants of all ages were enrolled if within 48 hours of death and if the next of kin or representative provided written informed consent. Results We enrolled 372 participants between June and September 2020, and had PCR results for 364 (99.5%). CV19 was detected in 70/364 (19.2%). The median age for CV19+ deaths was 48 years (IQR 36-72 years) and 70% were male. Most CV19+ deaths (51/70, 72.8%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for CV19 antemortem. Among the 19/70 facility deaths, six were tested antemortem. Among the 52/70 CV19 deaths with symptoms data, 44/52 had typical symptoms of CV19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested antemortem. We identified CV19 among seven children; only one had been tested antemortem. The proportion of CV19+ deaths increased with age, but 75.7% of CV19+ deaths were aged <60 years. The five most common co-morbidities among CV19+ deaths were: tuberculosis (31.4%); hypertension (27.1%); HIV/AIDS (22.9%); alcohol use (17.1%); and diabetes (12.9%). Conclusions Contrary to expectations, CV19+ deaths were common in Lusaka. The majority occurred in the community where testing capacity is lacking. Yet few who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of CV19. Therefore, CV19 cases were under reported because testing was rarely done, not because CV19 was rare. If our data are generalizable, the impact of CV19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated.",Lawrence Mwananyanda; christopher gill; William MacLeod; Geoffrey Kwenda; Rachel Pieciak; Zachariah Mupila; Francis Mupeta; Leah Forman; Luunga Ziko; Lauren Etter; Donald Thea,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248327,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248327,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True

Our study investigated the clinical features of COVID-19 patients in Latvia and differences in blood tests in groups with different disease severity. Methods: The retrospective study included 100 patients hospitalized in Riga East Clinical University Hospital in Spring 2020. The severity of the disease course was classified by the presence of pneumonia and its combination with respiratory failure. We have assessed blood cells' count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin T, electrolytes, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), D-dimer, prothrombin time, prothrombin index, oxygen saturation, and temperature on admission to the hospital. Results: Patients were from 18 to 99, 57% males. Comorbidities were found in 74% of patients. The mild, moderate, and severe groups included 35, 44, and 16 patients, respectively. In the severe group, the mortality rate was 50%. The progression to severe COVID-19 was associated positively with temperature, ESR, CRP, creatinine, LDH, and troponin T and negatively associated with oxygen saturation, eosinophils, and GFR on admission to the hospital. Conclusions: COVID-19 severity associates with lower renal function and a higher level of inflammation and tissue damage. Eosinophils, CRP, ESR, LDH, troponin T, creatinine, and GFR are blood indicators for monitoring patients' condition.",Ludmila Viksna; Oksana Kolesova; Aleksandrs Kolesovs; Ieva Vanaga; Seda Arutjunana; Sniedze Laivacuma; Jelena Storozenko; Ieva Tolmane; Ilze Berzina; Baiba Rozentale,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20239392,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20239392,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
15,Effective design of barrier enclosure to contain aerosol emissions from COVID-19 patients,"Facing shortages of personal protective equipment, some clinicians have advocated the use of barrier enclosures (typically mounted over the head, with and without suction) to contain aerosol emissions from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. There is however little evidence for its usefulness. To test the effectiveness of such a device, we built a manikin that can expire micron-sized aerosols at flow rates close to physiological conditions. We then placed the manikin inside the enclosure and used a laser sheet to visualize the aerosol leaking out. We show that with sufficient suction, it is possible to effectively contain aerosol from the manikin even at high flow rates (up to 60 L min-1) of oxygen, reducing aerosol exposure outside the enclosure by 99%. In contrast, a passive barrier without suction only reduces aerosol exposure by 60%.",Dan Daniel; Marcus Lin; Irvan Luhung; Tony Lui; Anton Sadovoy; Xueqi Koh; Anqi Sng; Tuan Tran; Stephan Schuster; Xian Jun Loh; Oo Schwe Tet; Chee Keat Tan,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20246868,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20246868,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
16,Emotional Adaptation During A Crisis: Decline in Anxiety and Depression After the Initial Weeks of COVID-19 in the United States,"Objective: Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic are known to exacerbate depression and anxiety, though their temporal trajectories remain unclear. The present study aims to investigate fluctuations in depression and anxiety using COVID-19 as a model crisis. Methods: 1,512 adults living in the U.S. enrolled in this online study on April 2nd, 2020 and were assessed weekly for 10 weeks (until June 4th, 2020; final n=537). Depression and anxiety were measured using the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale), respectively, along with demographic and COVID-related questions. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety. Results: Depression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time (F(9,4824)=17.53, p<.001 and F(9,4824)=23.35, p<.001, respectively). In addition to demographic factors such as sex, age, income, and psychiatric diagnoses, we identified some overlapping and some distinct dynamic factors contributing to changes in depression and anxiety: worsening of weekly individual economic impact of COVID-19 increased both depression and anxiety, while increased seven-day change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected pandemic duration were positively associated with anxiety, but not depression. Conclusions: Alongside evidence for overall emotional adaptation, these findings highlight overlapping (economic), yet distinct (change in COVID-19 cases, social media use, and projected COVID-19 duration) factors contributing to fluctuations in depression and anxiety throughout the first wave of COVID-19. These results provide insight into socioeconomic policies and behavioral changes that can increase emotional adaptation in times of crisis.",Anastasia Shuster; Madeline O'Brien; Yi Luo; Matthew Heflin; Dongil Chung; Soojung Na; Ofer Perl; Kaustubh Kulkarni; Vincenzo G Fiore; Xiaosi Gu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248773,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248773,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True

18,"How the COVID-19 pandemic affects transgender health care in upper-middle income and high income countries - A worldwide, cross-sectional survey","Background Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to medical care was restricted for nearly all non-acute medical conditions. Due to their status as a vulnerable social group and the inherent need for transition-related treatments (e.g., hormone treatment), transgender people are assumed to be affected particularly severely by the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and health care of transgender people. Methods and findings As an ad hoc collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and 23 community organizations, we developed a web-based survey. The survey was translated into 26 languages, and participants were recruited via various social media and LGBTIQ-community sources. Recruitment started in May 2020. We assessed demographical data, physical and mental health problems (e.g., chronic physical conditions), risk factors (e.g., smoking), COVID-19 data (symptoms, contact history, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19), and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to transgender health care and health-related supplies. To identify factors associated with the experience of restrictions to transgender health care, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis. 5267 transgender people from 63 higher-middle income and high-income countries participated in the study. Over 50% of the participants had risk factors for a severe course of a COVID-19 infection and were at a high risk of avoiding testing or treatment of a COVID-19 infection due to the fear of mistreatment or discrimination. Access to transgender health care services was restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic for 50% of the participants. Male sex assigned at birth and a lower monthly income were significant predictors for the experience of restrictions to health care. 35.0% of the participants reported at least one mental health conditions. Every third participant had suicidal thoughts, and 3.2% have attempted suicide since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. A limitation of the study is that we did not analyze data from low-income countries and access to the internet was necessary to participate. Conclusions Transgender people are assumed to suffer under the severity of the pandemic even more than the general population due to the intersections between their status as a vulnerable social group, their high amount of medical risk factors, and their need for ongoing medical treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic can potentiate these vulnerabilities, add new challenges for transgender individuals, and, therefore, can lead to devastating consequences, like severe physical or mental health issues, self-harming behaviour, and suicidality.",Andreas Koehler; Joz Motmans; Leo Mulio Alvarez; David Azul; Karen Badalyan; Koray Basar; Cecilia Dhejne; Dragana Duisin; Bartosz Grabski; Aurore Dufrasne; Natasa Jokic-Begic; Antonio Prunas; Christina Richards; Kirill Sabir; Jaimie Vaele; Timo Ole Nieder,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248794,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248794,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
19,Environmental scan of provincial and territorial planning for COVID-19 vaccination programs,"Background: Public health departments in Canada are currently facing the challenging task of planning and implementing COVID-19 vaccination programs. Objective: To collect and synthesize information regarding COVID-19 vaccination programs in each of the provinces and territories (P/Ts). Methods: Provincial/territorial public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference between August-October 2020 to collect information on the following topics, drawn from scientific literature and media: unique factors for COVID-19 vaccination, adoption of National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommendations, priority groups for early vaccination, and vaccine safety and effectiveness monitoring. Data were grouped according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Eighteen interviews occurred with 25 participants from 11 of 13 P/Ts. Factors unique to COVID-19 vaccination included prioritizing groups for early vaccination (n=7), public perception of vaccines (n=6), and differing eligibility criteria (n=5). Almost all P/Ts (n=10) reported reliance on NACI recommendations. Long-term care residents (n=10) and health care workers (n=10) were most frequently prioritized for early vaccination, followed by people with chronic medical conditions (n=9) and seniors (n=8). Most P/Ts (n=9) are planning routine adverse event monitoring to assess vaccine safety. Evaluation of effectiveness was anticipated to occur within public health departments (n=3), by researchers (n=3), or based on national guidance (n=4). Conclusion: Plans for COVID-19 vaccination programs in the P/Ts exhibit some similarities and are largely consistent with NACI guidelines, with some discrepancies.

20,Acceptance and Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccines: A Cross-Sectional Study from Jordan,"Background: Vaccines are effective interventions that can reduce the high burden of diseases globally. However, public vaccine hesitancy is a pressing problem for public health authorities. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, little information is available on the public acceptability and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines in Jordan. This study aimed to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines and its predictors in addition to the attitudes towards these vaccines among public in Jordan. Methods: An online, cross-sectional, and self-administered questionnaire was instrumentalized to survey adult participants from Jordan on the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis was used to find the predictors of COVID-19 vaccines acceptability. Results: A total of 3,100 participants completed the survey. The public acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines was fairly low (37.4%) in Jordan. Males (OR=2.488, 95CI%=1.834-3.375, p<.001) and those who took the seasonal influenza vaccine (OR=2.036, 95CI%=1.306-3.174, p=.002) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, participants who believed that vaccines are generally safe (OR=9.258, 95CI%=6.020-14.237, p<.001) and those who were willing to pay for vaccines (OR=19.223, 95CI%=13.665-27.042, p<.001), once available, were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. However, those above 35 years old (OR=0.376, 95CI%=0.233-0.607, p<.001) and employed participants (OR=0.542, 95CI%=0.405-0.725, p<.001) were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, participants who believed that there was a conspiracy behind COVID-19 (OR=0.502, 95CI%=0.356-0.709, p<.001) and those who do not trust any source of information on COVID-19 vaccines (OR=0.271, 95CI%=0.183-0.400, p<.001), were less likely to have acceptance towards them. The most trusted sources of information on COVID-19 vaccines were healthcare providers. Conclusion: Systematic interventions are required by public health authorities to reduce the levels of vaccines hesitancy and improve their acceptance. We believe these results and specifically the low rate of acceptability is alarming to Jordanian health authorities and should stir further studies on the root causes and the need of awareness campaigns. These interventions should take the form of reviving the trust in national health authorities and structured awareness campaigns that offer transparent information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and the technology that was utilized in their production.",Tamam El-Elimat; Mahmoud M.

21,Introduction into the Marseille geographical area of a mild SARS-CoV-2 variant originating from sub-Saharan Africa,"Background: In Marseille, France, the COVID-19 incidence evolved unusually with several successive epidemic episodes. The second outbreak started in July, was associated with North Africa, and involved travelers and an outbreak on passenger ships. This suggested the involvement of a new viral variant. Methods: We sequenced the genomes from 916 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in our institute. The patients' demographic and clinical features were compared according to the infecting viral variant. Results: From June 26th to August 14th, we identified a new viral variant (Marseille-1). Based on genome sequences (n = 89) or specific qPCR (n = 53), 142 patients infected with this variant were detected. It is characterized by a combination of 10 mutations located in the nsp2, nsp3, nsp12, S, ORF3a, ORF8 and N/ORF14 genes. We identified Senegal and Gambia, where the virus had been transferred from China and Europe in February-April as the sources of the Marseille-1 variant, which then most likely reached Marseille through Maghreb when French borders reopened. In France, this variant apparently remained almost limited to Marseille. In addition, it was significantly associated with a milder disease compared to clade 20A ancestor strains. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can genetically diversify rapidly; its variants can diffuse internationally and cause successive outbreaks.",Philippe Colson; Anthony Levasseur; Philippe Gautret; Florence Fenollar; Van-Thuan Hoang; Jeremy Delerce; Idir Bitam; Rachid Saile; Mossaab Maaloum; Abdou Padane; Marielle Bedotto; Ludivine Brechard; Vincent Bossi; Mariem Ben Khedher; Herve Chaudet; Matthieu Million; Herve Tissot-Dupont; Jean Christophe Lagier; Souleymane Mboup; Pierre-Edouard Fournier; Didier Raoult,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248758,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248758,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
22,"Evaluation of the Effect of Zinc, Quercetin, Bromelain and Vitamin C on COVID-19 Patients","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. There are three phases of COVID-19: early infection stage, pulmonary stage and hyper-inflammation stage respectively. It is important to prevent lung or other organs injuries by preventing phase-II and phase-III via pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments. This was a case series study done on twenty-two patients confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients in this study have been used quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily as supplements for 3 to 5 days during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid combination supplements on patients with COVID-19. The mean levels of WBC, ANC, ALC, AMC and AST were normal among all included patients before and after taking quercetin, bromelain, zinc and ascorbic acid supplements (P-value > 0.05). Quercetin 800 mg, bromelain 165 mg, zinc acetate 50 mg and ascorbic acid 1 g once daily supplements were safe for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may prevent poor prognosis.

23,Hydrating the Respiratory Tract: An Alternative Explanation Why Masks Lower Severity of COVID-19 Disease,"Seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low relative humidity in indoor environments, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal layer lining the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside face masks, where super-saturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic face masks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air.",Adriaan Bax; Joseph M Courtney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248671,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.20248671,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
24,The experience of European hospital-based healthcare workers on following infection prevention and control procedures for COVID-19,"Background: Working under pandemic conditions exposes health care workers (HCWs) to infection risk and psychological strain. Protecting the physical and psychological health of HCWs is a key priority. This study assessed the perceptions of European hospital HCWs of local infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on their emotional wellbeing. Methods: We performed two rounds of an international cross-sectional survey, between 31 March and 17 April 2020 via existing research networks (round 1), and between 14 May and 31 August 2020 via online convenience sampling (round 2). Main outcome measures were (1) behavioural determinants of HCW adherence with IPC procedures, (2) WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a validated scale of 0-100 reflecting emotional wellbeing. The WHO-5 was interpreted as a score below or above 50 points, a cut-off score used in previous literature to screen for depression. Results: 2,289 HCWs (round 1: n=190, round 2: n=2,099) from 40 countries in Europe participated. Mean age of respondents was 42 ({+/-}11) years, 66% were female, 47% and 39% were medical doctors and nurses, respectively. 74% (n=1699) of HCWs were directly treating patients with COVID-19, of which 32% (n=527) reported they were fearful of caring for these patients. HCWs reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 infection risk to themselves (71%) and their family (82%) as a result of their job. 40% of HCWs considered that getting infected with COVID-19 was not within their control. This was more common among junior than senior HCWs (46% versus 38%, P value <.01). Sufficient COVID-19-specific IPC training, confidence in PPE use and institutional trust were positively associated with the feeling that becoming infected with COVID-19 was within their control. Female HCWs were more likely than males to report a WHO-5 score below 50 points (aOR 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.8). Conclusions: In Europe, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a differential impact on those providing direct COVID-19 patient care, junior staff and women.

25,Engineered CRISPR/Cas12a Enables Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has swept through the globe at an unprecedented rate. CRISPR-based detection technologies such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK, and STOPCovid have emerged as a rapid and affordable platform that can shape the future of diagnostics. Recently, we reported engineered crRNAs for Cas12a, called ENHANCE, that enables enhanced detection of nucleic acids. Here we report development, clinical validation, and advancement of ENHANCE platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2. With an RT-LAMP pre-amplification step, ENHANCE detects samples down to a single copy with 95% accuracy and shows high specificity towards various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 against 31 highly similar and common respiratory pathogens. Utilizing LbCas12a-mediated trans-cleavage activity, ENHANCE works robustly in a wide range of magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), allowing for further assay optimization. Additionally, ENHANCEv2 is developed to further improve the previously reported ENHANCE. ENHANCEv2 employs mutated LbCas12aD156R, engineered chimeric DNA-extended crRNA, and a dual reporter for both fluorescence-based reporter assay and lateral flow assay. Both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 are validated in 62 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, showing 60/62 (96.7%) agreement with RT-qPCR results, and using only 5 L of sample and 20 minutes of CRISPR reaction. Lateral flow assay on paper strips displays 100% agreement with fluorescence-based reporter assay in the clinical validation. Following a 30-minute pre-amplification RT-LAMP step, the lyophilized ENHANCEv2 is shown to achieve high sensitivity and specificity while reducing CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes and maintaining its detection capability upon storage at room temperature for several weeks.",Long T.

26,Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing preferences in a national cohort in the United States,"In order to understand preferences about SARS-CoV-2 testing, we conducted a discrete choice experiment among 4793 participants in the Communities, Households, and SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING COVID) Cohort Study from July 30-September 8, 2020. We used latent class analysis to identify distinct patterns of preferences related to testing and conducted a simulation to predict testing uptake if additional testing scenarios were offered. Five distinct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing emerged. Comprehensive testers (18.9%) ranked specimen type as most important and favored less invasive specimen types, with saliva most preferred, and also ranked venue and result turnaround time as highly important, with preferences for home testing and fast result turnaround time. Fast track testers (26.0%) ranked result turnaround time as most important and favored immediate and same day turnaround time. Dual testers (18.5%) ranked test type as most important and preferred both antibody and viral tests. Non-invasive dual testers (33.0%) ranked specimen type and test type as similarly most important, preferring cheek swab specimen type and both antibody and viral tests. Home testers (3.6%) ranked venue as most important and favored home-based testing. By offering less invasive (saliva specimen type), dual testing (both viral and antibody tests), and at home testing scenarios in addition to standard testing scenarios, simulation models predicted that testing uptake would increase from 81.7% to 98.1%.

27,Spotlight on the dark figure: Exhibiting dynamics in the case detection ratio of COVID-19 infections in Germany,"The case detection ratio of COVID-19 infections varies over time due to changing testing capacities, modified testing strategies and also, apparently, due to the dynamics in the number of infected itself. In this paper we investigate these dynamics by jointly looking at the reported number of detected COVID-19 infections with non-fatal and fatal outcomes in different age groups in Germany. We propose a statistical approach that allows us to spotlight the case detection ratio and quantify its changes over time. With this we can adjust the case counts reported at different time points so that they become comparable. Moreover we can explore the temporal development of the real number of infections, shedding light on the dark number. The results show that the case detection ratio has increased and, depending on the age group, is four to six times higher at the beginning of the second wave compared to what it was at the peak of the first wave. The true number of infection in Germany in October was considerably lower as during the peak of the first wave, where only a small fraction of COVID-19 infections were detected. Our modelling approach also allows quantifying the effects of different testing strategies on the case detection ratio.

We investigated the incubation period of COVID-19 with regard to age, biological sex, location, and severity of the disease. Based on the data extracted, we report an overall mean and median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 of 5.894 days and 5.598 days, respectively. The incubation period did not statistically vary for biological sex or age, but some studies suggest a longer incubation period in the young and elderly. Cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei Province of China may have a shorter incubation period for COVID-19 but the shorter incubation period may be due to an increase in viral load. In studying coronavirus strains such as SARS and MERS, researchers have discovered an inverse relationship between incubation period length and virus severity.

First, case data available to models in real-time represent a non-stationary fraction of the true case incidence due to changes in available diagnostic tests and test-seeking behavior. Second, interventions varied across time and geography leading to large changes in transmissibility over the course of the pandemic. We propose a mechanistic Bayesian model (MechBayes) that builds upon the classic compartmental susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to operationalize COVID-19 forecasting in real time. This framework includes non-parametric modeling of varying transmission rates, non-parametric modeling of case and death discrepancies due to testing and reporting issues, and a joint observation likelihood on new case counts and new deaths; it is implemented in a probabilistic programming language to automate the use of Bayesian reasoning for quantifying uncertainty in probabilistic forecasts. The model has been used to submit forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control, through the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. We examine the performance relative to a baseline model as well as alternate models submitted to the Forecast Hub. Additionally, we include an ablation test of our extensions to the classic SEIR models. We demonstrate a significant gain in both point and probabilistic forecast scoring measures using MechBayes when compared to a baseline model. We show that MechBayes ranks as one of the top models out of those submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Finally, we demonstrate that MechBayes performs significantly better than the classical SEIR model.",Graham C Gibson; Nicholas G Reich; Daniel Sheldon,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248736,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248736,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
30,Unravelling the early warning capability of wastewater surveillance for COVID-19: A temporal study on SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and need for the escalation,"Wastewater-based Epidemiological (WBE) surveillance offers a promising approach to assess the pandemic situation covering pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in highly populated area under limited clinical tests. In the present study, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7th to September 30th, 2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N (~120%) and ORF 1ab (~38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September (~924.5 copies/ L) than August (~897.5 copies/ L), corresponding to a ~ 2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better tuning the management interventions.",Manish Kumar; Madhvi Joshi; Arbind Kumar Patel; Chaitanya G Joshi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248744,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248744,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
31,"SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Florida, Illinois, and Maryland: Access and Barriers","Objective: To characterize the SARS-CoV-2 testing cascade and associated barriers in three US states. Methods: We recruited participants from Florida, Illinois, and Maryland (~1000/state) for an online survey September 16 - October 15, 2020. The survey covered demographics, COVID-19 symptoms, and experiences around SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in the prior 2 weeks. Logistic regression was used to analyze associations with outcomes of interest. Results: Overall, 316 (10%) of 3,058 respondents wanted/needed a test in the two weeks prior to the survey. Of these, 166 (53%) were able to get tested and 156 (94%) received results; 53% waited 8 or more days to get results from when they wanted/needed a test. There were no significant differences by state. Among those wanting/needing a test, getting tested was significantly less common among men (aOR: 0.46) and those reporting black race (aOR: 0.53) and more common in those reporting recent travel (aOR: 3.35). Conclusions: There is an urgent need for a national communication strategy on who should get tested and where one can get tested.

32,Forecasting intensive care unit demand during the COVID-19 pandemic: A spatial age-structured microsimulation model,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk of overburdening health care systems, and in particular intensive care units (ICUs). Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), ranging from wearing masks to (partial) lockdowns have been implemented as mitigation measures around the globe. However, especially severe NPIs are used with great caution due to their negative effects on the economy, social life and mental well-being. Thus, understanding the impact of the pandemic on ICU demand under alternative scenarios reflecting different levels of NPIs is vital for political decision-making on NPIs. Objective The aim is to support political decision-making by forecasting COVID-19-related ICU demand under alternative scenarios of COVID-19 progression reflecting different levels of NPIs. Substantial sub-national variation in COVID-19-related ICU demand requires a spatially disaggregated approach. This should not only take sub-national variation in ICU-relevant disease dynamics into account, but also variation in the population at risk including COVID-19-relevant risk characteristics (e.g. age), and factors mitigating the pandemic. The forecast provides indications for policy makers and health care stakeholders as to whether mitigation measures have to be maintained or even strengthened to prevent ICU demand from exceeding supply, or whether there is leeway to relax them. Methods We implement a spatial age-structured microsimulation model of the COVID-19 pandemic by extending the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) framework. The model accounts for regional variation in population age structure and in spatial diffusion pathways. In a first step, we calibrate the model by applying a genetic optimization algorithm against hospital data on ICU patients with COVID-19. In a second step, we forecast COVID-19-related ICU demand under alternative scenarios of COVID 19 progression reflecting different levels of NPIs. We apply the model to Germany and provide state-level forecasts over a 2-month period, which can be updated daily based on latest data on the progression of the pandemic. Results To illustrate the merits of our model, we present here forecasts of ICU demand for different stages of the pandemic during 2020. Our forecasts for a quiet summer phase with low infection rates identified quite some variation in potential for relaxing NPIs across the federal states. By contrast, our forecasts during a phase of quickly rising infection numbers in autumn (second wave) suggested that all federal states should implement additional NPIs. However, the identified needs for additional NPIs varied again across federal states. In addition, our model suggests that during large infection waves ICU demand would quickly exceed supply, if there were no NPIs in place to contain the virus. Conclusion Our results provide evidence for substantial spatial variation in (1) the effect of the pandemic on ICU demand, and (2) the potential and need for NPI adjustments at different stages of the pandemic. Forecasts with our spatial age-structured microsimulation model allow to take this spatial variation into account. The model is programmed in R and can be applied to other countries, provided that reliable data on the number of ICU patients infected with COVID-19 are available at sub-national level.",Sebastian Kluesener; Ralf Schneider; Matthias Rosenbaum-Feldbruegge; Christian Dudel; Elke Loichinger; Nikola Sander; Andreas Backhaus; Emanuele Del Fava; Janina Esins; Martina Fischer; Linus Grabenhenrich; Pavel Grigoriev; Andre Grow; Jason Hilton; Bastian Koller; Mikko Myrskyla; Francesco Scalone; Martin Wolkewitz; Emilio Zagheni; Michael M.

It focuses on the spread dynamics between Phase I (from March 23th to May 31st, 2020) and II (from June 1st to August 22th, 2020) of the social distancing measures. It also examines municipal-level factors associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths to understand the spatial determinants of the pandemic. The analysis of the geographic pattern of the pandemic via Space-Time Scan Statistics (SaTScan) revealed fast spread among municipalities. During Phase I, clusters of infections and deaths were mainly located at the center of the country, while in Phase II, these clusters dispersed to the rest of the country. The regression results from the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression analysis suggested that income inequality, prevalence of obesity and diabetes, and concentration of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) are strongly positively associated to confirmed cases and deaths regardless of lockdown.",Francisco Benita; Francisco Gasca-Sanchez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248716,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248716,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
34,On an optimal testing strategy for workplace settings operating during the COVID-19 pandemic,"High quality daily testing for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in workplace settings has become part of the standard and mandatory protection measures implemented widely in response to the current pandemic. Such tests are often limited to a small fraction of the attending personnel due to cost considerations, limited availability and processing capabilities and the often cumbersome requirements of the test itself. A maximally efficient use of such an important and frequently scarce resource is clearly required. We here present an optimal testing strategy which minimises the presence of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic members of the population, derived under a series of simplifying assumptions, which however retain many of the generalities of the problem and yield robust results, as verified through a number of numerical simulations. We show that reduction in overall infected-person-days, IPD, by significant percentages can be achieved, for fixed numbers of tests per day of 5% and 10% of the population, of 30% and 50% in the IPD numbers, respectively.",Xavier Hernandez; Sergio Valentinotti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248752,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248752,2020-12-24,2020-12-24,,True
35,"""There's No Place Like Home for The Holidays:"" Travel and SARS-CoV-2 Test Positivity Following Thanksgiving Weekend","In the US, public health officials discouraged travel and social gatherings for Thanksgiving. Data suggests that many individuals did travel over the holidays, albeit in smaller numbers than previous years. Using an online panel survey of individuals across ten US states, we found that many individuals reported spending Thanksgiving outside of their home (25.9%) or at home with at least one non-household member (27.3%). Among those who were tested, those who had Thanksgiving outside their home were significantly more likely to self-report a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior two weeks compared to those who had Thanksgiving at home with non-household members or with household members only (41.7% vs. 22.4% and 13.8%, respectively; p<0.001). Persons who had Thanksgiving outside their home and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 participated in a median 35 (IQR: 21 - 53). non-essential activities compared to those who had Thanksgiving at home and tested positive (median 3 activities, IQR 0-13). Notably, planned travel over the December holidays was most common among those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the prior 2 weeks (66.5%) compared with 25.4% of those who tested negative in the prior 2 weeks and 11.0% among those who were not tested. While public health authorities should continue promoting messages to dissuade travel and social gatherings over the holidays, as supported by these data, it is equally important to promote messaging on how to get together in a ""low-risk"" manner for those who travel and plan gatherings. In particular, it is critical that those who do travel or visit with others outside their household do so cautiously and avoid or significantly minimize all other activities where they may potentially acquire and transmit infection in the weeks prior to and after their visit.",Shruti H.

36,SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification using droplet digital RT-PCR,"Quantitative viral load assays have transformed our understanding of - and ability to manage - viral diseases. They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available. SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), yield semi-quantitative results only. Reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), a technology that partitions each reaction into 20,000 nanolitre-sized droplets prior to amplification, offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. We evaluated eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests for use in RT-ddPCR, and identified three (Charite-Berlin E-Sarbeco and Pasteur Institute IP2 and IP4) as the most efficient, precise and sensitive for RT-ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. Analytical efficiency of the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set, for example, was ~83%, while assay precision, as measured by the coefficient of variation, was ~2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quantification and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48 COVID-19-positive diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log10 range, confirming substantial viral load variation in vivo. We further calibrated RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 E gene copy numbers against cycle threshold (Ct) values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform. The resulting log-linear relationship can be used to mathematically derive SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers from Ct values, allowing the wealth of available diagnostic test data to be harnessed to address foundational questions in SARS-CoV-2 biology.",Natalie N.

37,Combined RT-qPCR and Pyrosequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Polybasic Cleavage Motif Uncovers Rare Pediatric COVID-19 Spectrum Diseases of Unusual Presentation,"Background: Surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is essential for the global containment measures with regard to the ongoing pandemic. Diagnostic gold standard is currently reverse transcription of the (+)RNA genome and subgenomic RNAs and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavages. In order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy, particularly for the reliable discrimination between negative and false-negative specimens, we propose the combination of the RT-qPCR workflow with subsequent pyrosequencing of a S-gene amplicon. This extension might add important value mainly in cases with low SARS-CoV-2 load, where RT-qPCR alone can deliver conflicting results. Results: We successfully established a combined RT-qPCR and S-gene pyrosequencing method. This method can be optionally exploited after routine diagnostics or for epidemiologic studies allowing a more reliable interpretation of conflicting RT-qPCR results. This may occur in specimens with relatively low viral loads and close to the detection limits of qPCR, practically for CT values >30. After laboratory implementation and characterization of a best practice protocol we tested the combined method in a field study on a large pediatric cohort from two German medical centers (n=769). Pyrosequencing after RT-qPCR enabled us to uncover previously unrecognized cases of pediatric COVID-19 spectrum diseases, partially exhibiting unusual and heterogeneous presentation. Moreover, it is notable that in the course of RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing method establishment when routinely confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were used we did not observe any case of false-positive diagnosis. Conclusions: The proposed protocol allows a specific and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 close to the detection limits of RT-qPCR. Combined RT-qPCR/pyrosequencing does not negatively affect preceding RT-qPCR pipeline in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and can be optionally applied in routine to inspect conflicting RT-qPCR results.",Patrick Philipp Weil; Jacqueline Hentschel; Frank Schult; Anton Pembaur; Beniam Ghebremedhin; Olivier Mboma; Andreas Heusch; Anna-Christin Reuter; Daniel Mueller; Stefan Wirth; Malik Aydin; Andreas C.

38,Identification of COVID-19-relevant transcriptional regulatory networks and associated kinases as potential therapeutic targets,"Identification of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and signaling networks involved in the response of host to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is a powerful approach that provides a systems biology view of gene expression programs involved in COVID-19 and may enable identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease. In this study, we combined a series of recently developed computational tools to identify transcriptional regulatory networks involved in the response of epithelial cells to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and particularly regulatory mechanisms that are specific to this virus. In addition, using network-guided analyses, we identified signaling pathways that are associated with these networks and kinases that may regulate them. The results identified classical antiviral response pathways including Interferon response factors (IRFs), interferons (IFNs), and JAK-STAT signaling as key elements upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to mock-treated cells. In addition, comparing SARS-Cov-2 infection of airway epithelial cells to other respiratory viruses identified pathways associated with regulation of inflammation (MAPK14) and immunity (BTK, MBX) that may contribute to exacerbate organ damage linked with complications of COVID-19.

39,No evidence for human monocyte-derived macrophage infection and antibody-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Vaccines are essential to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to protect the vulnerable population. However, one safety concern of vaccination is the possible development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential infection of Fc receptor bearing cells such as macrophages, would support continued virus replication and inflammatory responses, and thereby potentially worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 neither infect human monocyte-derived macrophages nor induce inflammatory cytokines in these cells, in sharp contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and the common cold human coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor innate immune response in human macrophages. These results support the view that ADE may not be involved in the immunopathological processes associated with COVID-19, however, more studies are necessary to understand the potential contribution of antibodies-virus complexes with other cells expressing FcR receptors.",Obdulio Garcia-Nicolas; Ferdinand Zettl; Gert Zimmer; Volker Thiel; Artur Summerfield,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423940,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423940,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
40,Host Cell Proteases Drive Early or Late SARS-CoV-2 Penetration,"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus (CoV) that spread through human populations worldwide in early 2020. CoVs rely on host cell proteases for activation and infection. The trypsin-like protease TMPRSS2 at the cell surface, cathepsin L in endolysosomes, and furin in the Golgi have all been implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 proteolytic processing. Whether SARS-CoV-2 depends on endocytosis internalization and vacuolar acidification for infectious entry remains unclear. Here, we examined the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 activation during the cell entry process in tissue culture. Using four cell lines representative of lung, colon, and kidney epithelial tissues, we found that TMPRSS2 determines the SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways. In TMPRSS2-positive cells, infection was sensitive to aprotinin, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, but not to SB412515, a drug that impairs cathepsin L. Infectious penetration was marginally dependent on endosomal acidification, and the virus passed the protease-sensitive step within 10 min. In a marked contrast, in TMPRSS2-negative cells cathepsin L and low pH were required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The cathepsin L-activated penetration occurred within 40-60 min after internalization and required intact endolysosomal functions. Importantly, pre-activation of the virus allowed it to bypass the need for endosomal acidification for viral fusion and productive entry. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other CoVs a strategy of differential use of host cell proteases for activation and infectious penetration. This study also highlights the importance of TMPRSS2 in dictating the entry pathway used by SARS-CoV-2.",Jana Koch; Zina M Uckeley; Patricio Doldan; Megan L Stanifer; Steeve Boulant; Pierre-Yves Lozach,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423906,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423906,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False

Recent work has shown that the human MARCH1, 2 and 8 are antiretroviral factors that target the Human Immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins by reducing their incorporation in the budding virions. Nevertheless, the dearth of information regarding the antiviral mechanism of this family of proteins necessitates further examination. In this study, using both the human MARCH proteins and their mouse homologues, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the antiretroviral mechanism of this family of proteins. Moreover, we show that human MARCH proteins restrict to varying degrees the envelope glycoproteins of a diverse number of viruses.

42,SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) Protein Interacts with PDZ-Domain-2 of Host Tight Junction Protein ZO1,"Newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing global pandemic leading to severe respiratory disease in humans. SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs, which can lead to amplified chloride secretion and increased leak across epithelial barriers, contributing to severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs as seen in many COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies. The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-CoV-1. Here, we screened an array of GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins using either a biotin-labeled WT or mutant ECT peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Notably, we identified a singular specific interaction between the WT E peptide and the second PDZ domain of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1), one of the key regulators of TJ formation/integrity in all epithelial tissues. We used homogenous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF) as a second complementary approach to further validate this novel modular E-ZO1 interaction. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with ZO1 in infected epithelial cells, and this interaction may contribute, in part, to tight junction damage and epithelial barrier compromise in these cell layers leading to enhanced virus spread and severe respiratory dysfunction that leads to morbidity. Prophylactic/therapeutic intervention targeting this virus-host interaction may effectively reduce airway barrier damage and mitigate virus spread.",Ariel Shepley-McTaggart; Cari A Sagum; Isabela Oliva; Elizabeth Rybakovsky; Katie DiGuilio; Jingjing Liang; Mark T Bedford; Joel Cassel; Marius Sudol; James M Mullin; Ronald N Harty,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.422708,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.422708,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False

Herein, we used X-ray crystallography to characterize an immature form of the main protease. We propose that this form preludes the cis-cleavage of N-terminal residues within the dimer, leading to the mature active site. Using fragment screening, we probe new cavities in this form which can be used to guide therapeutic development. Furthermore, we characterized a serine site-directed mutant of the main protease bound to its endogenous N and C-terminal residues during the formation of the tetramer.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the viral spike protein and affinity ligands to this surface protein have the potetial for applications as antivirals and diagnostic reagents. Here, we describe the affinity selection of cyclic peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) from three distinct libraries (in excess of a trillion molecules each) by mRNA display. We identified six high affinity molecules with dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar range (15-550 nM) to the RBD. The highest affinity ligand could be used as an affinity reagent to detect spike protein in solution by ELISA, and the co-crystal structure of this molecule bound to the RBD demonstrated that it binds to a cryptic binding site, displacing a beta-strand near the C-terminus.

45,Platycodin D prevents both lysosome- and TMPRSS2-driven SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro by hindering membrane fusion,"An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now the greatest threat to the global public health. Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention to treat COVID-19, but there has been no natural product showing inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection with detailed mechanism. Here, we show that platycodin D (PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in Platycodon grandiflorum (PG), a dietary and medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2 infection-routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry. Mechanistically, PD prevents host-entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by a pharmacological inhibition or gene-silencing of NPC1, which is mutated in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) patients displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol. Finally, readily available local foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show the similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or treating COVID-19 and that a brief disruption of membrane cholesterol can be a novel therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Tai Young Kim; Sangeun Jeon; Youngho Jang; Lizaveta Gotina; Joungha Won; Yeon Ha Ju; Sunpil Kim; Minwoo Wendy Jang; Woojin Won; Mingu Gordon Park; Ae Nim Pae; Sunkyu Han; Seungtaek Kim; C.

46,mRNA vaccine CVnCoV protects non-human primates from SARS-CoV-2 challenge infection,"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines to meet a worldwide need. mRNA-based vaccines are the most promising technology for rapid and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and production. We have designed CVnCoV, a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated, sequence optimised mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that encodes for full length, pre-fusion stabilised Spike protein. Unlike other mRNA-based approaches, CVnCoV exclusively consists of non-chemically modified nucleotides and can be applied at comparatively low doses. Here we demonstrate that CVnCoV induces robust humoral and cellular responses in non-human primates (NHPs). Animals vaccinated with 8 g of CVnCoV were protected from challenge infection with SARS-CoV-2. Comprehensive analyses of pathological changes in challenged animals via lung histopathology and Computed Tomography (CT) scans gave no indication of enhanced disease upon CVnCoV vaccination. These results demonstrate safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of CVnCoV in NHPs that extend our previously published preclinical data and provide strong support for further clinical testing in ongoing phase 2b/3 efficacy studies.",Susanne Rauch; Karen E Gooch; Yper Hall; Francisco J Salguero; Mike J Dennis; Fergus V Gleeson; Debbie Harris; Catherine Ho; Holly E Humphries; Stephanie Longet; Didier Ngabo; Jemma Paterson; Emma L Rayner; Kathryn A Ryan; Sally Sharpe; Robert J Watson; Stefan O Mueller; Benjamin Petsch; Miles W Carroll,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424138,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424138,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
47,Ferritin nanoparticle based SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine induces persistent antibody response and long-term memory in mice,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, over 200 vaccine candidates have been documented and some of them have advanced to clinical trials with encouraging results. However, the antibody persistence over 3 months post immunization and the long-term memory have been rarely reported. Here, we report that a ferritin nanoparticle based SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine induced in mice an efficient antibody response which lasts for at least 7 months post immunization. Significantly higher number of memory B cells were maintained and a significantly higher level of recall response was induced upon antigen challenge. Thus, we believe our current study provide the first information about the long-term antibody persistence and memory response of a COVID-19 vaccine. This information would be also timely useful for the development and evaluation of other vaccines.",Wenjun Wang; Baoying Huang; Yanping Zhu; Wenjie Tan; Mingzhao Zhu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423894,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423894,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
48,"Development of a novel hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 particle for rapid in vitro screening and quantification of neutralization antibodies, antiviral drugs, and viral mutations","Timely development of vaccines and antiviral drugs are critical to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Current methods for validation of vaccine efficacy involve the use of pseudoviruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) pseudotyped lentivirus or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), to quantify neutralizing antibodies for blocking viral infection. The process of pseudovirus infection and quantification is time consuming and can take days to complete. In addition, pseudoviruses contain structural proteins not native to SARS-CoV-2, which may alter particle properties in receptor binding and responses to antibody neutralization. Here we describe the development of a new hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 particle (Ha-CoV-2) for rapid screening and quantification of neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs. Ha-CoV-2 is a non-replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle, composed of only SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) and a RNA genome derived from a fast expressing alphavirus vector. We demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can rapidly and robustly express reporter genes in target cells within 3-5 hours following viral entry. We further validate the Ha-CoV-2 system for rapid quantification of neutralization antibodies and antiviral drugs. In addition, we assembled a Ha-CoV-2 particle bearing the D614G mutant spike protein, and found that the mutation led to an approximately 200% increase in virion infectivity. These results demonstrate that Ha-CoV-2 can also be applied for rapid monitoring and quantification of viral mutations for effects on neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccines.",Brian Hetrick; Sijia He; Linda D Chilin; Farhang Alem; Aarthi Narayanan; Alessandra Luchini; Tuanjie Li; Xuefeng Liu; Lance Liotta; Yuntao Wu,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423965,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423965,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
49,In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Study of Remdesivir Dry Powder for Inhalation in Hamsters,"Remdesivir dry powder for inhalation was previously developed using thin film freezing (TFF). A single dose 24 hour pharmacokinetic study in hamsters, a small animal model for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated that pulmonary delivery of TFF remdesivir can achieve plasma remdesivir and GS-441524 levels higher than the reported EC50s of both remdesivir and GS441524 (in human epithelial cells) over 20 hours. The half life of GS4412524 following dry powder insufflation was about 7 hours, suggesting the dosing regimen would be twice daily administration. Although the remdesivir-Captisol (80/20 w/w) formulation showed faster and greater absorption of remdesivir and GS-4412524 in the lung, remdesivir-leucine (80/20 w/w) exhibited a greater Cmax with shorter Tmax and lower AUC of GS441524, indicating lower total drug exposure is required to achieve a high effective concentration against SAR-CoV-2. In conclusion, remdesivir dry powder for inhalation would be a promising alternative dosage form for the treatment of COVID-19 disease.",sawittree sahakijpijarn; Chaeho Moon; Zachary N Warnken; Esther Maier; Jennie E DeVore; Dale J Christensen; John J Koleng; Robert O Williams III,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424071,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.424071,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,False
50,Low vitamin K status predicts mortality in a cohort of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"It has recently been hypothesised that Vitamin K could play a role in COVID-19. We aimed to test the hypothesis that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls; and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 140 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional Vitamin K status in peripheral tissue. Fourty-three patients died within 90-days from admission. In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels of dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) were considerably higher in patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared to controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed that increasing levels of dp-ucMGP (reflecting low Vitamin K status) were associated with higher mortality risk (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.50, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.18). In conclusion, we found that low Vitamin K status predicted mortality in patients with COVID-19 supporting a potential role of Vitamin K in COVID-19.",Allan Linneberg; Freja Bach Kampmann; Simone Bastrup Israelsen; L.

51,Digital proximity tracing app notifications lead to faster quarantine in non-household contacts: results from the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort Study,"Background: Digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps may warn exposed individuals faster than manual contact tracing (MCT), leading to earlier interruption of transmission chains through quarantine. However, it is yet unclear whether these apps lead to a reduction in transmissions under real-world conditions. This study aimed at evaluating whether the SwissCovid DPT app is effective in warning close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and prompting them to quarantine earlier. Methods: A population-based sample of adult index cases and close contacts identified through MCT and enrolled in the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort study were surveyed regarding use of the SwissCovid app and SARS-CoV-2 exposure setting. We analyzed ooutcomes related to app effectiveness and adherence (i.e., receipt and uploading of notification codes by index cases; receipt of app warnings and steps taken by close contacts). Furthermore, we performed adjusted time-to-event analyses stratified by exposure setting to estimate the effect of the app on time between relevant exposure and entering quarantine among close contacts. Findings: We included 393 index cases and 261 close contacts in the analysis. Among index cases using SwissCovid, 88% reported receiving and uploading a notification code in the app to trigger a warning among proximity contacts. Among close contacts using the app, 38% reported receiving an app warning due to the risk exposure. We found that non-household contacts who were notified by the app started quarantine at a median of 2 days after exposure, while those not notified started quarantine at a median of 3 days. In stratified multivariable analyses, app notified contacts had a greater probability of going into quarantine earlier than those without app notification (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.15-2.03). Interpretation: Our study showed that non-household contacts notified by the app started quarantine one day earlier than those not notified by the app. These findings constitute the first evidence that DPT may reach exposed contacts faster than MCT, leading to earlier quarantine and potential interruption of SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains.",Tala Ballouz; Dominik Menges; Helene E Aschmann; Anja Domenghino; Jan S Fehr; Milo A Puhan; Viktor von Wyl,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248619,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248619,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,True
52,Rapid COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Deep Learning of the Computerized Tomography Scans,"Several studies suggest that COVID-19 may be accompanied by symptoms such as a dry cough, muscle aches, sore throat, and mild to moderate respiratory illness. The symptoms of this disease indicate the fact that COVID-19 causes noticeable negative effects on the lungs. Therefore, considering the health status of the lungs using X-rays and CT scans of the chest can significantly help diagnose COVID-19 infection. Due to the fact that most of the methods that have been proposed to COVID-19 diagnose deal with the lengthy testing time and also might give more false positive and false negative results, this paper aims to review and implement artificial intelligence (AI) image-based diagnosis methods in order to detect coronavirus infection with zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates.

53,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of People living with SCI towards COVID-19 and their Psychological State during In-patient Rehabilitation in Bangladesh","Study Design: A prospective cross-sectional survey. Objective: The study aimed to examine the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of people living with Spinal cord injury (SCI) towards COVID-19 and their psychological status during in-patient rehabilitation in Bangladesh. Setting: The Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed (CRP) and the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR), two tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: From July to September 2020, a prospective, cross-sectional survey of SCI subjects, 13-78 years of age, carried out in two SCI rehab centers in Bangladesh. Data has been collected by face to face interview through a pretested, and language validated questionnaire on KAP and Depression, Anxiety, Stress (DASS). Ethical approval and trial registration obtained prospectively. As all the patients were previously living with Spinal cord injury (SCI), therefore, all the patients admitted/ attend SCI rehab centers were considered as SCI positive samples. Results: A total of 207 people with SCI responded, 87%were male, and 13% were female with mean age34.18 (SD 12.9) years. 33.8% was tetraplegic and 66.2% was paraplegic and 63.8% of them were diagnosed ASIA-A, with a motor score mean 45.38, the sensory score of 97.2, SpO2 95.07, and Vo2max 35.7 mL/kg/min. 178 people had at least one health issue. Overall knowledge score was 8.59 (SD 2.3) out of 12, depression 11.18 (SD 8), anxiety 7.72 (SD 5.1), and stress were 9.32 (SD 6.7) from a total of 21 scores each. There was a correlation between Knowledge and DASS with age (P<.05); and Knowledge with gender (P<.05), and education (P<.01). Binary logistic regression found a higher association of Knowledge and DASS with gender (OR 6.6, 6.6, .95, 6.6; P<.01); and young age (OR.418, P<.01), illiterate (OR3.81, P<.01), and rural people (OR.48, P<.05) with knowledge. A linear relation was noted between depression and anxiety scores (r.45, P<.01) and stress scores (r.58, P<.01). A positive attitude was reported for the majority of subjects. SCI Persons reported they and the caregiver followed health advisory in consulting health professionals (65.7%), isolation (63.8%), droplet precaution (87.4%), and hygiene (90.3%).

54,Bringing COVID-19 home for Christmas: a need for enhanced testing in healthcare institutions after the holidays,"Festive gatherings this 2020 holiday season threaten to cause a surge in new cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hospitals and long-term care facilities are key hotspots for COVID-19 outbreaks, and may be at elevated risk as patients and staff return from holiday celebrations in the community. Some settings and institutions have proposed fortified post-holiday testing regimes to mitigate this risk. We use an existing model to assess whether implementing a single round of post-holiday screening is sufficient to detect and manage holiday-associated spikes in COVID-19 introductions to the long-term care setting. We show that while testing early helps to detect cases prior to potential onward transmission, it likely to miss a substantial share of introductions owing to false negative test results, which are more probable early in infection. We propose a two-stage post-holiday testing regime as a means to maximize case detection and mitigate the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 outbreaks into the start of the new year. Whether all patients and staff should be screened, or only community-exposed patients, depends on available testing capacity: the former will be more effective, but also more resource-intensive.",David RM Smith; Audrey Duval; Jean Ralph Zahar; Lulla Opatowski; Laura Temime,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248460,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248460,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,True
55,"Airflow and air velocity measurements while playing wind instruments, with respect to risk assessment of a SARS-CoV-2 infection","Due to airborne transmission of infection with the coronavirus, the question arose as to how high the risk of spreading infectious particles can be while playing a wind instrument. To contribute to this question and to help clarify the possible risks, we analyzed 14 wind instruments, first qualitative by making airflows visible while playing and second quantitative by measuring air velocities at three distances (1m, 1.5m and 2m) in direction of the instruments bell. Measurements took place with wind instrumentalists of the Bamberg Symphony in their concert hall. Our findings highlight that while playing all wind instruments no airflow escaping from the instruments from the bell with brass instruments, from the mouthpiece, keyholes and bell with woodwinds was measured beyond a distance of 1.5m from the instruments bell, regardless of volume, pitch or what was played. With that, air velocity while playing corresponded to the usual value of hall-like rooms, of 0.1 m/s. For air-jet woodwinds, alto flute and piccolo, significant air movements were seen close to their mouthpieces, which escaped directly into the room without passing through the instrument and therefore generating directed air movements.",Claudia Spahn; Anna Maria Hipp; Bernd Schubert; Marcus Rudolf Axt; Markus Stratmann; Christian Schmoelder; Bernhard Richter,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248234,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248234,2020-12-23,2020-12-23,,True

57,Dynamics of a dual SARS-CoV-2 strain co-infection on a prolonged viral shedding COVID-19 case: insights into clinical severity and disease duration,"Objectives. A few molecularly proven SARS-CoV-2 cases of symptomatic reinfection are currently known worldwide, with a resolved first infection followed by a second infection after a 48 to 142-day intervening period. We report a multiple-component study of a clinically severe and prolonged viral shedding COVID-19 case in a teenager Portuguese female. She had two hospitalisations, a total of 19 RT-PCR tests, mostly positive, and criteria for releasing from home isolation at the end of 97 days. Methods. The viral genome was sequenced in seven serial samples and in the diagnostic sample from an infected close relative. A human genome-wide array (>900K) was screened on the seven samples, and in vitro culture was conducted on isolates from three late samples. Results. The patient had co-infection by two SARS-CoV-2 strains, affiliated in distinct clades and diverging by six variants. The 20A lineage was absolute at the diagnosis (shared with a cohabitating relative), but nine days later the 20B lineage had 3% frequency, and two months later the 20B lineage had 100% frequency. The 900K profiles confirmed the identity of the patient in the serial samples, and allowed us to infer that she had polygenic risk scores for hospitalization and severe respiratory disease within the normal distributions for a Portuguese population cohort.

58,Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 extracted from critical material from swabs,"ABSTRACT In consideration of the increasing prevalence of COVID-19 cases in several countries and the resulting demand for unbiased sequencing approaches, we performed a direct RNA sequencing experiment using critical oropharyngeal swab samples collected from Italian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from the Palermo region in Sicily. Here, we identified the sequences SARS-CoV-2 directly in RNA extracted from critical samples using the Oxford Nanopore MinION technology without prior cDNA retro-transcription. Using an appropriate bioinformatics pipeline, we could identify mutations in the nucleocapisid (N) gene, which have been reported previously in studies conducted in other countries. To the best of our knowledge, the technique used in this study has not been used for SARS-CoV-2 detection previously owing to the difficulties in the extraction of RNA of sufficient quantity and quality from routine oropharyngeal swabs. Despite these limitations, this approach provides the advantages of true native RNA sequencing, and does not include amplification steps that could introduce systematic errors. This study can provide novel information relevant to the current strategies adopted in SARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing.

In this study, the relationships between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 related mortality were examined. Methods: Consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR at the Hong Kong Hospital Authority between 1st January and 28th July 2020 were included. Results: This study included 2774 patients. The mortality rate of the COVID-19 positive group was 1.5% (n=42). Those who died had a higher median age (82.3[76.5-89.5] vs. 42.9[28.2-59.5] years old; P<0.0001), more likely to have baseline comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (P<0.0001). They were more frequently prescribed ACEI/ARBs at baseline, and steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and hydroxychloroquine during admission (P<0.0001). They also had a higher white cell count, higher neutrophil count, lower platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, higher D-dimer, troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression showed that age, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, the use of ACEIs/ARBs and diuretics, and various laboratory tests remained significant predictors of mortality. Conclusions: We report that an association between ACEIs/ARBs with COVID-19 related mortality even after adjusting for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, as well as medication use.

The effectiveness of outbreak testing and isolation with or without non-outbreak testing was evaluated. Methods: Using published SARS-CoV-2 transmission parameters, the fraction of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions prevented through serial testing (weekly, every three days, or daily) and isolation of asymptomatic persons compared to symptom-based testing and isolation was evaluated through mathematical modeling using a Reed-Frost model to estimate the percentage of cases prevented through either outbreak testing alone or outbreak plus non-outbreak testing. The potential effect of simultaneous decreases (by 10%) in the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals when instituting testing strategies was also evaluated. Results: Modeling suggests that outbreak testing could prevent 54% (weekly testing with 48-hour test turnaround) to 92% (daily testing with immediate results and 50% relative sensitivity) of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Adding non-outbreak testing could prevent up to an additional 8% of SARS-CoV-2 infections (depending on test frequency and turnaround time). However, added benefits of non-outbreak testing were mostly negated if accompanied by decreases in infection control practice. Conclusions: When combined with high-quality infection control practices, outbreak testing could be an effective approach to preventing COVID-19 in nursing homes, particularly if optimized through increased test frequency and use of tests with rapid turnaround.",Isaac See; Prabasaj Paul; Rachel Slayton; Molly Steele; Matthew Stuckey; Lindsey Duca; Arjun Srinivasan; Nimalie Stone; John A Jernigan; Sujan Reddy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248255,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248255,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
62,Are college campuses superspreaders? A data-driven modeling study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present enormous challenges for colleges and universities and strategies for save reopening remain a topic of ongoing debate. Many institutions that reopened cautiously in the fall experienced a massive wave of infections and colleges were soon declared as the new hotspots of the pandemic. However, the precise effects of college outbreaks on their immediate neighborhood remain largely unknown. Here we show that the first two weeks of instruction present a high-risk period for campus outbreaks and that these outbreaks tend to spread into the neighboring communities. By integrating a classical mathematical epidemiology model and Bayesian learning, we learned the dynamic reproduction number for 30 colleges from their daily case reports. Of these 30 institutions, 14 displayed a spike of infections within the first two weeks of class, with peak seven-day incidences well above 1,000 per 100,000, an order of magnitude larger than the nation-wide peaks of 70 and 150 during the first and second waves of the pandemic. While most colleges were able to rapidly reduce the number of new infections, many failed to control the spread of the virus beyond their own campus: Within only two weeks, 17 campus outbreaks translated directly into peaks of infection within their home counties. These findings suggests that college campuses are at risk to develop an extreme incidence of COVID-19 and become superspreaders for neighboring communities. We anticipate that tight test-trace-quarantine strategies, flexible transition to online instruction, and--most importantly--compliance with local regulations will be critical to ensure a safe campus reopening after the winter break.",Hannah Lu; Cortney Weintz; Joseph Pace; Dhiraj Indana; Kevin Linka; Ellen Kuhl,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248490,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248490,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
63,"Mental Disorder Prevalence Among Populations Impacted by Coronavirus Pandemics: A Multilevel Meta-Analytic Study of COVID-19, MERS & SARS","Coronavirus pandemics are associated with a number of well-documented threats, stressors and traumas that vary by impacted population and contribute to mental disorders. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemics, we investigated whether mental disorder prevalence: (a) was elevated among populations impacted by coronavirus pandemics (relative to unselected populations reported in the literature), and (b) varied by disorder (undistinguished psychiatric morbidity, anxiety, depressive, posttraumatic stress disorders [PTSD]) and impacted population (community, infected/recovered, healthcare provider, quarantined). From 60 publications (N=66,190 participants), 725 individual estimates were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to account for estimates nested within studies. Across disorder and population, the median summary point prevalence was 20% (95%CI=17-25%). Prevalence estimates were generally substantially higher than reported by prior research for unselected samples. Psychiatric morbidity and PTSD were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was found among infected/recovered adults. Notably high prevalence was found for (a) psychiatric morbidity, PTSD and depression in infected/recovered adults (25-56%), (b) psychiatric morbidity and PTSD in healthcare providers (21-29%), (c) depression and PTSD in the adults in the community (15-19%), and (d) psychiatric morbidity in quarantined adults (28%). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates were higher for studies/estimates: (1) focused on SARS or MERS versus COVID-19, (2) conducted in Hong Kong or Korea versus other locations, obtained (3) via questionnaire versus clinician assessment and (4) with standard versus non-standard scoring, and (5) of moderate or very low versus low quality. The number of mental disorders attributable to COVID-19 will be substantial and magnitudes higher than attributable to MERS and SARS due to the vast scope and ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Matthew Boden; Nicole Cohen; Jessilyn Froelich; Katherine Hoggatt; Hoda Abdel Magid; Swapandeep Mushiana,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248499,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248499,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
64,Immune-Based Prediction of COVID-19 Severity and Chronicity Decoded Using Machine Learning,"Individuals with systemic symptoms long after COVID-19 has cleared represent approximately 10% of all COVID-19 infected individuals. Here we present a bioinformatics approach to predict and model the phases of COVID so that effective treatment strategies can be devised and monitored. We investigated 144 individuals including normal individuals and patients spanning the COVID-19 disease continuum. We collected plasma and isolated PBMCs from 29 normal individuals, 26 individuals with mild-moderate COVID-19, 25 individuals with severe COVID-19, and 64 individuals with Chronic COVID-19 symptoms. Immune subset profiling and a 14-plex cytokine panel were run on all patients. Data was analyzed using machine learning methods to predict and distinguish the groups from each other. Using a multi-class deep neural network classifier to better fit our prediction model, we recapitulated a 100% precision, 100% recall and F1 score of 1 on the test set. Moreover, a first score specific for the chronic COVID-19 patients was defined as S1 = (IFN- {gamma} ; + IL-2 )/ CCL4-MIP-1 {beta} ;. Second, a score specific for the severe COVID-19 patients was defined as S2 = (10 xIL-10 + IL-6) - (IL-2 + IL-8). Severe cases are characterized by excessive inflammation and dysregulated T cell activation, recruitment, and counteracting activities. While chronic patients are characterized by a profile able to induce the activation of effector T cells with pro-inflammatory properties and the capacity of generating an effective immune response to eliminate the virus but without the proper recruitment signals to attract activated T cells.",Bruce Patterson; Jose Guevara-Coto; Ram Yogendra; Edgar B.

65,An atlas connecting shared genetic architecture of human diseases and molecular phenotypes provides insight into COVID-19 susceptibility,"While genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) have successfully elucidated the genetic architecture of complex human traits and diseases, understanding mechanisms that lead from genetic variation to pathophysiology remains an important challenge. Methods are needed to systematically bridge this crucial gap to facilitate experimental testing of hypotheses and translation to clinical utility. Here, we leveraged cross-phenotype associations to identify traits with shared genetic architecture, using linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to accurately capture shared SNPs by proxy, and calculate significance of enrichment. This shared genetic architecture was examined across differing biological scales through incorporating data from catalogs of clinical, cellular, and molecular GWAS. We have created an interactive web database (interactive Cross-Phenotype Analysis of GWAS database (iCPAGdb); http://cpag.oit.duke.edu) to facilitate exploration and allow rapid analysis of user-uploaded GWAS summary statistics. This database revealed well-known relationships among phenotypes, as well as the generation of novel hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of common diseases. Application of iCPAGdb to a recent GWAS of severe COVID-19 demonstrated unexpected overlap of GWAS signals between COVID-19 and human diseases, including with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis driven by the DPP9 locus. Transcriptomics from peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that DPP9 was induced in SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy controls or those with bacterial infection. Further investigation of cross-phenotype SNPs with severe COVID-19 demonstrated colocalization of the GWAS signal of the ABO locus with plasma protein levels of a reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2, CD209 (DC-SIGN), pointing to a possible mechanism whereby glycosylation of CD209 by ABO may regulate COVID-19 disease severity. Thus, connecting genetically related traits across phenotypic scales links human diseases to molecular and cellular measurements that can reveal mechanisms and lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.",Liuyang Wang; Thomas J Balmat; Alejandro L Antonia; Florica J Constantine; Ricardo Henao; Thomas W Burke; Andy Ingham; Micah T McClain; Ephraim L Tsalik; Emily R Ko; Geoffrey Ginsburg; Mark DeLong; Xiling Shen; Christopher W Woods; Elizabeth R Hauser; Dennis C Ko,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248572,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248572,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
66,Kinetics of antibody responses dictate COVID-19 outcome,"Recent studies have provided insights into innate and adaptive immune dynamics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, the exact feature of antibody responses that governs COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. Here, we analysed humoral immune responses in 209 asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-Spike (S) IgG levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. While high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time-dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than live discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed response, measured by anti-S, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels, compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, while sera from 89% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation prior to 14 days of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se, but rather with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.",Carolina Lucas; Jon Klein; Maria Sundaram; Feimei Lu; Patrick Wong; Julio Silva; Tianyang Mao; Ji Eun Oh; Maria Tokuyama; Peiwen Lu; Arvind Venkataraman; Annsea Park; Benjamin Israelow; Anne Wyllie; Chantal Vogels; M.

67,Cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with distinct transcriptomic changes within the heart,"Background Analyses in hospitalized patients and small autopsy series suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect the heart. We investigated heart tissue by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19. Methods Left ventricular tissue from 95 deceased with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing autopsy was analyzed and clinical data were collected. RNA was isolated to examine virus load of SARS-CoV-2 and its replication in the heart. A virus load >1000 copies per {micro}g RNA was defined as relevant. Viral RNA and inflammatory cells were assessed using histology. RNA sequencing and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were performed in 10 cases with high cardiac virus load and 10 age-matched cases without cardiac infection. Results A relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load was detected in 41 out of 95 deceased (43%). The median cardiac virus load was 7952 copies per {micro}g RNA (IQR 2507, 32 005). In situ hybridization revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA primarily in the interstitium or interstitial cells. Virus detection was not associated with increased inflammatory cells. Relevant cardiac infection was associated with increased expression of the entry factor TMPRSS2. Cardiac virus replication was found in 14/95 hearts (15%). Remarkably, cardiac virus replication was associated with shorter time between diagnosis and death. RNA sequencing revealed clear activation of immune response pathways to virus infection and destruction of cardiomyocytes. Hearts with high virus load showed activation of the GO term ''extracellular exosomes''. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 infection including virus replication and distinct transcriptomic alterations without signs of myocarditis demonstrate a cardiac involvement. In this autopsy series, cardiac replication of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with early death.",Diana Lindner; Hanna Braeuninger; Bastian Stoffers; Antonia Fitzek; Kira Meissner; Ganna Aleshcheva; Michaela Schweizer; Jessica Weimann; Bjoern Rotter; Svenja Warnke; Carolin Edler; Fabian Braun; Kevin Roedl; Katharina Scherschel; Felicitas Escher; Stefan Kluge; Tobias B.

68,Identifying Sequential Complication and Mortality Patterns in Diabetes Mellitus: Comparisons of Machine Learning Methodologies,"Background: Diabetes mellitus-related complications adversely affect the quality of life. Better risk-stratified care through mining of sequential complication patterns is needed to enable early detection and prevention. Methods: Univariable and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant variables that can predict mortality. A sequence analysis method termed Prefixspan was applied to identify the most common couple, triple, quadruple, quintuple and sextuple sequential complication patterns in the directed comorbidity pathology network. A knowledge enhanced CPT+ (KCPT+) sequence prediction model is developed to predict the next possible outcome along the progression trajectories of diabetes-related complications. Findings: A total of 14,144 diabetic patients (51% males) were included. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without known ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (odds ratio [OR]: 2.8, 95% CI: [2.3, 3.4]), peripheral vascular disease (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: [1.9, 2.8]), dementia (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: [1.8, 2.4]), and IHD with AMI (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: [2.1, 2.6]) are the most important multivariate predictors of mortality. KCPT+ shows high accuracy in predicting mortality (F1 score 0.90, ACU 0.88), osteoporosis (F1 score 0.86, AUC 0.82), ophthalmological complications (F1 score 0.82, AUC 0.82), IHD with AMI (F1 score 0.81, AUC 0.85) and neurological complications (F1 score 0.81, AUC 0.83) with a particular prior complication sequence. Interpretation: Sequence analysis identifies the most common pattern characteristics of disease-related complications efficiently. The proposed sequence prediction model is accurate and enables clinicians to diagnose the next complication earlier, provide better risk-stratified care, and devise efficient treatment strategies for diabetes mellitus patients.",Jiandong Zhou; Sharen Lee; Wing Tak Wong; Tong Liu; Leonardo Roever; Kamalan Jeevaratnam; William KK Wu; Ian CK Wong; Gary Tse; Qingpeng Zhang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248646,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248646,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
69,The Association Between Alpha-1 Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists and In-Hospital Mortality from COVID-19,"Effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed, and preclinical data suggest alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (1-AR antagonists) may be effective in reducing mortality related to hyperinflammation. Using a retrospective cohort design with patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system, we use doubly robust regression and matching to estimate the association between use of 1-AR antagonists at time of hospitalization and likelihood of death due to COVID-19 during an inpatient stay. Having an active prescription for an 1-AR antagonist (tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or alfuzosin) at the time of admission had a significant negative association with in-hospital mortality (relative risk reduction 14%; odds ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86; p [&le;] 0.001).

71,Population risk factors for severe disease and mortality in COVID-19: A global systematic review and meta-analysis,"Aim: COVID-19 clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe cases. While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Methods: The systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) for relevant literature published between 1st January 2020 and 9th July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable. Results: Seventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR {equiv} 2.65 (1.81-3.90)), male sex (OR {equiv} 2.05(1.39-3.04)) and severe obesity (OR {equiv} 2.57 (1.31-5.05)). Active cancer (OR {equiv} 1.46 (1.04-2.04)) was associated with increased risk of severe outcome. A number of common symptoms and vital measures (respiratory rate and SpO2) also suggested elevated risk profiles.

72,A New Extension of State-Space SIR Model to Account for Underreporting- An Application to the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida,"In the absence of sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19, a substantial number of infecteds are expected to remain undetected. Since the undetected cases are not quarantined, they are expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined counterparts. That is, under the lack of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection may be entirely different from that being reported. Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported) cases be considered while estimating the parameters and forecasting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. In this paper, we have developed a new version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered- deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to incorporate the impact of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure.

However, little is known about the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on confined vehicles, such as airplanes and trains. Based on the itinerary and epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases and close contacts among 9,265 airline passengers on 291 airplanes and 29,335 passengers on 830 high-speed trains in China from December 20, 2019 to March 17, 2020, we estimated that the upper bound of overall attack rate of COVID-19 among passengers was 0.60% (95% confidence interval: 0.43%-0.84%) for airplanes and 0.35% (0.28%-0.44%) for trains departing from Wuhan before its lockdown, respectively. The reproduction number during travel ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 on airplanes and from 0.07 to 0.12 on trains, with the risk varying by seat distance from the index case and joint travel time, but the difference in risk was not significant between the types of aircraft and train. Overall, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on planes and high-speed trains with high efficiency air filtration devices was relatively low.

74,Airborne Transmission of Virus-Laden Aerosols inside a Music Classroom: Effects of Portable Purifiers and Aerosol Injection Rates,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shifted attention to the airborne transmission of small exhaled droplet nuclei within indoor environments such as classrooms. The spread of aerosols through singing and musical instruments in music performances has necessitated the need for utilizing precautionary methods such as masks and portable purifiers. This study investigates the effects of placing portable air purifiers at different locations inside a classroom, as well as the effects of different aerosol injection rates (e.g., with and without masks, different musical instruments etc.). The time varying deposition of aerosols on the walls and the airborne aerosol concentration are analyzed in this study. It was found that proper placement of purifiers could offer a significant advantage in reducing airborne aerosol numbers (offering orders of magnitude higher aerosol removal when compared to having no purifiers, where the removal is sometimes nearly zero), while improper placement of the purifiers could worsen the situation. It was concluded that in general, the purifier should be placed as close to the injector as possible in order to yield a benefit, and also away from the people to be protected. Moreover, using purifiers could help in achieving ventilation rates close to the prescribed values by WHO, while also achieving aerosol removal times within the CDC recommended guidelines. This could help in deciding effective break periods between classroom sessions, which was found to be around 25 minutes through this study. The injection rate was found to have an almost linear correlation with the average airborne aerosol suspension rate and aerosol surface deposition rate, which could be used to predict the trends for scenarios with other injection rates.",Sai Ranjeet Narayanan; Suo Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248374,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248374,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

76,"CovidSIMVL -- Transmission Trees, Superspreaders and Contact Tracing in Agent Based Models of Covid-19","The agent-based model CovidSIMVL (github.com/ecsendmail/MultiverseContagion) is employed in this paper to delineate different network structures of transmission chains in simulated COVID-19 epidemics, where initial parameters are set to approximate spread from a single transmission source, and R0 ranges between 1.5 and 2.5. The resulting Transmission Trees are characterized by breadth, depth and generations needed to reach a target of 50% infected from a starting population of 100, or self-extinction prior to reaching that target. Metrics reflecting efficiency of an epidemic relate closely to topology of the trees. It can be shown that the notion of superspreading individuals may be a statistical artefact of Transmission Tree growth, while superspreader events can be readily simulated with appropriate parameter settings. The potential use of contact tracing data to identify chain length and shared paths is explored as a measure of epidemic progression. This characterization of epidemics in terms of topological characteristics of Transmission Trees may complement equation-based models that work from rates of infection. By constructing measures of efficiency of spread based on Transmission Tree topology and distribution, rather than rates of infection over time, the agent-based approach may provide a method to characterize and project risks associated with collections of transmission events, most notably at relatively early epidemic stages, when rates are low and equation-based approaches are challenged in their capacity to describe or predict.",Ernie Chang; Kenneth Andrew Moselle; Ashlin Richardson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248673,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248673,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
77,"When might Host Heterogeneity Drive the Evolution of Asymptomatic, Pandemic Coronaviruses?","For most emerging infectious diseases, including SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pharmaceutical intervensions such as drugs and vaccines are not available, and disease surveillance followed by isolating, contact-tracing and quarantining infectious individuals is critical for controlling outbreaks. These interventions often begin by identifying symptomatic individuals. However, by actively removing pathogen strains likely to be symptomatic, such interventions may inadvertently select for strains less likely to result in symptomatic infections. Additionally, the pathogen's fitness landscape is structured around a heterogeneous host pool. In particular, uneven surveillance efforts and distinct transmission risks across host classes can drastically alter selection pressures. Here we explore this interplay between evolution caused by disease control efforts, on the one hand, and host heterogeneity in the efficacy of public health interventions on the other, on the potential for a less symptomatic, but widespread, pathogen to evolve. We use an evolutionary epidemiology model parameterized for SARS-CoV-2, as the widespread potential for silent transmission by asymptomatic hosts has been hypothesized to account, in part, for its rapid global spread. We show that relying on symptoms-driven reporting for disease control ultimately shifts the pathogen's fitness landscape and can cause pandemics. We find such outcomes result when isolation and quarantine efforts are intense, but insufficient for suppression. We further show that when host removal depends on the prevalence of symptomatic infections, intense isolation efforts can select for the emergence and extensive spread of more asymptomatic strains. The severity of selection pressure on pathogens caused by these interventions likely lies somewhere between the extremes of no intervention and thoroughly successful eradication. Identifying the levels of public health responses that facilitate selection for asymptomatic pathogen strains is therefore critical for calibrating disease suppression and surveillance efforts and for sustainably managing emerging infectious diseases.",Kenichi W.

Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 13 to May 5, 2020. Adult residents of Greece anonymously completed an online survey that was distributed through email and social media. A total of 1396 fully complete questionnaires were collected. Demographic questions, questions regarding the knowledge about the disease etiology, diagnosis and prevention, and questions related to the respondents' attitude and perception toward the restriction measures and the confidence in different kinds of institutions providing information were included in the survey items. The appropriate statistical analyses were conducted according to the type of variable and the research question. Results: The highest knowledge scores were found in females (74.8%, p = 0.015), individuals over 60 years old (77.3%, p<0.001) and individuals having completed post-secondary or tertiary education (76.5%, p<0.001). Five attitude patterns toward the pandemic were identified: 'trust in institutions', 'trust in the restriction measures', 'trust in media and the internet', 'trust in traditional institutions', and 'measures deniers'. Age, education, and knowledge score were the factors defining the attitudinal patterns revealed.

79,Risk of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in Egyptian quarantine hospitals,"In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Egypt adopted a unique care model based on quarantine hospitals for Covid-19 patients, with dedicated medical teams residing in the hospital days and nights during working shifts. However, the impact of this approach on the infection risk for healthcare workers (HCWs) is uncertain. Based on data collected within two quarantine hospitals located in Cairo, Egypt, we compute the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers (HCWs) using a model-based approach that accounts for variability in false-negative rates of RT-PCR tests. We estimate the probability for an HCW to be infected at the end of a working shift at 12.8% (95% CrI: 7.6%-19.5%) for a 2-week shift at Hospital 1, whereas a higher probability of 48.2% (95%CrI: 23.8%-74.5%) was found for a 7-day shift at Hospital 2. The large variation in the infection risk we describe between the two hospitals we studied suggests that HCWs from quarantine hospitals may face a high risk of infection, but that, with sufficient anticipation and infection control measures, this risk can be brought down to levels similar to those observed in standard healthcare settings.",Sofia Jijon; Ahmad Al Shafie; Laura Temime; Kevin Jean; Mohamed El Kassas; - the EMEA-MESuRS working group on nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 modelling,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248594,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248594,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
80,Preventing a cluster from becoming a new wave in settings with zero community COVID-19 cases,"In settings with zero community transmission, any new SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are likely to be the result of random incursions. The level of restrictions in place at the time of the incursion is likely to considerably affect possible outbreak trajectories. We used an agent-based model to investigate the relationship between ongoing restrictions and behavioural factors, and the probability of an incursion causing an outbreak and the resulting growth rate. We applied our model to the state of Victoria, Australia, which has reached zero community transmission as of November 2020. We found that a future incursion has a 45% probability of causing an outbreak (defined as a 7-day average of >5 new cases per day within 60 days) if no restrictions were in place, decreasing to 23% with a mandatory masks policy, density restrictions on venues such as restaurants, and if employees worked from home where possible. A drop in community symptomatic testing rates was associated with up to a 10-percentage point increase in outbreak probability, highlighting the importance of maintaining high testing rates as part of a suppression strategy. Because the chance of an incursion occurring is closely related to border controls, outbreak risk management strategies require an integrated approaching spanning border controls, ongoing restrictions, and plans for response. Each individual restriction or control strategy reduces the risk of an outbreak. They can be traded off against each other, but if too many are removed there is a danger of accumulating an unsafe level of risk. The outbreak probabilities estimated in this study are of particular relevance in assessing the downstream risks associated with increased international travel.",Romesh G Abeysuriya; Dominic Delport; Robyn Margaret Stuart; Rachel Sacks-Davis; Cliff C Kerr; Dina Mistry; Daniel J Klein; Margaret Hellard; Nick Scott,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248595,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248595,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
81,"COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Ukraine after September 1, 2020","Background. The threats of the COVID-19 pandemic require the mobilization of scientists, including mathematicians. To understand how the number of cases increases versus time, various models based on direct observations of a random number of new cases and differential equations can be used. Complex mathematical models contain many unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations of the disease over time. Even long-term monitoring of the epidemic may not provide reliable estimates of its parameters due to the constant change of testing conditions, isolation of infected and quarantine. Therefore, simpler approaches should also be used, for example, some smoothing of the dependence of the number of cases on time and the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. These approaches allowed to detect the waves of pandemic in different countries and regions and to make adequate predictions of the duration, hidden periods, reproduction numbers, and final sizes of its waves. In particular, seven waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine were investigated. Objective. We will detect new epidemic waves in Ukraine that occurred after September 1, 2020 and estimate the epidemic characteristics with the use of generalized SIR model. Some predictions of the epidemic dynamics will be presented. Methods. In this study we use the smoothing method for the dependence of the number of cases on time; the generalized SIR model for the dynamics of any epidemic wave, the exact solution of the linear differential equations and statistical approach developed before. Results. Seventh and eights epidemic waves in Ukraine were detected and the reasons of their appearance were discussed. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were calculated. The prediction for the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Ukraine is not very optimistic: new cases will not stop appearing until June 2021. Only mass vaccination and social distancing can change this trend. Conclusions. New waves of COVID-19 pandemic can be detected, calculated and predicted with the use of rather simple mathematical simulations. The expected long duration of the pandemic forces us to be careful and in solidarity.The government and all Ukrainians must strictly adhere to quarantine measures in order to avoid fatal consequences.",Igor Nesteruk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248627,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248627,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
82,Optimal strategies for combining vaccine prioritization and social distancing to reduce hospitalizations and mitigate COVID19 progression,"Social distancing is an effective population-level mitigation strategy to prevent COVID19 propagation but it does not reduce the number of susceptible individuals and bears severe economic and psychological consequences. A vaccine has recently been developed but its deployment will be limited and not immediate. Designing an optimal combination of these two intervention strategies is a priority, but a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between these strategies is missing. To tackle this challenge we developed an age-structured deterministic model in which vaccines are deployed during the pandemic to individuals who, in the eye of public health, are susceptible (do not show symptoms). The model allows for flexible and dynamic prioritization strategies with shifts between target groups. We find that social distancing applied uniformly to all ages and with vaccination targeted towards adults (20-59) or elderly (60+) work in synergism but up to a threshold beyond which vaccination is not efficient. The inefficiency threshold can be eliminated by targeting social distancing at the age groups that are not vaccinated and the optimal strategy is to prioritize vaccines to elderly. Nevertheless, while vaccination reduces hospitalizations, it does not affect the time it takes to eliminate the virus from the population, which is affected only by social distancing. Finally, the same reduction in hospitalization can be achieved via different combination of strategies, giving decision makers flexibility in choosing public health policies. Our study provides insights into the factors that affect vaccination success and provides methodology to test different intervention strategies in a way that will align with ethical guidelines.",Sharon Guerstein; Victoria Romeo-Aznar; Ma'ayan Dekel; Oren Miron; Nadav Davidovitch; Rami Puzis; Shai Pilosof,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248622,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248622,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
83,COVID-19 control measure effects suggest excess winter mortality is more sensitive to infection control than warmer temperatures.,"Background: Excess winter mortality (EWM) has been attributed to both seasonal cold exposure, and to infectious disease. In 2020, New Zealand's border management and lockdown measures successfully eliminated community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and also largely eliminated influenza and many other respiratory viruses. This study investigates the contribution of infections and temperature to EWM and typical extended winter (May to October) deaths in this natural experiment created by New Zealand's COVID-19 pandemic response. Methods: We used age-standardised weekly deaths to measure EWM 2011 to 2019, then used historical patterns to estimate high, medium and low scenario 2020 EWMs. We then modelled typical year and 2020 heating degree day: mortality relationships to estimate relative contributions of cold temperature and infection to typical extended winter deaths. Results: EWM 2011 to 2019 averaged 14.7% (low 11.4%, high 20.9%). In contrast, 2020 EWM was estimated at 1.6%, 2.7%, or 3.8% under high, medium, and low spring-summer mortality scenarios. Between 2011 and 2019, temperature was estimated to explain 47% of extended winter deaths, and infection 27%, with the remaining 26% attributable to the interaction between infection and temperature. Discussion: The society-wide response to COVID-19 in 2020 resulted in a major reduction of winter mortality in this high-income nation with a temperate climate. In addition to influenza, other respiratory pathogens likely also make a significant contribution to EWM. Low cost protection measures such as mask wearing (eg, in residential care facilities), discouragement of sick presenteeism, and increased influenza vaccine coverage, all have potential to reduce future winter mortality.",Lucy Telfar-Barnard; Michael G Baker; Amanda Kvalsvig; Nick Wilson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248531,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248531,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
84,How optimal allocation of limited testing capacity changes epidemic dynamics,"Insufficient testing capacity continues to be a critical bottleneck in the worldwide fight against COVID-19. Optimizing the deployment of limited testing resources has therefore emerged as a keystone problem in pandemic response planning. Here, we use a modified SEIR model to optimize testing strategies under a constraint of limited testing capacity. We define pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic infected classes, and assume that positively tested individuals are immediately moved into quarantine. We further define two types of testing. Clinical testing focuses only on the symptomatic class. Non-clinical testing detects pre- and asymptomatic individuals from the general population, and an ``information'' parameter governs the degree to which such testing can be focused on high infection risk individuals. We then solve for the optimal mix of clinical and non-clinical testing as a function of both testing capacity and the information parameter. We find that purely clinical testing is optimal at very low testing capacities, supporting early guidance to ration tests for the sickest patients. Additionally, we find that a mix of clinical and non-clinical testing becomes optimal as testing capacity increases. At high but empirically observed testing capacities, a mix of clinical testing and unfocused (information=0) non-clinical testing becomes optimal. We further highlight the advantages of early implementation of testing programs, and of combining optimized testing with contact reduction interventions such as lockdowns, social distancing, and masking.",Justin M Calabrese; Jeffery Demers,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248431,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248431,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

However, scant research has addressed this topic in Japan. Materials and Methods: In this modelling exercise, we extracted the number of daily reported cases of COVID-19 in Okinawa from October 1 to November 30, 2020 and explored possible scenarios for decreasing COVID-19 incidence by combining population-wide screening and/or social distancing policy. Results: We reveal that permanent lockdown can be replaced by mass testing that mobilizes sufficient target population at an adequate frequency. In addition, solely imposing a circuit breaker will not bring a favorable outcome in the long-term, and mass testing presents implications for minimizing a period of lockdown.

Methods: this works presents an expression to estimate the number of remaining susceptible in a population using the observed number of SARS-CoV-2 related deaths and current estimates of R0 and IFR. Results: the epidemic will infect most of the population causing 2.5 deaths per thousand inhabitants on average, and herd immunity will be achieved when the number of deaths per thousand inhabitants is close to two. This work introduces an expression to provide estimates of the number of remaining susceptible in a region using the reported number of deaths. Conclusions: any region with fewer than 2.5 deaths per thousand individuals will continue accumulating deaths until this average is achieved, and the infection rate will exceed the removal rate until the number of deaths is about two deaths per thousand, when herd immunity is reached.

88,Routine SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance results in Turkey to follow Covid-19 outbreak,"A global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) declared by WHO in March 2019 is still ongoing. As of 13th of December 2020, 70 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 1.5 million people lost their lives globally (WHO, 2020). Since March 2019, diagnosis of Covid-19 cases has been done through PCR test of samples from nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. However, in March 2019, it was reported that the faeces [1] and urine [2] of all infected people contain SARS-CoV-2. Later, numerous researchers [3-7] detected SARS-CoV-2 in faeces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Moreover, some studies [1,4,8-12] suggested the possibility of extended duration of viral shedding in faeces after the patients respiratory samples tested negative. In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), i.e., wastewater surveillance, aiming to estimate the distribution of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a specific region has received worldwide attention. Various research groups worldwide [1, 13-54] have started SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater since WBE provides tracking whole population by testing a small number of wastewater samples in a specific region and can predict SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human faeces a few days to a week before onset of symptoms. This makes WBE quite economic tool for continual tracking of decreasing or increasing trend of the Covid-19 in a particular region. However, up to date, almost all of the WBE studies have been performed with samples from a few treatment plants. There was no reported nationwide wastewater surveillance study that has been integrated into a national Covid-19 management strategy by decision makers. Nationwide, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies have great potential to reflect the actual distribution of Covid-19 cases in a community by accounting not only symptomatic patients tested but also asymptomatic patients having no or mild symptoms and not been tested. As opposed to clinical surveillance studies, wastewater-based surveillance studies will reflect the number of cases in a community by testing one sample from a treatment plant serving this community instead of performing individual swab tests. Turkey, which is among the few countries that started wastewater based surveillance studies at the early stages of pandemic is a leading country, performing a nationwide surveillance study. The distribution of Covid-19 cases throughout the country via SARS-CoV-2 measurements in influent, effluent and sludge samples of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in 81 cities through May 2020- June 2020 was conducted [36, 51, 52]. In June 2020, nationwide routine sampling through 22 regional identified cities has been started. However, from June to September 2020 all samples were detected negative due to problems with RT-pCR primer targeting RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Since September 2020, routine sampling from 22 cities of Turkey with 2 weeks sampling period (weekly for mega city Istanbul) has been continued and regional Covid-19 distributions have been reported as viral loads on color-scale maps.

Day cases (no overnight stay) dropped by around 37% per week. Both admissions and discharges for inpatients (at least one overnight stay) decreased leading to a small reduction in hospital bed days but no reduction in hospital bed nights. The effect on hospital activity on different patient groups varied substantially with some groups such as medical oncology day cases increasing by 13%. As a result, the patient case mix in the hospital was very different during the pandemic. Overall weekly medication administrations decreased for day cases and inpatients, but weekly medication administrations per bed day increased by 10% for day cases and 6% for inpatients. Conclusions Despite not being badly affected by the disease itself, specialist paediatric hospital services have been greatly affected by the pandemic. The average number of medications per inpatient bed day increased, likely reflecting changes to the patient population, with only those children with severe conditions being treated during the pandemic.

There is a need to characterize which HCWs are at increased risk of psychological sequela from the pandemic. Methods: HCWs across seven hospitals in New York City were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational digital study using the custom Warrior Watch Study App. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study measuring HRV throughout the follow up period. Surveys were obtained daily. Results: Three hundred and sixty-one HCWs were enrolled. Multivariable analysis found New York City COVID-19 case count to be significantly associated with increased longitudinal stress (p=0.008). A non-significant decrease in stress (p=0.23) was observed following COVID-19 diagnosis, though there was a borderline significant increase following the 4-week period after a COVID-19 diagnosis via nasal PCR (p=0.05). Baseline emotional support, baseline quality of life and baseline resilience were associated with decreased longitudinal stress (p<0.001). Baseline resilience and emotional support were found to buffer against stressors, with a significant reduction in stress during the 4-week period after COVID-19 diagnosis observed only in participants in the highest tertial of emotional support and resilience (effect estimate -0.97, p=0.03; estimate -1.78, p=0.006). A significant trend between New York City COVID-19 case count and longitudinal stress was observed only in the high tertial emotional support group (estimate 1.22, p=0.005), and was borderline significant in the high and medium resilience tertials (estimate 1.29, p=0.098; estimate 1.14, p=0.09). Participants in the highest tertial of baseline emotional support and resilience had significantly reduced amplitude and acrophase of the circadian pattern of longitudinally collected heart rate variability. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that low resilience, emotional support, and quality of life identify HCWs at risk of high perceived longitudinal stress secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic and have a distinct physiological stress profile. Assessment of HCWs for these features can identify and permit allocation of psychological support to these at-risk individuals as the COVID-19 pandemic and its psychological effects continue in this vulnerable population.",Robert P Hirten; Matteo Danieletto; Lewis Tomalin; Katie Hyewon Choi; Micol Zweig; Eddye Golden; Sparshdeep Kaur; Drew Helmus; Anthony Biello; Renata Pyzik; Claudia Calcogna; Robert Freeman; Bruce E Sands; Dennis Charney; Erwin P Bottinger; Laurie Keefer; Mayte Suarez Farinas; Girish Nadkarni; Zahi A Fayad,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248593,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248593,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
95,Time use and social mixing during and around festive periods: Potential changes in the age distribution of COVID-19 cases from increased intergenerational interactions,"Rationale Amid the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in which many countries have adopted physical distancing measures, tiered restrictions, and episodic ""lockdowns"", the impact of potentially increased social mixing during festive holidays on the age distribution of new COVID-19 cases remains unclear. Objective We aimed to gain insights into possible changes in the age distribution of COVID-19 cases in the UK after temporarily increased intergenerational interactions in late December 2020. Method We modelled changes in time use and social mixing based on age-stratified contact rates using historical nationally-representative surveys and up-to-date Google mobility data from four weeks before and after the festive period. We explored changes in the effective reproduction number and the age distribution of cases, in four scenarios: (1) ""normal"": time use and contact patterns as observed historically, (2) ""pre-lockdown"": patterns as seen before the lockdown in November 2020, (3) ""lockdown"": patterns restricted as in November 2020, and (4) ""festive break"": similar to 3 but with social visits over the holiday period as in 1. Results Across ages, the estimated Reff decreases during the festive break in scenarios 1-3 and returns to pre-holiday levels in scenarios 2-3, while remaining relatively stable in scenario 4. Relative incidence is likely to decrease in children aged 0-15 but increase in other ages. Changes in age distribution were large during the holidays, and are likely to start before the holidays for individuals aged 16-24 years in scenarios 1-3. Conclusions Our modelling findings suggest that increased contacts during the festive period may shift the age distribution of COVID-19 cases from children towards adults. Given that COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths rise by age, more intergenerational mixing risks an increased burden in the period following the holidays.",Edwin van Leeuwen; Frank G.

96,Experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional analysis of risk perceptions and mental health in a student cohort,"Objective: This study examined the COVID-19 risk perceptions and mental health of university students on returning to campus in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online survey was completed during the first four weeks of the academic year (October 2020) by 897 university students. The survey included demographics and measures of experiences of COVID-19 testing, self-isolation, shielding, perceived risk, mental health and indices capturing related psychological responses to the pandemic. Results: We observed higher levels of depression and anxiety, but not stress, in students compared with pre-pandemic normative data, but lower than levels reported earlier in the pandemic in other similar cohorts. Depression, anxiety and stress were independently associated with greater loneliness and reduced positive mood. Greater worry about COVID-19 was also independently associated with anxiety and stress. Female students and those with pre-existing mental health disorders were at greatest risk of poor mental health outcomes. Conclusion: Although students perceived themselves at only moderate risk of COVID-19, the prevalence of depression and anxiety among university students should remain a concern. Universities should provide adequate support for students mental health during term-time. Interventions to reduced loneliness and worry, and improve mood, may benefit students overall mental well-being.",Ru Jia; Holly Knight; Holly Blake; Jessica Corner; Chris Denning; Jonathan Ball; Kirsty Bolton; Joanne R Morling; Carol Coupland; Grazziela Figueredo; David Ed Morris; Patrick Tighe; Armando Villalon; Kieran Aylling; Kavita Vedhara,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248467,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248467,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

98,Telehealth Applied to Deliver In Situ Behavioral Skills Training to Reduce Car Seat Misuse During the CovidAcc19 Pandemic,"Objective The use of telehealth has been a common approach to deliver health education before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its ability to apply behavioral skills training (BST) for CRS education has been undocumented. This study assessed the efficacy of telehealth to deliver in-situ behavioral skills training (BST) to teach expectant parents how to install and use their child restraint system (CRS) to reduce misuse and improve retention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A repeated measures group design was used to evaluate 171 individual participants, in a 37-step CRS task analysis for baseline, BST, and follow-up. Performance across all participants was aggregated for each task analysis. Participants were recruited from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration car seat fitting stations during the Covid-19 pandemic between March through July, 2020. Results Baseline results identified significant critical misuse across participants. With BST, delivered with telehealth, misuse decreased by 97% among 37 task objectives. A 2-week follow-up evaluation concluded that 100% of participants retained the skills they mastered during BST. Conclusions This study suggests the use of telehealth, as a method of BST delivery for CRS education, is an effective approach to reduce CRS misuse and the burden of child occupant motor vehicle injury. It was found to empower participants and improve their self-confidence, while ensuring the safety of their child occupant. While it was found to be an effective approach for expectant parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, it also has broader child passenger safety program and train-the-trainer implications beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",Jim Max DeCarli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248679,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248679,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
99,A longitudinal study of the impact of human mobility on the incidence of COVID-19 in India,"Human mobility plays a crucial role in determining how fast and where infectious diseases can spread. This study aims to investigate visit to which category of places among grocery, retail, parks, workplaces, residential, and transit stations is more associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in India. A longitudinal analysis of generalized estimating equation (GEE) with a Poisson log-linear model is employed to analyze the daily mobility rate and reported new cases of COVID-19 between March 14 and September 11, 2020. This study finds that mobility to places of grocery (food and vegetable markets, drug stores etc.) and retail (restaurants, cafes, shopping centres etc.) is significantly associated (at p<0.01) with the incidence of COVID-19. In contrast, visits to parks, transit stations and mobility within residential neighbourhoods are not statistically significant (p>0.05) in changing COVID-19 cases over time. These findings highlight that instead of blanket lockdown restrictions, authorities should adopt a place-based approach focusing on vulnerable hotspot locations to contain the COVID-19 and any future infectious disease.",Sarbeswar Praharaj; Hoon Han,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248523,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248523,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
100,"Healthcare worker intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons for hesitancy: A survey of 16,158 health system employees on the eve of vaccine distribution","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited COVID-19 vaccines. They have also been identified as potential ambassadors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, helping to ensure that sufficient members of a hesitant public accept COVID-19 vaccines to achieve population immunity. Yet HCWs themselves have shown vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey (N = 16,158; response rate 61%) administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (n = 1155). Although only suggestive, this trend offers hope that rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be higher among HCWs and, perhaps, the general public than more hypothetical survey results have indicated.",Michelle N Meyer; Tamara Gjorgjieva; Daniel Rosica,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248555,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248555,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
101,"SARS-CoV-2 infections among personnel providing home care services for the elderly in Stockholm, Sweden","Background In March 2020, Stockholm, Sweden was hit by a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Four weeks later, a systematic study of testing for past or present infections among healthcare workers in the region was launched. Only a minority of COVID-19 related deaths occurred at hospitals and the study was therefore extended to employees in companies providing home care services for the elderly. Methods Five companies offered participation to 438 employees at work and 405 employees (92.5%) were enrolled. Serum samples were analyzed for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and throat swabs were tested by for the SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR. Results Among home care employees, 20.1% (81/403) were seropositive, about twice as many as in a simultaneously enrolled reference population (healthcare workers entirely without patient contact, n=3,671; 9.7% seropositivity). Only 13/379 employees (3.4%) had evidence of a current infection (PCR positivity). Among these, 5 were also seropositive (a sign of past infection or lingering infection after symptoms have resolved) and 3 were positive with only low amounts of virus. The combination of high amounts of virus and no antibodies, a characteristic for pre-symptomatic COVID-19, was thus present only in 5 employees (1.3%). Conclusions Personnel providing home service for the elderly appear to be a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Employees likely to be pre-symptomatic for COVID-19 can be readily identified by screening. Increased attention for protection of employees as well as of the elderly they serve is warranted.",Sadaf Sakina Hassan; Asa Seigerud; Laila Sara Arroyo Muhr; Sara Nordqvist-Kleppe; Elisa Pin; Anna Manberg; Sophia Hober; Peter Nilsson; Lars Engstrand; Miriam Elfstrom; Jonas Blomqvist; Kalle Conneryd-Lundgren; Joakim Dillner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248511,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248511,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
102,LungAI: A Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network for Automated Detection of COVID-19 from Posteroanterior Chest X-Rays,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of December 2020, more than 72 million cases have been reported worldwide. The standard method of diagnosis is by Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) from a Nasopharyngeal Swab. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Due to rate of spreading of the disease manual detection among people is becoming more difficult because of a clear lack of testing capability. Thus there was need of a quick and reliable yet non-labour intensive detection technique. Considering that the virus predominantly appears in the form of a lung based abnormality I made use of Chest X-Rays as our primary mode of detection. For this detection system we made use of Posteroanterior (PA) Chest X-rays of people infected with Bacterial Pneumonia (2780 Images), Viral Pneumonia (1493 Images), Covid-19 (729 Images) as well as those of perfectly Healthy Individuals (1583 Images) procured from various Publicly Available Datasets and Radiological Societies. LungAI is a novel Convolutional Neural Network based on a Hybrid of the DarkNet and AlexNet architecture. The network was trained on 80% of the dataset with 20% kept for validation. The proposed Coronavirus Detection Model performed exceedingly well with an accuracy of 99.16%, along with a Sensitivity value of 99.31% and Specificity value of 99.14%. Thus LungAI has the potential to prove useful in managing the current Pandemic Situation by providing a reliable and fast alternative to Coronavirus Detection given strong results.",Aryan Gulati,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248530,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248530,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
103,Home confinement during COVID-19 pandemic reduced physical activity but not health-related quality of life in previously active older women,"Background: To investigate the effect of COVID-19 home confinement on levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in older women previously participating in exercise and educational programs. Methods: 64 older women (age = 72{+/-}5 ys) who participated in a physical exercise/educational program and adhered to government home confinement recommendations have their levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior and HRQL assessed before and during (11 to 13 weeks after introduction of government recommendations to reduce virus transmission) COVID-19 pandemic. Results: There were significant reductions in total physical activity (-259 METs/week, P = 0.02), as a result of a ~17.0 % reduction in walking (-30.8 min/week, P = 0.004) and ~41.8 % reduction in vigorous-intensity activity (-29.6 min/week, P < 0.001). Sedentary behavior also increased (2.24 h/week, P < 0.001; 1.07 h/week days, P < 0.001; and 1.54 h/weekend days, P < 0.001). However, no significant change occurred in moderate-intensity physical activity, and HRQL domains and facets, except for an improvement in environment domain. Conclusion: Home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic decreased levels of physical activity and increased levels of sedentary behavior in previously active older women who participated in an educational program. However, there were no significant changes in HRQL. These results suggest that educational programs promoting healthy behaviors may attenuate the impact of home confinement in older women.",Vanessa Teixeira do Amaral; Isabela Roque Marcal; Thiago da Cruz Silva; Fernanda Bianchi Souza; Yacco Volpato Munhoz; Pedro Henrique Camprigher Witzler; Matheus Monge Soares Correa; Bianca Fernandes; Emmanuel Gomes Ciolac,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248662,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248662,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
104,When months matter; modelling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnostic pathway of Motor Neurone Disease (MND),"Background A diagnosis of MND takes an average 10-16 months from symptom onset. Early diagnosis is important to access supportive measures to maximise quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant delays in NHS pathways; the majority of GP appointments now occur online with subsequent delays in secondary care assessment. Given the rapid progression of MND, patients may be disproportionately affected resulting in late stage new presentations. We used Monte Carlo simulation to model the pre-COVID-19 diagnostic pathway and then introduced plausible COVID-19 delays. Methods The diagnostic pathway was modelled using gamma distributions of time taken: 1) from symptom onset to GP presentation, 2) for specialist referral, and 3) for diagnosis reached after neurology appointment. We incorporated branches to simulate delays: when patients did not attend their GP and when the GP consultation did not result in referral. An emergency presentation was triggered when diagnostic pathway time was within 30 days of projected median survival. Total time-to-diagnosis was calculated over 100,000 iterations. The pre-COVID-19 model was estimated using published data and the Improving MND Care Survey 2019. We estimated COVID-19 delays using published statistics. Results The pre-COVID model reproduced known features of the MND diagnostic pathway, with a median time to diagnosis of 399 days and predicting 5.2% of MND patients present as undiagnosed emergencies. COVID-19 resulted in diagnostic delays from 558 days when only primary care was 25% delayed, to 915 days when both primary and secondary care were 75%. The model predicted an increase in emergency presentations ranging from 15.4%-44.5%. Interpretations The model suggests the COVID-19 pandemic will result in later-stage diagnoses and more emergency presentations of undiagnosed MND. Late-stage presentations may require rapid escalation to multidisciplinary care. Proactive recognition of acute and late-stage disease with altered service provision will optimise care for people with MND.

105,Minimizing cumulative risk to control airborne transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in schools,"School classrooms, where students and teachers spend prolonged periods of time, are risky environments for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV2. While countries worldwide have been pursuing different school reopening strategies, most EU countries are planning to keep schools open during the whole winter season 2020/21. However, this poses a controversial technical issue: air ventilation of classrooms (an essential mitigation factor for airborne transmission) is expected to lower down sensibly due to colder outdoor temperatures. More specifically, personnel and students will ask for more window closure during winter lessons and regulators will probably allow less restrictive policies on windows closure. A fundamental question arise: to which extent can we contain airborne risk in schools during the cold season? What would be the best mitigation strategy considering also the risk for other seasonal diseases? To try answering these questions a theoretical framework has been developed, which shows the link between ventilation (natural or mechanical), time duration of ventilation intervals and the lowering of aerosol contagion risk. A safety zone and a theoretical optimum which minimizes the airborne risk by optimized air change intervals is presented. The role of mechanical ventilation in schools is also highlighted.",Alessandro Zivelonghi; Massimo Lai,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248493,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248493,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
106,Spatial Allocation of Scarce Vaccine and Antivirals for COVID-19,"Although the COVID-19 disease burden is heterogeneous across space, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends an equitable spatial allocation of pharmaceutical interventions based, for example, on population size, in the interest of speed and workability. Utilizing economic--epidemiological modeling, we benchmark the performance of ad hoc allocation rules of scarce vaccines and drugs by comparing them to the rules for a vaccine and for a drug treatment that minimize the economic damages and expenditures over time, including a penalty cost representing the social costs of deviating from an ad hoc allocation. Under different levels of vaccine and drug scarcity, we consider scenarios where length of immunity and compliance to travel restrictions vary, and consider the robustness of the rules when assumptions regarding these factors are incorrect. Because drugs and vaccines attack different points in the disease pathology, the benefits from deviating from the ad hoc rule differ. For drug treatment, optimal policies often allocate all available treatments to one jurisdiction for a period of time, while ad hoc rules act to spread out treatments across jurisdictions. For vaccines, the benefits from deviating are especially high when immunity is permanent, when there is compliance to travel restrictions, and when the supply of vaccine is low. Interestingly, a lack of compliance to travel restrictions pushes the optimal allocations of vaccine towards the ad hoc and improves the relative robustness of the ad hoc rules, as the mixing of the populations reduces the spatial heterogeneity in disease burden.",François M.

107,COVID-19 Risk Stratification and Mortality Prediction in Hospitalized Indian Patients,"The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is highly variable with the vast majority recovering uneventfully but a small fraction progressing to severe disease and death. Appropriate and timely supportive care can reduce mortality and it is critical to evolve better patient risk stratification based on simple clinical data, so as to perform effective triage during strains on the healthcare infrastructure. This study presents risk stratification and mortality prediction models based on usual clinical data from 544 COVID-19 patients from New Delhi, India using machine learning methods. A Random Forest classifier yielded the best performance on risk stratification (F1 score of 0.81). A logistic regression model yielded the best performance on mortality prediction (F1 score of 0.71). Significant biomarkers for predicting risk and mortality were identified. Examination of the data in comparison to a similar dataset with a Wuhan cohort of 375 patients was undertaken to understand the much lower mortality rates in India and the possible reasons thereof. The comparison indicated higher survival rate in the Delhi cohort even when patients had similar parameters as the Wuhan patients who died. Steroid administration was very frequent in Delhi patients, especially in surviving patients whose biomarkers indicated severe disease. This study helps in identifying the high-risk patient population and suggests treatment protocols that may be useful in countries with high mortality rates.",Shanmukh Alle; Samreen Siddiqui; Akshay Kanakan; Akshit Garg; Akshaya Karthikeyan; Neha Mishra; Swati Waghdhare; Akansha Tyagi; Bansidhar Tarai; Pranjal Pratim Hazarika; Poonam Das; Sandeep Budhiraja; Vivek Nangia; Arun Dewan; Ramanathan Sethuraman; C.

108,How do Covid-19 policy options depend on end-of-year holiday contacts in Mexico City Metropolitan Area? A Modeling Study,"Background: With more than 20 million residents, Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has the largest number of Covid-19 cases in Mexico and is at risk of exceeding its hospital capacity in late December 2020. Methods: We used SC-COSMO, a dynamic compartmental Covid-19 model, to evaluate scenarios considering combinations of increased contacts during the holiday season, intensification of social distancing, and school reopening. Model parameters were derived from primary data from MCMA, published literature, and calibrated to time-series of incident confirmed cases, deaths, and hospital occupancy. Outcomes included projected confirmed cases and deaths, hospital demand, and magnitude of hospital capacity exceedance. Findings: Following high levels of holiday contacts even with no in-person schooling, we predict that MCMA will have 1.0 million (95% prediction interval 0.5 - 1.7) additional Covid-19 cases between December 7, 2020 and March 7, 2021 and that hospitalizations will peak at 35,000 (14,700 - 67,500) on January 27, 2021, with a >99% chance of exceeding Covid-19-specific capacity (9,667 beds). If holiday contacts can be controlled, MCMA can reopen in-person schools provided social distancing is increased with 0.5 million (0.2 - 1.0) additional cases and hospitalizations peaking at 14,900 (5,600 - 32,000) on January 23, 2021 (77% chance of exceedance). Interpretation: MCMA must substantially increase Covid-19 hospital capacity under all scenarios considered. MCMA's ability to reopen schools in mid-January 2021 depends on sustaining social distancing and that contacts during the end-of-year holiday were well controlled.",Fernando Alarid-Escudero; Valeria Gracia; Andrea Luviano; Yadira Peralta; Marissa B.

The assays were conducted with 184 samples in three panels collected from 134 patients. Panel 1 and 2 consist of RT-PCR positive samples collected within two weeks and after two weeks of symptom onset, respectively. Negative samples are included in panel 3 from healthy donors and pre-pandemic dengue patients. The total assay time has been set 30 minutes for both of the ELISA assays. Results show that S1 and RBD ELISA demonstrates 73.68% and 84.21% sensitivities, respectively for samples collected within two weeks, whereas 100% sensitivities were achieved by both for samples that were collected after two weeks of the onset of symptoms. S1-ELISA shows 0% positivity to panel 3 while for RBD-ELISA the figure is 1%. A strong correlation (rs=0.804, p<0.0001)) has been observed between these two assays. When compared with NCP-ELISA, S1 slightly better correlation (rs=0.800, p<0.0001) than RBD (rs=0.740, p<0.0001). Our study suggests S1-ELISA as more sensitive one than the RBD or nucleocapsid ELISA during the later phase of infection, while for overall sero-monitoring RBD specific IgG ELISA is recommended. Moreover, non-reactivity to dengue emphasize the use of these assays for serosurveillance of COVID-19 in the dengue endemic regions.",Bijon Kumar Sil; Nihad Adnan; Mumtarin Jannat Oishee; Tamanna Ali; Nowshin Jahan; Shahad Saif Khandker; Eiry Kobatake; Masayasu Mie; Dr. Mohib Ullah Khondoker; Md.

110,Immunogenicity and crossreactivity of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein,"COVID-19 patients elicit strong responses to the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 but binding antibodies are also detected in prepandemic individuals, indicating potential crossreactivity with common cold human coronaviruses (HCoV) and questioning its utility in seroprevalence studies. We investigated the immunogenicity of the full-length and shorter fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and the crossreactivity of antibodies with HCoV. We indentified a C-terminus region in SARS-CoV2 N of minimal sequence homology with HCoV that was more specific and highly immunogenic. IgGs to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 N also recognised N229E N, and IgGs to HKU1 N recognised SARS-CoV-2 N. Crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2 was stronger for alpha- rather than beta-HCoV despite having less sequence identity, revealing the importance of conformational recognition. Higher preexisting IgG to OC43 N correlated with lower IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in rRT-PCR negative individuals, reflecting less exposure and indicating a potential protective association. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N were higher in patients with more severe and longer symptoms and in females. IgGs remained stable for at least 3 months, while IgAs and IgMs declined faster. In conclusion, N is a primary target of SARS-CoV-2-specific and HCoV crossreactive antibodies, both of which may affect the acquisition of immunity to COVID-19.",Carlota Dobano; Rebeca Santano; Alfons Jimenez; Marta Vidal; Jordi Chi; Natalia Rodrigo Melero; Matija Popovic; Ruben Lopez-Aladid; Laia Fernandez-Barat; Marta Tortajada; Francisco Carmona-Torre; Gabriel Reina; Antoni Torres; Alfredo Mayor; Carlo Carolis; Alberto L Garcia-Basteiro; Ruth Aguilar; Gemma Moncunill; Luis Izquierdo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248551,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248551,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
111,Predicting intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among the general population using the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior Model,"Background: A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March, 2020. Until such time as a vaccine becomes available, it is important to identify the determining factors that influence the intention of the general public to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine. Consequently, we aim to explore behavioral-related factors predicting intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among the general population using the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model. Methods: An online survey was conducted among adults aged 18 years and older from May 24 to June 24, 2020. The survey included socio-demographic and health-related questions, questions related to the HBM and TPB dimensions, and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Associations between questionnaire variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Eighty percent of 398 eligible respondents stated their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A unified model including HBM and TPB covariates as well as demographic and health-related factors, proved to be a powerful predictor of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine, explaining 78% of the variance (adjusted R2 = 0.78). Men (OR=4.35, 95% CI 1.58-11.93), educated respondents (OR=3.54, 95% CI 1.44-8.67) and respondents who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the previous year (OR=3.31, 95% CI 1.22-9.00) stated higher intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccine (OR=4.49, 95% CI 2.79-7.22), of perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (OR=2.36, 95% CI 1.58-3.51) and of cues to action (OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.38-2.87), according to HBM, and if they reported higher levels of subjective norms (OR=3.04, 95% CI 2.15-4.30) and self-efficacy (OR=2.05, 95% CI 1.54-2.72) according to TPB. Although half of the respondents reported they had not received influenza vaccine last year, 40% of them intended to receive influenza vaccine in the coming winter and 66% of them intended to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: Providing data on the public perspective and predicting intention for COVID-19 vaccination using HBM and TPB is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers and can help better guide compliance as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to the public.",Liora Shmueli,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248587,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248587,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
112,Changes in UK hospital mortality in the first wave of COVID-19: the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol prospective multicentre observational cohort study,"Background Mortality rates of UK patients hospitalised with COVID-19 appeared to fall during the first wave. We quantify potential drivers of this change and identify groups of patients who remain at high risk of dying in hospital. Methods The International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK recruited a prospective cohort admitted to 247 acute UK hospitals with COVID-19 in the first wave (March to August 2020). Outcome was hospital mortality within 28 days of admission. We performed a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and hospital mortality adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidity, illness severity) and quantifying potential mediators (respiratory support and steroids). Findings Unadjusted hospital mortality fell from 32.3% (95%CI 31.8, 32.7) in March/April to 16.4% (95%CI 15.0, 17.8) in June/July 2020. Reductions were seen in all ages, ethnicities, both sexes, and in comorbid and non-comorbid patients. After adjustment, there was a 19% reduction in the odds of mortality per 4 week period (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.79, 0.83). 15.2% of this reduction was explained by greater disease severity and comorbidity earlier in the epidemic. The use of respiratory support changed with greater use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). 22.2% (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.94, 0.96) of the reduction in mortality was mediated by changes in respiratory support. Interpretation The fall in hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients during the first wave in the UK was partly accounted for by changes in case mix and illness severity. A significant reduction was associated with differences in respiratory support and critical care use, which may partly reflect improved clinical decision making. The remaining improvement in mortality is not explained by these factors, and may relate to community behaviour on inoculum dose and hospital capacity strain.

113,"Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant tandem-repeat dimeric RBD protein vaccine against COVID-19 in adults: pooled analysis of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials","Background A safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic. Although progress has been made recently with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study. Methods We did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive three doses of vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 g or 50 g RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085. Findings Between June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2 study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants receiving either 25 g or 50 g dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25 g group) and 93% (the 50 g group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study. The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 g group and 117.8 for the 50 g group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 g group and 69.1 for the 50 g group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent samples (GMT, 51). Vaccine induced balanced TH1 and TH2 responses. The 50 g group did not show enhanced immunogenicity compared with the 25 g group. Interpretation The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 is well-tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from phase 1 and 2 trials for ZF2001 support the use of 25 g vaccine dose with three-dose schedule to an ongoing phase 3 large-scale evaluation for safety and efficacy.

114,COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in South Africa: the intersection of communicable and non-communicable chronic diseases in a high HIV prevalence setting,"Background: The interaction between COVID-19, non-communicable diseases, and chronic infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are unclear, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Africa. We investigated this interaction using a nationally representative hospital surveillance system in South Africa. Methods: A national surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions (DATCOV) was established. Using DATCOV data, we describe the demographic characteristics, clinical features, and in-hospital mortality among individuals admitted to public and private hospitals with COVID-19 during 5 March to 11 August 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare individuals who were HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected and determine the factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Findings: Hospital admissions peaked at 1,560 admissions per day, in late July. Among the 41,877 individuals admitted with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 7,662 (18.3%) died. Comorbidities were documented in 27,555 (65.8%) individuals, most commonly observed were hypertension (36.8%), diabetes (29.6%), obesity (19.7%), and HIV (8.7%); TB was reported in 0.7% of individuals. Increased risk of in-hospital mortality was associated with HIV and TB, as well as other described risk factors for COVID-19, such as increasing age, male sex, non-White race (Black, mixed and Indian race), chronic underlying conditions particularly hypertension, diabetes and obesity. In addition, HIV-infected individuals with immunosuppression had increased risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-3.1). Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes was 39.9%. The effect of multiple comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals. Interpretation: These data provide a better understanding of the interaction of non-communicable diseases, chronic infectious diseases like HIV and TB and COVID-19. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying comorbidities (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals. HIV- and TB-infected individuals, particularly those with additional comorbidities, would benefit from COVID-19 prevention and treatment programmes.",WAASILA JASSAT; Cheryl Cohen; Maureen Masha; Susan Goldstein; Tendesayi Kufa-Chakezha; Dana Savulescu; Sibongile Walaza; Jamy-Lee Bam; Mary-Ann Davies; Hans W Prozesky; Jonathan Naude; Trevor Mnguni; Charlene A Lawrence; Hlengani Mathema; Lucille Blumberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248409,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248409,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
115,Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations in acutely ill patients,"Dysregulated immune profiles have been described in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Whether the reported immune alterations are specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection or also triggered by other acute illnesses remains unclear. We performed flow cytometry analysis on fresh peripheral blood from a consecutive cohort of i) patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; ii) patients of comparable age/sex hospitalized for other acute disease (SARS-CoV-2 negative); and iii) healthy controls. Using both data-driven and hypothesis-driven analyses, we found several dysregulations in immune cell subsets (e.g. decreased proportion of T cells) that are similarly associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and non-COVID-19 related acute illnesses. In contrast, we identified specific differences in myeloid and lymphocyte subsets that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 status (e.g. elevated proportion of ICAM-1+ mature/activated neutrophils, ALCAM+ monocytes, and CD38+CD8+ T cells). A subset of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations correlated with disease severity, disease outcome at 30 days and mortality. Our data provides novel understanding of the immune dysregulation that are specifically associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among acute care hospitalized patients. Our study lays the foundation for the development of specific biomarkers to stratify SARS-CoV-2+ patients at risk of unfavorable outcome and uncover novel candidate molecules to investigate from a therapeutic perspective.",Rose-Marie Rebillard; Marc Charabati; Camille Grasmuck; Abdelali Filali-Mouhim; Olivier Tastet; Nathalie Brassard; Audrey Daigneault; Lyne Bourbonniere; Renaud Balthazard; Ana Carmena Moratalla; Yves Carpentier Solorio; Negar Farzam-kia; Antoine Philippe Fournier; Elizabeth Gowing; Helene Jamann; Florent Lemaitre; Victoria Hannah Mamane; Karine Thai; Jean-Franois Cailhier; Nicolas Chomont; Andres Finzi; Michael Chasse; Madeleine Durand; Nathalie Arbour; Daniel E Kaufmann; Alexandre Prat; Catherine Larochelle,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248642,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248642,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
116,"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies; longevity, breadth, and evasion by emerging viral variants","The SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization response and its evasion by emerging viral variants are unknown. Antibody immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens and Spike variants, inhibition of Spike-driven virus-cell fusion, and infectious SARS-CoV-2 neutralization were characterized in 807 serial samples from 233 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 individuals with detailed demographics and followed up to seven months. A broad and sustained polyantigenic immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid proteins, along with high viral neutralization were associated with COVID-19 severity. A subgroup of high responders maintained high neutralizing responses over time, representing ideal convalescent plasma therapy donors. Antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 during the first COVID-19 wave had reduced immunoreactivity and neutralization potency to emerging Spike variants.

117,Clinical outcomes and risk factors for COVID-19 among migrant populations in high-income countries: a systematic review,"Background Migrants, including refugees, asylum seekers, labour migrants, and undocumented migrants, now constitute a considerable proportion of most high-income countries' populations, including their skilled and unskilled workforces. Migrants may be at increased risk of COVID-19 due to their health and social circumstances, yet the extent to which they are being affected and their predisposing risk factors are not clearly understood. We did a systematic review to assess clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in migrant populations (cases, hospitalisations, deaths), indirect health and social impacts, and to determine key risk factors. Methods We did a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222135). We searched databases including PubMed, Global Health, Scopus, CINAHL, and pre-print databases (medRxiv) via the WHO Global Research on COVID-19 database to Nov 18, 2020 for peer-reviewed and grey literature pertaining to migrants (defined as foreign born) and COVID-19 in 82 high-income countries. We used our international networks to source national datasets and grey literature. Data were extracted on our primary outcomes (cases, hospitalisations, deaths) and we evaluated secondary outcomes on indirect health and social impacts, and risk factors, using narrative synthesis. Results 3016 data sources were screened with 158 from 15 countries included in the analysis (35 data sources for primary outcomes: cases [21], hospitalisations [4]; deaths [15]; 123 for secondary outcomes). We found that migrants are at increased risk of infection and are disproportionately represented among COVID-19 cases. Available datasets suggest a similarly disproportionate representation of migrants in reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as increased all-cause mortality in migrants in some countries in 2020. Undocumented migrants, migrant health and care workers, and migrants housed in camps and labour compounds may have been especially affected. In general, migrants have higher levels of many risk factors and vulnerabilities relevant to COVID-19, including increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to high-risk occupations and overcrowded accommodation, and barriers to health care including inadequate information, language barriers, and reduced entitlement to healthcare coverage related to their immigration status. Conclusions Migrants in high-income countries are at high risk of exposure to, and infection with, COVID-19. These data are of immediate relevance to national public health responses to the pandemic and should inform policymaking on strategies for reducing transmission of COVID-19 in this population. Robust data on testing uptake and clinical outcomes in migrants, and barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination, are urgently needed, alongside strengthening engagement with diverse migrant groups.",Sally E Hayward; Anna Deal; Cherie Cheng; Alison F Crawshaw; Miriam Orcutt; Tushna F Vandrevala; Marrie Norredam; Manuel Carballo; Yusuf Ciftci; Ana Requena-Mendez; Chris Greenaway; Jessica Carter; Felicity Knights; Anushka Mehrotra; Farah Seedat; Kayvan Bozorgmehr; Apostolos Veizis; Ines Campos-Matos; Fatima Wurie; Teymur Noori; Martin McKee; Bernadette Kumar; Sally Hargreaves,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248475,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248475,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
118,The first wave of the Spanish COVID-19 epidemic was associated with early introductions and fast spread of a dominating genetic variant,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world since the beginning of 2020. Spain is among the European countries with the highest incidence of the disease during the first pandemic wave. We established a multidisciplinar consortium to monitor and study the evolution of the epidemic, with the aim of contributing to decision making and stopping rapid spreading across the country. We present the results for 2170 sequences from the first wave of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic in Spain and representing 12% of diagnosed cases until 14th March. This effort allows us to document at least 500 initial introductions, between early February-March from multiple international sources. Importantly, we document the early raise of two dominant genetic variants in Spain (Spanish Epidemic Clades), named SEC7 and SEC8, likely amplified by superspreading events. In sharp contrast to other non-Asian countries those two variants were closely related to the initial variants of SARS-CoV-2 described in Asia and represented 40% of the genome sequences analyzed. The two dominant SECs were widely spread across the country compared to other genetic variants with SEC8 reaching a 60% prevalence just before the lockdown. Employing Bayesian phylodynamic analysis, we inferred a reduction in the effective reproductive number of these two SECs from around 2.5 to below 0.5 after the implementation of strict public-health interventions in mid March. The effects of lockdown on the genetic variants of the virus are reflected in the general replacement of preexisting SECs by a new variant at the beginning of the summer season. Our results reveal a significant difference in the genetic makeup of the epidemic in Spain and support the effectiveness of lockdown measures in controlling virus spread even for the most successful genetic variants. Finally, earlier control of SEC7 and particularly SEC8 might have reduced the incidence and impact of COVID-19 in our country.",Mariana G.

119,From SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19 disease: a proposed mechanism for viral spread to the lower airway based on in silico estimation of virion flow rates,"While the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory airway is the dominant initial infection site for SARS-CoV-2, the physiologic mechanism that launches the infection in the lower airway is still not well-understood. Based on the rapidity with which SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses to the lungs, it has been conjectured that the nasopharynx acts as the seeding zone for subsequent contamination of the lower airway via aspiration of virus-laden boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids. In this study, we examine the plausibility of this proposed mechanism. To this end, we have developed computational fluid mechanics models of the inhalation process in two medical imaging based airway reconstructions and have quantified the nasopharyngeal liquid volume ingested into the lower airspace during each aspiration. The numerical predictions are validated by comparing the number of projected aspirations (approximately 2 - 4) during an eight-hour sleep cycle with prior observational findings of 3 aspirations in human subjects. Extending the numerical trends on aspiration volume to earlier records on aspiration frequency for the entire day indicates a total aspirated nasopharyngeal liquid volume of 0.3 - 0.76 ml per day. We then used sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients to estimate the number of virions that are transmitted daily to the lungs via nasopharyngeal liquid boluses. For mean sputum viral load, our modeling projects that the number of virions penetrating to the lower airway per day will range over 2.1(10^6) - 5.3(10^6); for peak viral load, the corresponding number of penetrating virions hovers between 7.1(10^8) - 17.9(10^8). These findings fill in a key piece of the mechanistic puzzle of the progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nasopharynx to the development of COVID-19 disease within a patient, and point to dysphagia as a potential underlying risk factor for COVID-19. The findings also have significant practical implications in the design of COVID-19 prophylactics and therapeutics that aim to constrain the pathogenic progress of the disease within the limits of the upper airway.",Saikat Basu; Arijit Chakravarty,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248544,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248544,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
120,A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis for COVID-19 Treatments,"Background: Numerous interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been investigated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy of available treatments for COVID-19. Methods: We searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database, PubMed, PubMed Central, LitCovid, Proquest Central and Ovid up to December 19, 2020. RCTs for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, regardless of publication status or demographic characteristics. Bayesian NMA with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs), while that with random effects was carried out as well for sensitivity analysis. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect sizes of treatments grouped by their drug classifications. Results: We identified 96 eligible RCTs with a total of 51187 patients. Compared with the standard of care (SOC), this NMA showed that dexamethasone led to lower risk of mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 (95% CrI [0.76, 0.95]; moderate certainty) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (MV) with an OR of 0.68 (95% CrI [0.56, 0.83]; low certainty). For hospital discharge, remdesivir (OR 1.37, 95% CrI [1.15, 1.64]; moderate certainty), dexamethasone (OR 1.20, 95% CrI [1.08, 1.34]; low certainty), interferon beta (OR 2.15, 95% CrI [1.26, 3.74]; moderate certainty), tocilizumab (OR 1.40, 95% CrI [1.05, 1.89]; moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (OR 1.75, 95% CrI [1.28, 2.39]; moderate certainty) could all increase the discharge rate respectively. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor indicated lower risk of MV (OR 0.20, 95% CrI [0.10, 0.40]; moderate certainty); and patients receiving convalescent plasma resulted in better viral clearance (OR 2.28, 95% CrI [1.57, 3.34]; low certainty). About two-thirds of the studies included in this NMA were rated as high risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was either low or very low for most of the comparisons. Conclusion: The Bayesian NMA identified superiority of several COVID-19 treatments over SOC in terms of mortality, requirement of MV, hospital discharge and viral clearance. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of current COVID-19 treatments and shed new light on further research and discovery of potential COVID-19 treatments.",Chenyang Zhang; Huaqing Jin; Yifeng Wen; Guosheng Yin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248621,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248621,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
121,Comparative analysis of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assays for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions worldwide and there is an urgent need to increase our diagnostic capacity to identify infected cases. Although RT-qPCR remains the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection, this method requires specialised equipment in a diagnostic laboratory and has a long turn-around time to process the samples. To address this, several groups have recently reported development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a simple, low cost and rapid method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Herein we present a comparative analysis of three LAMP-based assays that target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2: ORF1ab RdRP, ORF1ab nsp3 and Gene N. We perform a detailed assessment of their sensitivity, kinetics and false positive rates for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in LAMP or RT-LAMP reactions, using colorimetric or fluorescent detection. Our results independently validate that all three assays can detect SARS-CoV-2 in 30 minutes, with robust accuracy at detecting as little as 1000 RNA copies and the results can be visualised simply by color changes. We also note the shortcomings of these LAMP-based assays, including variable results with shorter reaction time or lower load of SARS-CoV-2, and false positive results in some experimental conditions. Overall for RT-LAMP detection, the ORF1ab RdRP and ORF1ab nsp3 assays have higher sensitivity and faster kinetics for detection, whereas the Gene N assay exhibits no false positives in 30 minutes reaction time. This study provides validation of the performance of LAMP-based assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which have important implications in development of point-of-care diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2.",Daniel Urrutia-Cabrera; Roxanne Hsiang-Chi Liou; Jianxiong Chan; Sandy Shen-Chi Hung; Alex W Hewitt; Keith Martin; Patrick Kwan; Raymond Ching-Bong Wong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248288,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248288,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

123,SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia predicts clinical deterioration and extrapulmonary complications from COVID-19.,"Background The determinants of COVID-19 disease severity and extrapulmonary complications (EPCs) are poorly understood. We characterise the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia and disease severity, clinical deterioration, and specific EPCs. Methods We used quantitative (qPCR) and digital (dPCR) PCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma in 191 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COVID-19. We recorded patient symptoms, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes, with a focus on oxygen requirements over time. We collected longitudinal plasma samples from a subset of patients. We characterised the role of RNAaemia in predicting clinical severity and EPCs using elastic net regression. Findings 23.0% (44/191) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had viral RNA detected in plasma by dPCR, compared to 1.4% (2/147) by qPCR. Most patients with serial measurements had undetectable RNAaemia 10 days after onset of symptoms, but took 16 days to reach maximum severity, and 33 days for symptoms to resolve. Initially RNAaemic patients were more likely to manifest severe disease (OR 6.72 [95% CI, 2.45-19.79]), worsening of disease severity (OR 2.43 [95% CI, 1.07-5.38]), and EPCs (OR 2.81 [95% CI, 1.26-6.36]). RNA load correlated with maximum severity (r = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.20-0.67]). Interpretation dPCR is more sensitive than qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, which is a robust predictor of eventual COVID-19 severity and oxygen requirements, as well as EPCs. Since many COVID-19 therapies are initiated on the basis of oxygen requirements, RNAaemia on presentation might serve to direct early initiation of appropriate therapies for the patients most likely to deteriorate.",Nikhil Ram-Mohan; David Kim; Elizabeth J Zudock; Marjan M Hashemi; Kristel C Tjandra; Angela J Rogers; Catherine A Blish; Kari C Nadeau; Jennifer A Newberry; James V Quinn; Ruth O'Hara; Euan Ashley; Hien Nguyen; Lingxia Jiang; Paul Hung; - the Stanford COVID-19 Biobank Study Group; Andra L Blomkalns; Samuel Yang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248561,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248561,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True

125,Clustering and longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in school-children: prospective cohort study of 55 schools in Switzerland,"Background and aims: The facilitating role of the school setting in SARS-CoV-2 infection spread is still debated and the potential of school closures to mitigate transmission unclear. In autumn 2020, Switzerland experienced one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe while keeping schools open, thus offering a high-exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal change in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and the evolution of clustering within classes and schools from June to November, 2020, in a prospective cohort study of school children in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Methods: Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited to participate in serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020. Parents of children filled questionnaires on sociodemographic and health-related questions. 55 schools and 275 classes within them were enrolled, with 2603 children participating in the first, and 2552 in the second testing (age range 6-16 years). We evaluated longitudinal changes of seroprevalence in districts and investigated clustering of seropositive cases within classes and schools. Results: Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CrI 1.4%-3.6%) in summer and 4.5% (95% CrI 3.2%-6.0%) in not previously seropositive children in late autumn, leading to estimated 7.8% (95% CrI 6.2%-9.5%) of ever seropositive children, without significant differences among lower, middle and upper school levels. Among the 2223 children with serology tested twice, 28 (40%) of previously positive were negative, and 109 (5%) previously negative became seropositive. Seroprevalence was not different between school levels or sexes, but varied across districts (1.7% to 15.0%). Between June-July and October-November 2020, the ratio of diagnosed to newly seropositive children was 1 to 8. At least one newly seropositive child was detected in 47 of 55 schools and 125 of 275 classes. Among the classes with at least 50% and [&ge;]5 children tested, 0, 1-2 or >=3 seropositive children were present in in 90 (58%), 57 (37%) and 7 (5%) out of 154 classes, respectively. Class level explained slightly more variation of individual serological results (standard deviation (SD) 0.97) than school level (SD 0.61) in the multilevel logistic regression models. Symptoms were reported for 22% of seronegative and 29% of newly seropositive children since summer. Conclusions: Under a regimen of open schools with some preventive measures in place since August, clustering of seropositive cases occurred in very few classes and not across entire schools despite a clear increase in seropositive children during a period of high transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Agne Ulyte; Thomas Radtke; Irene A Abela; Sarah R Haile; Christoph Berger; Michael Huber; Merle Schanz; Magdalena Schwarzmueller; Alexandra Trkola; Jan Fehr; Milo A.

126,A longitudinal seroprevalence study in a large cohort of working adults reveals that neutralising SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies persist for at least six months independent of the severity of symptoms,"Background In spring 2020, at the beginning of the first pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wave in Europe, we set up an assay system for large-scale testing of virus-specific and protective antibodies including their longevity. Methods We analysed the sera of 1655 adult employees for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Sera containing S1-reactive antibodies were further evaluated for receptor-binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific antibodies in relation to the neutralisation test (NT) results at 0, three and six months. Findings We found immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA antibodies reactive to the S1 protein in 10.15% (n=168) of the participants. In total, 0.97% (n=16) were positive for S1-IgG, 0.91% (n=15) were S1-IgG- borderline and 8.28% (n=137) exhibited only S1-IgA antibodies. Next, we evaluated the 168 S1-reactive sera for RBD- and NCP specificity: 8.33% (n=14) had detectable RBD-specific and 6.55% (n=11) NCP-specific antibodies. The latter correlated with NTs (kappa coefficient = 0.8660) but started to decline already after 3 months. RBD-specific antibodies correlated best with the NT (kappa = 0.9448) and only these antibodies were stable for up to six months. All participants with virus-neutralising antibodies reported symptoms, of which, anosmia and/or dysgeusia correlated best with the detection of virus-neutralising antibodies. Interpretation RBD-specific antibodies were most reliably detected post infection, independent of the number/severity of symptoms, and correlated best with protective neutralising antibodies at least for six months. They thus qualify best for large-scale seroepidemiological evaluation of both seroprevalence and seroprotection.",Angelika Wagner; Angela Guzek; Johanna Ruff; Joanna Jasinska; Ute Scheikl; Ines Zwazl; Michael Kundi; Hannes Stockinger; Maria R.

127,Several forms of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in wastewaters : implication for wastewater-based epidemiology and risk assessment.,"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a public health emergency of international concern. Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be mainly transmitted by inhalation of contaminated droplets and aerosols, SARS-CoV-2 is also detected in human feces and in raw wastewaters suggesting that other routes of infection may exist. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters has been proposed as a complementary approach for tracing the dynamics of virus transmission within human population connected to wastewater network. The understanding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission through wastewater surveillance, the development of epidemic modeling and the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from contaminated wastewater are largely limited by our knowledge on viral RNA genome persistence and virus infectivity preservation in such an environment. Using an integrity based RT-qPCR assay this study led to the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can persist under several forms in wastewaters, which provides important information on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewaters and associated risk assessment.",Sebastien Wurtzer; Prunelle Waldman; Audrey Ferrier-Rembert; Gaelle Frenois-Veyrat; Jean-Marie Mouchel; Mickael Boni; Yvon Maday; Consortium Obepine; Vincent Marechal; Laurent Moulin,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248508,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.20248508,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
128,Social disparities in the first wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany: A county-scale explainable machine learning approach,"Background Little is known about factors correlated with this geographic spread of the first wave of Covid-19 infections in Germany. Given the lack of individual-level socioeconomic information on COVID-19 cases, we resorted to an ecological study design, exploring regional correlates of COVID-19 diagnoses. Data and Method We used data from the Robert-Koch-Institute on COVID-19 diagnoses by sex, age (age groups: 0-4, 5-14, 15-34, 35-59, 60-79, 80+), county (NUTS3 region) differentiating five periods (initial phase: through 15 March; 1st lockdown period: 16 March to 31 March; 2nd lockdown period: from 1 April to 15 April; easing period: 16 April to 30 April; post-lockdown period: 1 May through 23 July). For each period we calculated age-standardized incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses on the county level, using the German age distribution from the year 2018. We characterized the regions by macro variables in nine domains: ""Demography"", ""Employment"", ""Politics, religion, and education"", ""Income"", ""Settlement structure and environment"", ""Health care"", ""(structural) Poverty"", ""Interrelationship with other regions"", and ""Geography"". We trained gradient boosting models to predict the age-standardized incidence rates with the macro structures of the counties, and used SHAP values to characterize the 20 most prominent features in terms of negative/positive correlations with the outcome variable. Results The change in the age-standardized incidence rates over time is reflected in the changing importance of features as indicated by the mean SHAP values for the five periods. The first Covid-19 wave started as a disease in wealthy rural counties in southern Germany, and ventured into poorer urban and agricultural counties during the course of the first wave. The negative social gradient became more pronounced from the 2nd lockdown period onwards, when wealthy counties appeared to be better protected. Population density per se does not appear to be a risk factor, and only in the post-lockdown period did connectedness become an important regional characteristic correlated with higher infections. Features related to economic and educational characteristics of the young population in a county played an important role at the beginning of the pandemic up to the 2nd lockdown phase, as did features related to the population living in nursing homes; those related to international migration and a large proportion of foreigners living in a county became important in the post-lockdown period. Discussion In the absence of individual level data, explainable machine learning methods based on regional data may help to better understand the changing nature of the drivers of the pandemic. High mobility of high SES groups may drive the pandemic at the beginning of waves, while mitigation measures and beliefs about the seriousness of the pandemic as well as the compliance with mitigation measures put lower SES groups at higher risks later on.",Gabriele Doblhammer; Constantin Reinke; Daniel Kreft,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248386,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.20248386,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
129,"Prioritizing Risk Groups for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination ""By the Numbers""","Background Given the limited supply of two COVID-19 vaccines, it will be important to choose which risk groups to prioritize for vaccination in order to get the most health benefits from that supply. Method In order to help decide how to get the maximum health yield from this limited supply, we implemented a logistic regression model to predict COVID-19 death risk by age, race and sex and did the same to predict COVID-19 case risk. Results Our predictive model ranked all demographic groups by COVID-19 death risk. It was highly concentrated by demographic group, e.g. 85+ year old Black, Non-Hispanic patients suffered 2,160 deaths per 100,000. The comparable risks did not reach the level of our 43 highest risk demographic groups (92% of all COVID 19 deaths), the risks of nursing home resident exceeded them at 5,200 deaths/100,000. We saw minimal concentration of COVID-19 case risk by demographic groups compared to the high concentration of COVID-19 death risk we saw among demographic groups. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 vaccines protect against severe COVID infection and thus against COVID-19 death per vaccine studies. Allocating at least some of the early vaccine supplies to high risk demographic groups could maximize lives saved. Our model predicts that allocating only 12 million vaccine courses to the 17 demographic groups at highest COVID-19 death risk (table 3 row 1-17 in our report) could eliminate 47% of COVID deaths with by investing only 3.7% the vaccine courses needed to protect all US residents -- a highly leveraged payoff.",Clement J McDonald; Seo Hyon Baik; Zhaonian Zheng; Liz Amos,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248504,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248504,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
130,A DNA INTERCALATING DYE-BASED RT-QPCR ALTERNATIVE TO DIAGNOSE SARS-COV-2,"Early detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been proven crucial during the efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several diagnostic methods have emerged in the past few months, each with different shortcomings and limitations. The current gold standard, RT-qPCR using fluorescent probes, relies on demanding equipment requirements plus the high costs of the probes and specific reaction mixes. To broaden the possibilities of reagents and thermocyclers that could be allocated towards this task, we have optimized an alternative strategy for RT-qPCR diagnosis. This is based on a widely used DNA-intercalating dye and can be implemented with several different qPCR reagents and instruments. Remarkably, the proposed qPCR method performs similarly to the broadly used TaqMan-based detection, in terms of specificity and sensitivity, thus representing a reliable tool. We think that, through enabling the use of vast range of thermocycler models and laboratory facilities for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, the alternative proposed here can increase dramatically the testing capability, especially in countries with limited access to costly technology and reagents.",Federico Fuchs Wightman; Micaela Godoy Herz; Juan Cristobal Munoz; Jose Nicolas Stigliano; Laureano Bragado; Nicolas Nieto Moreno; Marcos Palavecino; Lucas Servi; Gonzalo Cabrerizo; Jose Clemente; Martin Avaro; Andrea Pontoriero; Estefania Benedetti; Elsa Baumeister; Fabian Rudolf; Federico Remes Lenicov; - COVID-19-INBIRS working group; Cybele Garcia; Valeria Buggiano; Alberto R.

131,A Working Model to Inform Risk-Based Back to Work Strategies,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many businesses to close or move to remote work to reduce the potential spread of disease. Employers desiring a return to onsite work want to understand their risk for having an infected employee on site and how best to mitigate this risk. Here, we modelled a range of key metrics to help inform return to work policies and procedures, including evaluating the benefit and optimal design of a SARS-CoV-2 employee screening program. Methods: We modeled a range of input variables including prevalence of COVID-19, time infected, number of employees, test sensitivity and specificity, test turnaround time, number of times tested within the infectious period, and sample pooling. We modeled the impact of these input variables on several output variables: number of healthy employees; number of infected employees; number of test positive and test negative employees; number of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative employees; positive and negative predictive values; and time an infected, potentially contagious employee is on site. Results: We show that an employee screening program can reduce the risk for onsite transmission across different prevalence values and group sizes. For example, at a pre-test asymptomatic community prevalence of 0.5% (5 in 1000) with an employee group size of 500, the risk for at least one infected employee on site is 91.8%, with 3 asymptomatic infected employees predicted within those 500 employees. Implementing a SARS-CoV-2 baseline screen with an 80% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity would reduce the risk of at least one infected employee on site to 39.4% and the predicted number of infected employees onsite (false negatives) to 1. Repetitive testing is required for ongoing vigilance of onsite employees. The expected number of days an infected employee is on site depends on test sensitivity, testing interval, and turnaround time. If the test interval is longer than the infectious period (~14 days for COVID-19), testing will not detect the infected employee. Sample pooling reduces the number of tests performed, thereby reducing testing costs. However, the pooling methodology (eg, 1-stage vs 2-stage pooling, pool size) will impact the number of employees that screen positive, thereby affected the number of employees eligible to return to onsite work. Conclusions: The modeling presented here can be used to help employers understand their risk for having an infected employee on site. Further, it details how an employee screening program can reduce this risk and shows how screening performance and frequency impact the effectiveness of a screening program. The primary factors determining the effectiveness of a screening program are test sensitivity and frequency of testing.",Kristen Meier; Kirsten J.

132,Development and external validation of a logistic regression derived formula based on repeated routine hematological measurements predicting survival of hospitalized Covid-19 patients,"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has become a global public health crisis and providing optimal patient care while preventing a collapse of the health care system is a principal objective worldwide. Objective: To develop and validate a prognostic model based on routine hematological parameters to predict uncomplicated disease progression to support the decision for an earlier discharge. Design: Development and refinement of a multivariable logistic regression model with subsequent external validation. The time course of several hematological variables until four days after admission were used as predictors. Variables were first selected based on subject matter knowledge; their number was further reduced using likelihood ratio-based backward elimination in random bootstrap samples. Setting: Model development based on three Austrian hospitals, validation cohorts from two Austrian and one Swedish hospital. Participants: Model development based on 363 survivors and 78 non-survivors of Covid-19 hospitalized in Austria. External validation based on 492 survivors and 61 non-survivors hospitalized in Austria and Sweden. Outcome: In-hospital death. Main Results: The final model includes age, fever upon admission, parameters derived from C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, platelet count and creatinine concentration, approximating their baseline values (CRP, creatinine) and change over time (CRP, platelet count). In Austrian validation cohorts both discrimination and calibration of this model were good, with c indices of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 - 0.96) in a cohort from Vienna and 0.93 (0.88 - 0.98) in one from Linz. The model performance seems independent of how long symptoms persisted before admission. In a small Swedish validation cohort, the model performance was poorer (p = 0.008) compared with Austrian cohorts with a c index of 0.77 (0.67 - 0.88), potentially due to substantial differences in patient demographics and clinical routine. Conclusions: Here we describe a formula, requiring only variables routinely acquired in hospitals, which allows to estimate death probabilities of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. The model could be used as a decision support for earlier discharge of low-risk patients to reduce the burden on the health care system. The model could further be used to monitor whether patients should be admitted to hospital in countries with health care systems with emphasis on outpatient care (e.g. Sweden).",Stefan Heber; David Pereyra; Waltraud Schrottmaier; Kerstin Kammerer; Jonas Santol; Erich Pawelka; Markus Hana; Alexander Scholz; Markus Liu; Agnes Hell; Klara Heiplik; Benno Lickefett; Sebastian Haverall; Marianna Traugott; Matthias Neuboeck; Christian Schoergenhofer; Tamara Seitz; Christa Firbas; Mario Karolyi; Guenter Weiss; Bernd Jilma; Charlotte Thalin; Rosa Bellmann-Weiler; Helmut Salzer; Michael JM Fischer; Alexander Zoufaly; Alice Assinger,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248563,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.20248563,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
133,How to coordinate vaccination and social distancing to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks,"The world is waiting for a vaccine to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, once it becomes available, there will not be enough to vaccinate everybody at once. Therefore, vaccination and social distancing has to be coordinated. In this paper, we provide some insight on this topic using optimization-based control on an age-differentiated compartmental model. For real-life decision making we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run without overburdening the intensive care units it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group. Furthermore, large amounts of a vaccine with a lower success rate allows for more reduction of the social distancing than smaller amounts of a vaccine with higher success rate.",Sara Grundel; Stefan Heyder; Thomas Hotz; Tobias K.

134,"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Vaccine Hesitancy among Farmworkers from Monterey County, California","Objectives. To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on farmworkers from Monterey County, California. Methods. We recruited adult farmworkers (n=1115) between July 16, 2020 and November 30, 2020. We collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, economic and social stressors experienced during COVID-19, and willingness to be vaccinated via interviews by phone. Results. Study participants, particularly female farmworkers, reported adverse effects of the pandemic on their mental health and home environment (e.g., 24% overall reported depression and/or anxiety symptoms). The pandemic also resulted in greater financial burden for many farmworkers, with 37% food insecure and 51% unable to pay bills. Half of respondents reported that they were extremely likely to be vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy was most common in participants who were women, younger, born in the United States, and living in more rural areas. Conclusions. We found that the pandemic has substantially impacted the mental and physical health and economic and food security of farmworkers. Public Health Implications.

135,Impact of housing conditions on changes in youth's mental health following the initial national COVID-19 lockdown: A cohort study,"Abstract Objective To investigate whether changes in youth's mental health were dependent on housing conditions during the initial Danish national COVID-19 lockdown. Design Cohort Setting The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) at participants' 18th year of life and subsequently three weeks into the initial national lockdown (April 2020) Participants 7445 youth aged 18 to 23 Exposure Housing conditions measured as direct access to outdoor spaces, urbanicity, household density, and household composition during the lockdown. Main outcome measures Comparisons of before and during lockdown mental health parameters measured as adjusted mean difference and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for changes in scores of mental well-being (Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS)) and Quality of Life (QOL; adapted Cantril ladder). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % CI for onset of low mental well-being (score [&le;]20), low QoL (score [&le;]5), and loneliness. Results Participants had a median age of 20 years at lockdown and were predominantly female. Youth without direct access to outdoor spaces had a greater decrease in mental well-being compared to those with a garden, mean difference: -0.83 (95 % CI -1.19,-0.48), and correspondingly greater odds of onset of low mental well-being, OR: 1.68 (95 % CI 1.15, 2.47). Youth in higher density households and those living alone also had greater odds of onset of low mental well-being (OR: 1.23 (95 % CI 1.05, 1.43) and OR: 1.47 (95 % CI 1.05, 2.07), respectively). Onset of low QoL was associated with living in denser households, as well as living alone. Living alone more than doubled odds of onset of loneliness, OR: 2.12 (95 % CI 1.59, 2.82). Conclusion Youth's mental health declined from before the pandemic to three weeks into the initial national lockdown. However, not all youth were equally affected and our findings inform policy makers that youth living alone, in denser households, and without direct access to outdoor spaces are especially vulnerable.",Jonathan Groot; Amélie Cléo Keller; Andrea Joensen; Tri-Long Nguyen; Anne-Marie Nybo Andersen; Katrine Strandberg-Larsen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20245191,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20245191,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
136,Population Changes in Seroprevalence among a Statewide Sample in the United States,"Antibody surveillance provides essential information for public health officials to work with communities to discuss the spread and impact of COVID-19 in communities. At the state of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the diagnostic testing was limited with many asymptomatic cases. Irrespective of symptom severity, antibodies develop within two to three weeks after disease onset and may persist 6 months or more, antibody surveillance is an important tool for tracking trends in past infections across diverse populations. This study includes adults and children recruited from a statewide sample of past 2014-2020 Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) participants. SHOW, an ongoing population-based health examination study including a randomly selected sample of households, partnered with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene to conduct longitudinal antibody surveillance using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. WAVEs I and II of three planned WAVES were complete in mid-summer to late fall respectively, WAVE III is planned for early 2021. From WAVE I to WAVE II, crude estimates of seroprevalence in the total study population increased four to five-fold from 1.9% to 7.3%. Within the statewide probability sample, weighted estimates increased from an estimated 1.6% (95% CI:0.6-2.5%) seropositivity to 6.8% (95% CI:4.3-9.4%). Seroprevalence varied by health region in both waves, and significant disparities in smaller population groups were identified.

137,Assessment of effective mitigation and prediction of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany using demographic information and spatial resolution,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are important to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases as long as no vaccination or outstanding medical treatments are available. We assess the effectiveness of the sets of non-phar\-ma\-ceu\-ti\-cal interventions that were in place during the course of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in Germany. Our results are based on hybrid models, combining SIR-type models on local scales with spatial resolution. In order to account for the age-dependence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we include realistic pre-pandemic and recently recorded contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions will occur on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. In order to account for spatial heterogeneity, we use a graph approach and we include high-quality information on commuting activities combined with traveling information from social networks. The remaining uncertainty will be accounted for by a large number of randomized simulation runs. Based on the derived factors for the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions over the past months, we provide different forecast scenarios for the upcoming time.",Martin J.

138,COVID-19: An analysis of social media and research publication activity during the early stages of the pandemic,"Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid dissemination of scientific and medical discovery. Social media (SoMe) has become an invaluable platform in science and medicine. This study analyzed activity of SoMe (Twitter), preprints, and publications related to COVID-19 and gastroenterology (GI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data from Twitter, preprint servers and PubMed was collected and analyzed from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organ specific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity; any associations were identified. Results: Over the 6-month period, there were 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7,164 publications, and 4,702 preprints. Twitter activity peaked during March while preprints and publications peaked in April 2020. Strong correlations were identified between Twitter and both preprints and publications activity (p<0.001 for both). While COVID-19 data across the 3 platforms concentrated on pulmonology/critical care, the majority of GI tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal GI (LGI). There were significant associations between Twitter activity and research for all GI subfields (p=0.009 for LGI, p=0.006 for hepatology and IBD, p=0.007 for endoscopy), except pancreatology (p=0.2). Twitter activity was highest in the US (7,331 tweets) whereas PubMed activity was highest in China (1,768 publications). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the utility of SoMe as a vehicle for disseminating scientific information during a public health crisis.

139,Occupational exposures associated with being a COVID-19 case; evidence from three case-control studies,"Background The evidence on risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings is sparse, yet this information is key to inform public health action. We investigated factors associated with being a COVID-19 case using data collected through contact tracing. Methods We conducted three retrospective, frequency-matched case-control studies between August 2020 and October 2020 using case data from the NHS Test and Trace programme. Controls were obtained through Market Research Panels. Multivariable analyses provided adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for multiple community exposure settings. We analysed the results in meta-analyses using random effects models to obtain pooled odds ratios (pORs). Results Across all study periods, there was strong statistical evidence that working in healthcare (pOR 2.87, aOR range 2.72-3.08), social care (pOR 4.15, aOR range 2.46-5.41) or hospitality (pOR 2.36, aOR range 2.01-2.63) were associated with increased odds of being a COVID-19 case. There was also evidence that working in warehouse setting was associated with increased odds (pOR 3.86, aOR range 1.06-14.19), with a substantial increase in odds observed over the study periods. A similar pattern was also observed in education and construction. Conclusions The studies indicate that some workplace settings are associated with increased odds of being a case. However, it is not possible to determine how much of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 took place within the workplace, and how much was associated with social, household or transport exposures.",Iina Hiironen; Maria Saavedra-Campos; Jennifer Panitz; Thomas Ma; Olisaeloka Nsonwu; Andre Charlett; Gareth Hughes; Isabel Oliver,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248161,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.20248161,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,True
140,In Vitro Safety Clinical Trial of the Cardiac Liability of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as COVID19 Polytherapy,"Despite global efforts, there are no effective FDA-approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Potential therapeutics focus on repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities. Here we report on a preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to assess cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in a mock clinical trial. The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing. Chronic exposure to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and increased QT interval from day 6 onwards. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onwards and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results closely mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Furthermore, biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients serum, were identified for negative effects of single drug or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection. The cardiac MPS can predict clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities. This high content system can help clinicians design their trials, rapidly project cardiac outcomes, and define new monitoring biomarkers to accelerate access of patients to safe COVID-19 therapeutics.",Kevin Healy; Berenice Charrez; verena charwat; brian siemons; Evan Miller; andrew edwards; henrik finsberg,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423869,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423869,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,False

142,Transcriptional and epi-transcriptional dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during cellular infection,"SARS-CoV-2 uses subgenomic (sg)RNA to produce viral proteins for replication and immune evasion. We applied long-read RNA and cDNA sequencing to in vitro human and primate infection models to study transcriptional dynamics. Transcription-regulating sequence (TRS)-dependent sgRNA was upregulated earlier in infection than TRS-independent sgRNA. An abundant class of TRS-independent sgRNA consisting of a portion of ORF1ab containing nsp1 joined to ORF10 and 3prime UTR was upregulated at 48 hours post infection in human cell lines. We identified double-junction sgRNA containing both TRS-dependent and independent junctions. We found multiple sites at which the SARS-CoV-2 genome is consistently more modified than sgRNA, and that sgRNA modifications are stable across transcript clusters, host cells and time since infection.

143,Evolutionary tracking of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants highlights intricate balance of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations,"The currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has accounted for millions of infections and deaths across the globe. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are being published daily in various forums and this big data availability has allowed unprecedented access into the mutational patterns of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Genomic information has further been utilized in public health decision making through molecular epidemiology, transmission tracking, and vaccine design. We made use of the same sea of genomic information for conducting a detailed phylogenetic analysis and identifying lineage-specific mutations. The cataloged mutations were analyzed for their stabilizing or destabilizing impact on E, M, N, and S viral proteins that are key for infection, virulence, and pathogenesis. The same proteins make crucial components of vaccines recently approved and in development. We recorded positive natural selection of D614G, S477N, A222V V1176F variants and a global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1. In addition, a positive natural selection of Q57H (B.1.X), R203K/G204R (B.1.1.X), T85I (B.1.2-B.1.3), G15S+T428I (C.X) and I120F (D.X) variants was observed. Overall, we recorded a striking balance between stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, therefore incredibly well-maintained protein structures. With selection pressures in the form of newly developed vaccines and therapeutics to mount soon in coming months, the task of mapping of viral mutations and recording of their impact on key viral proteins would be crucial to pre-emptively catch any escape mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 may evolve for.",Jobin John Jacob; Karthick Vasudevan; Agila Kumari Pragasam; Karthik Gunasekaran; Gagandeep Kang; Balaji Veeraraghavan; Ankur Mutreja,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423920,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.22.423920,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,False
144,SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance in Costa Rica: Evidence of a Divergent Population and an Increased Detection of a Spike T1117I Mutation,"Genome sequencing is a key strategy in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. Latin America is the hardest hit region of the world, accumulating almost 25% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. Costa Rica was first exemplary for the region in its pandemic control, declaring a swift state of emergency on March 16th that led to a low quantity of cases, until measures were lifted in early May. From the first detected case in March 6th to November 30th almost 140 000 cases have been reported in Costa Rica, 99.5% of them from May onwards. We analyzed the genomic variability during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Costa Rica using 138 sequences, 52 from the first months of the pandemic, and 86 from the current wave. Three GISAID clades (G, GH, and GR) and three PANGOLIN lineages (B.1, B.1.1, and B.1.291) are predominant, with phylogenetic relationships that are in line with the results of other Latin American countries suggesting introduction and multiple re-introductions from other regions of the world. The sequences from the first months of the pandemic grouped in lineage B.1 and B.1.5 mainly, suggesting low undetected circulation and re-introductions of new lineages not detected in the country during early stages of the pandemic due to the extreme lockdown measures. The whole-genome variant calling analysis identified a total of 177 distinct variants. These correspond mostly to synonymous mutations (41.2%, 73) but 54.8% correspond to non-synonymous mutations (97). The 177 variants showed an expected distribution of a power-law distribution: 106 single nucleotide mutations were identified in single sequences, only 16 single nucleotide mutations were found in >5% sequences, and only three single nucleotide mutations in >25% genomes. These mutations were distributed all over the genome. However, 61.5% were present in ORF1ab, and 15.0% in Spike gene and 9.6% in the Nucleocapsid. Additionally, the prevalence of worldwide-found variant D614G in the Spike (98.6%), ORF8 L84S (1.5%) is similar to what is been found elsewhere. Interestingly, the prevalence of mutation T1117I in the Spike has increased during the current pandemic wave beginning in May 2020 in Costa Rica, reaching 14.5% detection in the full genome analyses in August 2020. This variant has been observed in less than 1% of the GISAID reported sequences in other countries. Structural modeling of the Spike protein with the T1117I mutation suggest a possible effect on the viral oligomerization. Nevertheless, in-vitro experiments are required to prove this in-silico analyses. In conclusion, genome analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences over the course of COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica suggests re-introduction of lineages from other countries as travel bans and measures were lifted, similar to results found in other studies, but the Spike-T1117I variant needs to be monitored and studied in further analyses as part of the surveillance program during the pandemic.",Jose Arturo Molina Mora Sr.; Estela Cordero-Laurent; Adriana Godinez; Melany Calderon; Hebleen Brenes; Claudio Soto-Garita; Cristian Perez-Corrales; - COINGESA-CR Consorcio Interinstitucional de Estudios Genomicos del SARS-CoV-2 Costa Rica; Jan Felix Drexler; Andres Moreira-Soto; Eugenia Corrales-Aguilar; Francisco Duarte-Martinez,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423850,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423850,2020-12-22,2020-12-22,,False
145,"SARS-CoV-2 testing of 11,884 healthcare workers at an acute NHS hospital trust in England: a retrospective analysis","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are known to be at increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, although whether these risks are equal across all roles is uncertain. Here we report a retrospective analysis of a large real-world dataset obtained from 10 March to 6 July 2020 in an NHS Foundation Trust in England with 17,126 employees. 3,338 HCWs underwent symptomatic PCR testing (14.4% positive, 2.8% of all staff) and 11,103 HCWs underwent serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (8.4% positive, 5.5% of all staff). Seropositivity was lower than other hospital settings in England but higher than community estimates. Increased test positivity rates were observed in HCWs from BAME backgrounds and residents in areas of higher social deprivation. A logistic regression model adjusting for these factors showed significant increases in the odds of testing positive in certain occupational groups, most notably domestic services staff, nurses and health-care assistants. PCR testing of symptomatic HCWs appeared to underestimate overall infection levels, probably due to asymptomatic seroconversion. Clinical outcomes were reassuring, with only a small minority of HCWs with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation (2.3%) or ICU management (0.7%) and with no deaths. Despite a relatively low level of HCW infection compared to other UK cohorts, there were nevertheless important differences in test positivity rates between occupational groups, robust to adjustment for demographic factors such as ethnic background and social deprivation. Quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to better understand the factors contributing to this risk.

146,"T cell activation, highly armed cytotoxic cells and a sharp shift in monocytes CD300 receptors expression is characteristic of patients with severe COVID-19","COVID-19 manifests with a wide diversity of clinical phenotypes characterized by dysfunctional and exaggerated host immune responses. Many results have been described on the status of the immune system of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but there are still aspects that have not been fully characterized. In this study, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. We performed flow cytometric studies and correlated the data with the clinical features and clinical laboratory values of patients. Both conventional and unsupervised data analyses concluded that patients with severe disease are characterized, among others, by a higher state of activation in all T cell subsets, higher expression of perforin and granzyme B in cytotoxic cells, expansion of adaptive NK cells and the accumulation of activated and immature dysfunctional monocytes which are identified by a low expression of HLA-DR and an intriguing abrupt change in the expression pattern of CD300 receptors. More importantly, correlation analysis showed a strong association between the alterations in the immune cells and the clinical signs of severity.

148,"Safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152 (a phase 2, double-blind, randomised controlled trial) and the persistence of immune responses from a phase 1 follow-up report","Background BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3{micro} or 6{micro}) formulated with a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG). Earlier, we reported findings from a phase 1 (vaccination regimen on days 0 and 14) randomised, double-blind trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 and one control arm containing Algel (without antigen). Two formulations were selected for the phase 2 (days 0 and 28) study. Here, we report interim findings of a controlled, randomised, double-blind trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, 3{micro} and 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG. Methods We conducted a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152. A total of 380 healthy children and adults were randomised to receive two vaccine formulations (n=190 each) with 3{micro} with Algel-IMDG and 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered (four weeks apart). Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were blinded to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was seroconversion (4-fold above baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation (PRNT50). Secondary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated. A follow-up blood draw was collected from phase 1 participants at day 104 (three months after the second dose). Findings Among 921 participants screened between Sep 7-13, 2020, 380 participants were randomised to the safety and immunogenicity population. The PRNT50 seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies on day 56 were 92.9% (88.2, 96.2) and 98.3% (95.1, 99.6) in the 3{micro} and 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. Higher neutralising titres (2-fold) were observed in the phase 2 study than in the phase 1 study (p<0.05). Both vaccine groups elicited more Th1 cytokines than Th2 cytokines. After two doses, the proportion (95% CI) of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were 9.7% (6.9, 13.2) and 10.3% (7.4, 13.8) in the 3{micro} and 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the groups. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. Phase 1 follow-up immunological samples at day 104 showed seroconversion in 73.5% (63.6, 81.9), 81.1% (71.4, 88.1), and 73.1% (62.9, 81.8) of individuals in the 3{micro} with Algel-IMDG, 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG, and 6{micro} with Algel groups, respectively. Interpretation In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.

149,"Minimizing exposure to respiratory droplets, 'jet riders' and aerosols in air-conditioned hospital rooms by a 'Shield-and-Sink' strategy","ObjectivesIn COVID-19, transfer of respiratory materials transmits disease but the interplay of droplet and aerosol physics, physiology and environment is not fully understood. To advance understanding of disease transmission mechanisms and to find novel exposure minimization strategies, we studied cough-driven material transport modes and the efficacy of control strategies.

Design and methodsComputer simulations and real-world experiments were used for integrating an intensive care setting, multi- physics, and physiology. Patient-focused airflow management and air purification strategies were examined computationally and validated by submicron particle exhalation imaging in volunteers.

ResultsRespiratory materials ejected by cough exhibited four transport modes: long-distance ballistic, short- distance ballistic, ""jet rider"", and aerosol modes. Interaction with air conditioning driven flow contaminated a hospital room rapidly. Different than large droplets or aerosols, ""jet rider"" droplets travelled with the turbulent air jet initially, but fell out at a distance, were not well eliminated by air conditioning and exposed bystanders at larger distance and longer time; their size predisposes them to preferential capture in the nasal mucosa, the primordial COVID-19 infection site. ""Cough shields"" captured large droplets but induced lateral dispersion of aerosols and jet riders. An air purification device alone had limited efficacy. A ""Shield and Sink"" approach combining ""cough shields"" with ""virus sinks"" miminized exposure to all secretions in modeling and real-life experiments.

Conclusions""Jet riders"" have characteristics of highly efficient respiratory infection vectors and may play a role in Covid- 19 transmission. Exposure to all droplet types can be minimized through an easily implemented ""Shield and Sink"" strategy.

150,Immunological and pathological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 challenge after formalin-inactivated vaccine immunisation of ferrets and rhesus macaques,"There is an urgent requirement for safe and effective vaccines to prevent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. A concern for the development of new viral vaccines is the potential to induce vaccine-enhanced disease (VED). This was reported in several preclinical studies with both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS vaccines but has not been reported with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We have used ferret and rhesus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 to assess the potential for VED in animals vaccinated with formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (FIV) formulated with Alhydrogel, compared to a negative control vaccine in ferrets or unvaccinated macaques. We showed no evidence of enhanced disease in ferrets or rhesus macaques given FIV except for mild transient enhanced disease seen at seven days post infection in ferrets. This increased lung pathology was observed early in the infection (day 7) but was resolved by day 15. We also demonstrate that formaldehyde treatment of SARS-CoV-2 reduces exposure of the spike receptor binding domain providing a mechanistic explanation for suboptimal immunity.",Kevin R Bewley; Karen E R Gooch; Kelly M Thomas; Stephanie R Longet; Nathan Wiblin; Laura Hunter; Kin Chan; Phillip Brown; Rebecca A Russell; Catherine Ho; Gillian Slack; Holly E Humphries; Leonie Alden; Lauren Allen; Marilyn Aram; Natalie Baker; Emily Brunt; Rebecca Cobb; Susan Fotheringham; Debbie Harris; Chelsea Kennard; Stephanie Leung; Kathryn A Ryan; Howard Tolley; Nadina Wand; Andrew White; Laura Sibley; Charlotte Sarfas; Geoff Pearson; Emma Rayner; Xiaochao Xue; Teresa Lambe; Sue Charlton; Sarah C Gilbert; Quentin Sattentau; Fergus Gleeson; Yper Hall; Simon G.

151,A recombinant protein SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine elicits high-titer neutralizing antibodies in macaques.,"Vaccines that generate robust and long-lived protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently required. We assessed the potential of vaccine candidates based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike in cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) by examining their ability to generate spike binding antibodies with neutralizing activity. Antigens were derived from two distinct regions of the spike S1 subunit, either the N-terminal domain (NTD) or an extended C-terminal domain containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and were fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain. Three groups of 2 animals each were immunized with either antigen, alone or in combination. The development of antibody responses was evaluated through 20 weeks post-immunization. A robust IgG response to the spike protein was detected as early as 2 weeks after immunization with either protein and maintained for over 20 weeks. Sera from animals immunized with antigens derived from the RBD were able to prevent binding of soluble spike proteins to the ACE2 receptor, shown by in vitro binding assays, while sera from animals immunized with the NTD alone lacked this activity. Crucially, sera from animals immunized with the RBD but not the NTD had potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, with titers in excess of 10,000, greatly exceeding that typically found in convalescent humans. Neutralizing activity persisted for more than 20 weeks.

152,Fatty Acid Synthase inhibition prevents palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2 SpikeProtein and improves survival of mice infected with murine hepatitis virus.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the causative agent of COVID19 that has infected >76M people and caused >1.68M deaths. The SARS-CoV2 Spike glycoprotein is responsible for the attachment and infection of target cells. The viral Spike protein serves the basis for many putative therapeutic countermeasures including vaccines, blocking and neutralizing antibodies, and decoy receptors. Here we investigated the cytosolic domain of Spike and its interaction with the protein palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5. The Spike protein is palmitoylated on multiple juxtamembrane cysteine residues conserved among coronavirus. Increased abundance of ZDHHC5 resulted in hyper-palmitoylation, while silencing of ZDHHC5 reduced the ability of the human CoV 229E to form viral plaques in cell monolayers. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase using the pharmacological inhibitor TVB-3166 eliminated palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2 Spike. Additionally, TVB-3166 attenuated plaque formation and promoted the survival of mice from a lethal murine CoV infection. Thus, inhibition of the Spike protein palmitoylation has the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV infections.",Minhyoung Lee; Katrina Mekhail; Michael Sugiyama; Elyse Latreille; Costin N Antonescu; Greg D Fairn,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423603,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423603,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False
153,In vitro measurements of protein-protein interactions show that antibody affinity governs the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 binding in convalescent serum,"The humoral immune response plays a key role in suppressing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular determinants underlying the neutralization of the virus remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2-spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the binding energies of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein, and the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody. These experiments represent a new type of in-solution receptor binding competition assay, which has further potential areas of application ranging from decisions on donor selection for convalescent plasma therapy, to identification of lead candidates in therapeutic antibody development, and vaccine development.",Sebastian Fiedler; Monika A.

154,Evidence of a dysregulated Vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infected patient's lung cells,"Although a defective vitamin D pathway has been widely suspected to be associated in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, the status of the vitamin D pathway and vitamin D-modulated genes in lung cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. To understand the significance of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes modulated by vitamin D were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patients cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Network analysis of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes identified pathways in the immune system, NF-{kappa}B/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results provided computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D pathway in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Bijesh George; Ravikumar Amjesh; Aswathy Mary Paul; Santhosh Kumar TR; Madhavan Radhakrishna Pillai; Rakesh Kumar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423733,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.21.423733,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False
155,From infection to immunity: understanding the response to SARS-CoV2 through in-silico modeling,"Background: Immune system conditions of the patient is a key factor in COVID-19 infection survival. A growing number of studies have focused on immunological determinants to develop better biomarkers for therapies. Aim: The dynamics of the insurgence of immunity is at the core of the both SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and therapies. This paper addresses a fundamental question in the management of the infection: can we describe the insurgence (and the span) of immunity in COVID-19? The in-silico model developed here answers this question at individual (personalized) and population levels. We simulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the impact of infecting viral load, affinity to the ACE2 receptor and age in the artificially infected population on the course of the disease. Methods: We use a stochastic agent-based immune simulation platform to construct a virtual cohort of infected individuals with age-dependent varying degree of immune competence. We use a parameter setting to reproduce known inter-patient variability and general epidemiological statistics. Results: We reproduce in-silico a number of clinical observations and we identify critical factors in the statistical evolution of the infection. In particular we evidence the importance of the humoral response over the cytotoxic response and find that the antibody titers measured after day 25 from the infection is a prognostic factor for determining the clinical outcome of the infection. Our modeling framework uses COVID-19 infection to demonstrate the actionable effectiveness of simulating the immune response at individual and population levels. The model developed is able to explain and interpret observed patterns of infection and makes verifiable temporal predictions. Within the limitations imposed by the simulated environment, this work proposes in a quantitative way that the great variability observed in the patient outcomes in real life can be the mere result of subtle variability in the infecting viral load and immune competence in the population. In this work we i) show the power of model predictions, ii) identify the clinical end points that could be more suitable for computational modeling of COVID-19 immune response, iii) define the resolution and amount of data required to empower this class of models for translational medicine purposes and, iv) we exemplify how computational modeling of immune response provides an important light to discuss hypothesis and design new experiments.",Filippo Castiglione; Debashrito Deb; Anurag P.

156,"Prevalent, protective, and convergent IgG recognition of SARS-CoV-2 non-RBD spike epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent plasma","Although humoral immunity is essential for control of SARS-CoV-2, the molecular composition, binding epitopes and effector functions of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that circulate in blood plasma following infection are unknown. Proteomic deconvolution of the circulating IgG repertoire (Ig-Seq1) to the spike ectodomain (S-ECD2) in four convalescent study subjects revealed that the plasma response is oligoclonal and directed predominantly (>80%) to S-ECD epitopes that lie outside the receptor binding domain (RBD). When comparing antibodies directed to either the RBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD) or the S2 subunit (S2) in one subject, just four IgG lineages (1 anti-S2, 2 anti-NTD and 1 anti-RBD) accounted for 93.5% of the repertoire. Although the anti-RBD and one of the anti-NTD antibodies were equally potently neutralizing in vitro, we nonetheless found that the anti-NTD antibody was sufficient for protection to lethal viral challenge, either alone or in combination as a cocktail where it dominated the effect of the other plasma antibodies. We identified in vivo protective plasma anti-NTD antibodies in 3/4 subjects analyzed and discovered a shared class of antibodies targeting the NTD that utilize unmutated or near-germline IGHV1-24, the most electronegative IGHV gene in the human genome. Structural analysis revealed that binding to NTD is dominated by interactions with the heavy chain, accounting for 89% of the entire interfacial area, with germline residues uniquely encoded by IGHV1-24 contributing 20% (149 [A]2). Together with recent reports of germline IGHV1-24 antibodies isolated by B-cell cloning3,4 our data reveal a class of shared IgG antibodies that are readily observed in convalescent plasma and underscore the role of NTD-directed antibodies in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",William N Voss; Yixuan J Hou; Nicole V Johnson; Jin Eyun Kim; George Delidakis; Andrew P Horton; Foteini Bartzoka; Chelsea J Paresi; Yuri Tanno; Shawn A Abbasi; Whitney Pickens; Katia George; Daniel R Boutz; Dalton M Towers; Jonathan R McDaniel; Daniel Billick; Jule Goike; Lori Rowe; Dhwani Batra; Jan Pohl; Justin Lee; Shivaprakash Gangappa; Suryaprakash Sambhara; Michelle Gadush; Nianshuang Wang; Maria D Person; Brent L Iverson; Jimmy D Gollihar; John Dye; Andrew Herbert; Ralph S Baric; Jason S McLellan; George Georgiou; Jason J Lavinder; Gregory C Ippolito,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423708,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.20.423708,2020-12-21,2020-12-21,,False
157,Binding strength and hydrogen bond numbers between Covid-19 RBD and HVR of antibody,"The global battle against the Covid-19 pandemic relies strongly on the human defence of antibody, which is assumed to bind the antigens Receptor Binding Domain with its Hypervariable Region. Due to the similarity to other viruses such as SARS, however, our understanding of the antibody-virus interaction has been largely limited to the genomic sequencing, which poses serious challenges to the containment, vaccine exploration and rapid serum testing. Based on the physical/chemical nature of the interaction, infrared spectroscopy was employed to reveal the binding disparity, when unusual temperature dependence was discovered from the 1550cm-1 absorption band, attributed to the hydrogen bonds by carboxyl/amino groups, binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and closely resembled SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 antibodies. The infrared absorption intensity, associated with the number of hydrogen bonds, was found to increase sharply between 27{degrees}C and 31{degrees}C, with the relative absorbance matches at 37{degrees}C the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types (19 vs 12). Meanwhile the ratio of bonds at 27{degrees}C, calculated by thermodynamic exponentials rather than by the laymans guess, produces at least 5% inaccuracy. As a result, the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody will be more conclusive beyond 31{degrees}C, instead of at the usual room temperature of 20{degrees}C - 25{degrees}C, when the vaccine research and antibody diagnosis would likely be undermined. Beyond genomic sequencing, the temperature dependence, as well as the bond number match at 37{degrees}C between relative absorbance and the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types, are not only of clinical significance in particular, but also of a sample for the physical/chemical understanding of the vaccine-antibody interactions in general.",Ryan Taoran Wang; Alex Fan Xu; Qi Zhou; Tinglu Song; Kelvin J.

158,The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein disrupts the cooperative function of human cardiac pericytes - endothelial cells through CD147 receptor-mediated signalling: a potential non-infective mechanism of COVID-19 microvascular disease,"BackgroundSevere coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests as a life-threatening microvascular syndrome. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. To date, it is still not known if the S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is able to trigger vascular cell signalling and provoke cell dysfunction.

MethodsWe investigated the effects of the recombinant, stabilised S protein on primary human cardiac pericytes (PCs) signalling and function. Endpoints included cell viability, proliferation, migration, cooperation with endothelial cells (ECs) in angiogenesis assays, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors ACE2 and CD147, we explored which receptor mediates the S protein signalling in PCs.

FindingsWe show, for the first time, that the recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in cardiac PCs. This was documented as: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support EC network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death. Furthermore, the S protein stimulates the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in cardiac PCs. Accordingly, the neutralization of CD147, using a blocking antibody, prevented the activation of ERK1/2 and partially rescued the PC function in the presence of the S protein.

InterpretationOur findings suggest the new, intriguing hypothesis that the S protein may elicit vascular cell dysfunction, potentially amplifying, or perpetuating, the damage caused by the whole coronavirus. This mechanism may have clinical and therapeutic implication.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. Co-receptors and host cell proteases may also be involved. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the well-recognized entry receptor used by the virus in respiratory epithelial cells; it is also abundantly expressed in the human heart. Alongside ACE2, CD147 has recently emerged as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, it is not clear if SARS-CoV-2 triggers adverse responses in cardiac vascular mural cells. Likewise, no investigation was devoted to verifying if the recombinant S protein alone can mimic the whole virus signalling.

Added value of this studyThis study provides the first evidence that the recombinant S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is capable of eliciting cellular signalling in human cardiac pericytes, thereby inducing cell dysfunction. In addition, this study proposes CD147 as the leading receptor mediating S protein signalling in cardiac pericytes.

Implications of all the available evidenceThese reports imply that fragments of the S protein might be able to elicit vascular cell dysfunction.

Here we show that the combination of a powerful erythroid-specific expression system and transgene codon optimization yields high expression levels of the HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CCR5, as well as a CD4-glycophorin A (CD4-GpA) fusion protein on enucleated RBCs. Engineered RBCs expressing CD4 and CCR5 were efficiently infected by HIV-1, but CD4 or CD4-GpA expression in the absence of CCR5 was sufficient to potently neutralize HIV-1 in vitro. To facilitate continuous large-scale production of engineered RBCs, we generated erythroblast cell lines stably expressing CD4-GpA or ACE2-GpA fusion proteins, which produced potent RBC viral traps against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

160,pH and Receptor Induced Confirmational Changes- Implications Towards S1 Dissociation of SARS-CoV2 Spike Glycoprotein,"Viruses, being obligate intracellular parasites, must first attach themselves and gain entry into host cells. Viral fusion machinery is the central player in the viral attachment process in almost every viral disease. Viruses have incorporated an array of efficient fusion proteins on their surfaces to bind efficiently to host cell receptors. They make use of the host proteolytic enzymes to rearrange their surface protein(s) into the form which facilitates their binding to host-cell membrane proteins and subsequently, fusion. This stage of viral entry is very critical and has many therapeutic implications. The current global pandemic of COVID-19 has sparked severe health crisis and economic shutdowns. SARS-CoV2, the etiological agent of the disease has led to millions of deaths and brought the scientific community together in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis and mortality. Like other viral fusion machinery, CoV2 spike (S) glycoprotein-  The Demogorgon poses the same questions about viral-host cell fusion. The intermediate stages of S protein-mediated viral fusion are unclear owing to the lack of structural insights and concrete biochemical evidence. The mechanism of conformational transition is still unclear. S protein binding and fusion with host cell receptors, Eg., angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is accompanied by cleavage of S1/S2 subunits. To track the key events of viral-host cell fusion, we have identified (in silico) that low pH-induced conformational change and ACE-2 binding events promote S1 dissociation.

Here, using an objective analytical method, we present the changes in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19 over time. The virus has mutated in three major directions 2, with three groups remaining to date. The basic structure of the groups was completed by April and shared across all continents. However, the virus continued to mutate independently in each country after the borders were closed. In particular, the virus mutated before the occurrence of a second or third peak. It seems that the mutations conferred higher infectivity to the virus, because of which the virus overcame previously effective protections. Currently, each country may possess such a unique stronger variant, which may cause another peak in other countries.

Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) accounted for only 3% of P323L and 4% of Q57H mutations in Africa. Comparatively low infections in SSA were attributed to the low frequency of the D614G clade in earlier samples (25% vs 67% global). Higher disease burden occurred in countries with higher D614G frequencies (Egypt=98%, Morocco=90%, Tunisia=52%, South Africa) with D614G as the first confirmed case. V367F, D364Y, V483A and G476S mutations associated with efficient ACE2 receptor binding and severe disease were not observed in Africa. 95% of all RdRp mutations were deaminations leading to CpG depletion and possible attenuation of virulence.

164,"The challenges of the coming mass vaccination and exit strategy in prevention and control of COVID-19, a modelling study","With success in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, it is urgent and challenging to analyse how the coming large-scale vaccination in the population and the growing public desire of relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) interact to impact the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using mathematical models, we focus on two aspects: 1) how the vaccination program should be designed to balance the dynamic exit of NPIs; 2) how much the vaccination coverage is needed to avoid a second wave of the epidemics when the NPIs exit in stages. We address this issue globally, and take six countries--China, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, UK, and US--in our case study. We showed that a dynamic vaccination program in three stages can be an effective approach to balance the dynamic exit of the NPIs in terms of mitigating the epidemics. The vaccination rates and the accumulative vaccination coverage in these countries are estimated by fitting the model to the real data. We observed that the required effective vaccination coverages are greatly different to balance the dynamic exit of NPIs in these countries, providing a quantitative criterion for the requirement of an integrative package of NPIs. We predicted the epidemics under different vaccination rates for these countries, and showed that the vaccination can significantly decrease the peak value of a future wave. Furthermore, we found that a lower vaccination coverage can result in a subsequent wave once the NPIs exit. Therefore, there is a critical (minimum) vaccination coverage, depending on effectiveness of NPIs to avoid a subsequent wave. We estimated the critical vaccination coverages for China, Brazil, and Indonesia under different scenarios. In conclusion, we quantitatively showed that the dynamic vaccination program can be the effective approach to supplement or even eventually replace NPIs in mitigating the epidemics and avoiding future waves, and we suggest that country level-based exit strategies of the NPIs should be considered, according to the possible quarantine rate and testing ability, and the accessibility, affordability and efficiency of the vaccines.",Biao Tang; Peiyu Liu; Jie Yang; Jianhong Wu; Yanni Xiao; Sanyi Tang,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248478,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248478,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
165,Real-world data suggest antibody positivity to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a decreased risk of future infection,"ImportanceThere is limited evidence regarding whether the presence of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a decreased risk of future infection. Understanding susceptibility to infection and the role of immune memory is important for identifying at-risk populations and could have implications for vaccine deployment.

ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to evaluate subsequent evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) among individuals who are antibody-positive compared with those who are antibody-negative, using real-world data.

DesignThis was an observational descriptive cohort study.

ParticipantsThe study utilized a national sample to create cohorts from a de-identified dataset composed of commercial laboratory test results, open and closed medical and pharmacy claims, electronic health records, hospital billing (chargemaster) data, and payer enrollment files from the United States. Patients were indexed as antibody-positive or antibody-negative according to their first SARS-CoV-2 antibody test recorded in the database. Patients with more than 1 antibody test on the index date where results were discordant were excluded.

Main Outcomes/MeasuresPrimary endpoints were index antibody test results and post-index diagnostic NAAT results, with infection defined as a positive diagnostic test post-index, as measured in 30-day intervals (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, >90 days). Additional measures included demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics at the time of the index antibody test, such as recorded signs and symptoms or prior evidence of COVID-19 (diagnoses or NAAT+) and recorded comorbidities.

ResultsWe included 3,257,478 unique patients with an index antibody test. Of these, 2,876,773 (88.3%) had a negative index antibody result, 378,606 (11.6%) had a positive index antibody result, and 2,099 (0.1%) had an inconclusive index antibody result. Patients with a negative antibody test were somewhat older at index than those with a positive result (mean of 48 versus 44 years). A fraction (18.4%) of individuals who were initially seropositive converted to seronegative over the follow up period. During the follow-up periods, the ratio (CI) of positive NAAT results among individuals who had a positive antibody test at index versus those with a negative antibody test at index was 2.85 (2.73 - 2.97) at 0-30 days, 0.67 (0.6 - 0.74) at 31-60 days, 0.29 (0.24 - 0.35) at 61-90 days), and 0.10 (0.05 - 0.19) at >90 days.

ConclusionsPatients who display positive antibody tests are initially more likely to have a positive NAAT, consistent with prolonged RNA shedding, but over time become markedly less likely to have a positive NAAT. This result suggests seropositivity using commercially available assays is associated with protection from infection. The duration of protection is unknown and may wane over time; this parameter will need to be addressed in a study with extended duration of follow up.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan real-world data be used to evaluate the comparative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for individuals who are antibody-positive versus antibody-negative?

FindingOf patients indexed on a positive antibody test, 10 of 3,226 with a NAAT (0.3%) had evidence of a positive NAAT > 90 days after index, compared with 491 of 16,157 (3.0%) indexed on a negative antibody test.

166,Public adherence to governmental recommendations regarding quarantine and testing for COVID-19 in two Norwegian cohorts,"BackgroundCombatting the COVID-19 pandemic relies at present on non-pharmacological interventions. Governments are using various approaches from general advice to full lockdown. There is a need to describe and understand adherence to public health actions.

MethodsParticipants from two ongoing cohorts, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and The Norwegian Influenza Pregnancy Cohort (NorFlu), answered questionnaires every 14 days since March 2020. From the summer of 2020, testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 became easily available. Recommendations were that respiratory symptoms should lead to testing, and that confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should be followed by quarantine. We estimated the adherence to these guidelines in responses from cohort participants in the period August to October 2020.

ResultsLess than 40% of men who were ill and less than 45% of women who were ill, tested themselves for SARS-CoV-2 during the same 14-day periods. Among subjects tested for COVID-19, about 53% of men and 59% of women reported quarantine. For subjects with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, the proportions quarantined were 65% for men and 72% for women.

ConclusionsPublic adherence to governmental recommendations regarding testing and quarantine were lower than expected in a country with high trust in government. This leaves considerable room for improvement in adherence, possibly reducing the need for more restrictive interventions.",Ellen Øen Carlsen; Ida Henriette Caspersen; Lill Trogstad; Håkon Gjessing; Per Magnus,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248405,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248405,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
167,An expedited approach towards the rationale design of non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors with in vitro antiviral activity,"The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target. Several Mpro inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity, including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, each containing a reactive warhead that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. In this study, we report an expedited drug discovery approach by coupling structure-based design and Ugi four-component (Ugi-4CR) reaction methodology to the design of non-covalent Mpro inhibitors. The most potent compound 23R had cellular antiviral activity similar to covalent inhibitors such as GC376. Our designs were guided by overlaying the structure of SARS-CoV Mpro + ML188 (R), a non-covalent inhibitor derived from Ug-4CR, with the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro + calpain inhibitor XII/GC376/UAWJ247. Binding site analysis suggests a strategy of extending the P2 and P3 substitutions in ML188 (R) to achieve optimal shape complementary with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Lead optimization led to the discovery of 23R, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with an IC50 of 0.31 M and EC50 of 1.27 M, respectively. The binding and specificity of 23R to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were confirmed in a thermal shift assay and native mass spectrometry assay. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R revealed the P2 biphenyl fits snuggly into the S2 pocket and the benzyl group in the -methylbenzyl faces towards the core of the enzyme, occupying a previously unexplored binding site located in between the S2 and S4 pockets. Overall, this study revealed the most potent non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors reported to date and a novel binding pocket that can be explored for Mpro inhibitor design.",Naoya Kitamura; Michael Dominic Sacco; Chunlong Ma; Yanmei Hu; Julia Townsend; Xiangzhi Meng; Fushun Zhang; Xiujun Zhang; Adis Kukuljac; Michael Marty; David Schultz; Sara Cherry; Yan Xiang; Yu Chen; Jun Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423537,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423537,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,False
168,"Mental health among pregnant women during the pandemic in Sweden, a mixed methods approach using data from the Mom2B mobile application for research","Public health emergencies such as the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have significant impact on mental health, and have been shown to impact on already prevalent affective disorders during and after pregnancy. The aim of this study was to utilize modern tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as wellbeing and life changes in pregnant women during the pandemic in Sweden, where no lockdown has been in place.

Data from the Mom2B, a national ongoing mobile application-based study of pregnant and newly-delivered women were utilized. Participants (n= 1345) filled out self-report screeners of depression, anxiety and wellbeing. Questions about COVID symptoms and effects on life and health care were added from March 2020. Movement data was collected using the phones GPS sensor. Mood scores were compared with throughout the months of 2020 and to the levels of a previous collected material. Highest levels of depression and anxiety were evident in April and October 2020. Symptoms were higher among those feeling socially isolated, but not for those infected or with symptomatic family members. Wellbeing and mobility were strongly positively correlated and were lowest in April. Women reported on cancelled healthcare appointments and worry about their partners being absent from the delivery.

The Mom2B application enabled gathering information at a national level in real-time as the pandemic has been evolving. Levels of perinatal affective symptoms and low wellbeing were elevated compared with previous years as well as with months with fewer cases of SARS-Cov-2. Similar applications can help healthcare providers and governmental bodies to in real time monitor high-risk groups during crises, as well as to adjust measures and the support offered.

Longitudinal analyses of more than 11,000 participants across the UK found no association between lower adherence to face covering guidelines and poorer mental health. The opposite appears to be true. Even after controlling for behavioral, social, and psychological confounds, including measures of pre-pandemic mental health, individuals who wore face coverings ""most of the time"" or ""always"" had better mental health and wellbeing than those who did not. These results suggest that wearing face coverings more often will not negatively impact mental health.",Drew M Altschul; Chloe Fawns-Ritchie; Alex Kwong; Louise Hartley; Clifford Nangle; Rachel Edwards; Rebecca Dawson; Christie Levein; Archie Campbell; Robin Flaig; Andrew McIntosh; Ian Deary; Riccardo Marioni; Caroline Hayward; Cathie Sudlow; Elaine Douglas; David Bell; David Porteous,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248477,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248477,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
170,The polybasic cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike modulates viral sensitivity to Type I IFN and IFITM2,"The cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses types 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2) requires sequential protease processing of the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 S at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation of the S precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to interferons, and more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is restricted predominantly by IFITM2 and the degree of this restriction is governed by route of viral entry. Removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-CoV-2 entry highly pH- and cathepsin-dependent in late endosomes where, like SARS-CoV-1 S, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we find that potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and transmission. This suggests therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I IFNs.

IMPORTANCEThe furin cleavage site in the S protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2 and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between individuals compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2, and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate immune restriction, and thus may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment development.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423592,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.19.423592,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,False
171,Sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters conferred by a novel recombinant subunit vaccine,"A safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential to avert the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we developed a subunit vaccine, which is comprised of CHO-expressed spike ectodomain protein (StriFK) and nitrogen bisphosphonates-modified zinc-aluminum hybrid adjuvant (FH002C). This vaccine candidate rapidly elicited the robust humoral response, Th1/Th2 balanced helper CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell immune response in animal models. In mice, hamsters, and non-human primates, 2-shot and 3-shot immunization of StriFK-FH002C generated 28- to 38-fold and 47- to 269-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers than the human COVID-19 convalescent plasmas, respectively. More importantly, the StriFK-FH002C immunization conferred sterilizing immunity to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which also protected animals from virus-induced weight loss, COVID-19-like symptoms, and pneumonia in hamsters. Vaccine-induced neutralizing and cell-based receptor-blocking antibody titers correlated well with protective efficacy in hamsters, suggesting vaccine-elicited protection is immune-associated.

172,A comprehensive transcriptome analysis reveals broader but weaker host response of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV,"COVID-19, which has resulted a worldwide health crisis with more than 74.9 million confirmed cases worldwide by December 2020, is caused by a newly emerging coronavirus identified and named SARS-CoV-2 in February in Wuhan, China. Experiences in defeating SARS, which infested during 2002-2003, can be used in treating the new disease. However, comparative genomics and epidemiology studies have shown much difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which underlies the different clinical features and therapies in between those two diseases. Further studies comparing transcriptomes infected by these two viruses to uncover the differences in host responses would be necessary. Here we conducted a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-infected human cell lines, including Caco-2, Calu-3, H1299. Clustering analysis and expression of ACE2 show that SARS-CoV-2 has broader but weaker infection, where the largest discrepancy occurs in the epithelial lung cancer cell, Calu-3. SARS-CoV-2 genes also show less tissue specificity than SARS-CoV genes. Furthermore, we detected more general but moderate immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected transcriptomes by comparing weighted gene co-expression networks and modules. Our results suggest a different immune therapy and treatment scheme for COVID-19 patients than the ones used on SARS patients.

173,The impact of the first UK Covid-19 lockdown on carers and people living with low prevalence dementia: results from the Rare Dementia Support survey,"IntroductionThe public health measures imposed to contain Covid-19 during the first UK lockdown resulted in significant changes in the provision of community support and care for people with dementia. People with low prevalence and young-onset dementias often experience non-memory, behavioural or neuropsychiatric symptoms that require specialised support.

ObjectiveWe explored the impact of the first Covid-19 lockdown on people living with low prevalence and young-onset dementia and their carers in the UK.

MethodAn online survey, including eleven questions about the impact of the lockdown on both the person with dementia and their family caregivers was conducted. Participants were people living with dementia and caregivers who are members of the UK national-reach organisation Rare Dementia Support.

Results184 carers and 24 people with dementia completed the survey. People with dementia experienced worsening of cognitive symptoms (70%), ability to do things (62%) and well-being (57%) according to their carers. Carers also reported a reduction in the support received for caring (55%). 93% of carers of people living in care homes reported a reduction in their ability to provide care. 26% of carers reported changes in the medication of the person with dementia during the lockdown. 74% of people with dementia reported decreased ability to connect with people socially.

ConclusionsPeople with dementia experienced a worsening of dementia symptoms, removal of support and increased difficulty to connect with other people socially during the 1st wave of Covid-19. Carers encountered barriers to both receiving and providing support and a decline in their own mental health and well-being.

Key pointsO_LI70 % of carers reported cognitive symptoms getting worse during the lockdown (e.g., the person with dementia being more disoriented and finding it more difficult to communicate).
C_LIO_LI26 % of carers reported a change (initiation or increase) in medication in the person with dementia during the lockdown.
C_LIO_LI79 % carers reported their own physical or mental health getting worse due to the lockdown. This increased to 93% when considering responses only from family carers of people living in care homes.
C_LIO_LI93 % of family carers of people living in care homes found it harder to continue providing care and support for their relative due to Covid-19.

To explore the potential relationship between virus-specific humoral responses and COVID-19 immunopathology, we measured serum antibody classes and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the nucleoprotein in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe disease. We found that RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG3 dominated the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, were more abundant in severe patients, and positively correlated with several clinical parameters of inflammation. In contrast, a virus-specific IgA2 response skewed toward RBD rather than NP associated with a more favorable clinical course.

177,Effects of obesity on serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in COVID-19 patients,"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2), cause of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease of 2019), represents a significant risk to people living with pre-existing conditions associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses and consequent dysfunctional immunity. In this paper, we have evaluated the effects of obesity, a condition associated with chronic systemic inflammation, on the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Results have shown that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are negatively associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in COVID-19 obese patients, as expected based on the known effects of obesity on humoral immunity. Antibodies in COVID-19 obese patients are also negatively associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers of inflammaging and pulmonary inflammation, such as SAA (serum amyloid A protein), CRP (C-reactive protein) and ferritin, but positively associated with NEFA (nonesterified fatty acids). These results altogether could help to identify an inflammatory signature with strong predictive value for immune dysfunction that could be targeted to improve humoral immunity in individuals with obesity as well as with other chronic inflammatory conditions.",Daniela Frasca; Lisa Reidy; Carolyn Cray; Alain Diaz; Maria Romero; Kristin Kahl; Bonnie B Blomberg,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248483,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248483,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
178,Forecasting daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Algeria using ARIMA models,"Coronavirus disease has become a worldwide threat affecting almost every country in the world. The aim of this study is to identify the COVID-19 cases (positive, recovery and death) in Algeria using the Double Exponential Smoothing Method and an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for forecasting the COVID-19 cases.

The data for this study were obtained from March 21st, 2020 to November 26th, 2020. The daily Algerian COVID-19 confirmed cases were sourced from The Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform of Algeria. Based on the results of PACF, ACF, and estimated parameters of the ARIMA model in the COVID-19 case in Algeria following the ARIMA model (0,1,1). Observed cases during the forecast period were accurately predicted and were placed within the prediction intervals generated by the fitted model. This study shows that ARIMA models with optimally selected covariates are useful tools for monitoring and predicting trends of COVID-19 cases in Algeria.",Abdelaziz MESSIS; Ahmed Adjebli; Riad Ayeche; Abderrezak Ghidouche; Djida Ait ali,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248340,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248340,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
179,Glycyrrhizin effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by inhibiting the viral main protease,"The newly emerged coronavirus, which was designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease. High effective and well-tolerated medication for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients is urgently needed. Traditional herbal medicine substances were discussed as promising candidates for the complementary treatment of viral diseases and recently suggested for the treatment of COVID-19. In the present study, we investigated aqueous licorice root extract for its neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, identified the active compound glycyrrhizin and uncovered the respective mechanism of viral neutralization. We demonstrated that glycyrrhizin, the primary active ingredient of the licorice root, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the viral main protease.

180,Common variants at 21q22.3 locus influence MX1 gene expression and susceptibility to severe COVID-19,"The COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-Cov-2, presents a heterogeneous clinical spectrum. The risk factors do not fully explain the wide spectrum of disease manifestations, so it is possible that genetic factors could account for novel insights into its pathogenesis.

In our previous study, we hypothesized that common variants on chromosome 21, near TMPRSS2 and MX1 genes, may be genetic risk factors associated to the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we performed an in-depth genetic analysis of chromosome 21 exploiting the genome-wide association study data including 6,406 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and 902,088 controls with European genetic ancestry from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We found that five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene show suggestive associations (P[&le;]1x10-5) with severe COVID-19. All five SNPs replicated the association in two independent cohorts of Asian subjects while two and one out of the 5 SNPs replicated in African and Italian populations, respectively (P[&le;]0.05). The minor alleles of these five SNPs correlated with a reduced risk of developing severe COVID-19 and increased level of MX1 expression in blood.

Our findings provide further evidence that host genetic factors can contribute to determine the different clinical presentations of COVID-19 and that MX1, an antiviral effector of type I and III interferon pathway, may be a potential therapeutic target.",Immacolata Andolfo; Roberta Russo; Alessandro Vito Lasorsa; Sueva Cantalupo; Barbara Eleni Rosato; Ferdinando Bonfiglio; Giulia Frisso; Pasquale Abete; Gian Marco Cassese; Giuseppe Servillo; Gabriella Esposito; Ivan Gentile; Carmelo Piscopo; Romolo Villani; Giuseppe Fiorentino; Pellegrino Cerino; Carlo Buonerba; Biancamaria Pierri; Massimo Zollo; Achille Iolascon; Mario Capasso,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248470,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248470,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True

However, data concerning the epidemiological features, viral shedding, and antibody dynamics between asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients remain controversial. We enrolled 193 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Ningbo and Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China from January 21 to March 6, 2020. All subjects were followed up to monitor the dynamics of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 31 were asymptomatic carriers, 149 were symptomatic patients, and 14 were presymptomatic patients. Compared to symptomatic patients, asymptomatic carriers were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower levels of C-reactive protein and viral load, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients (P=0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for IgG was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (P=0.037). Viral load was higher in symptomatic than presymptomatic patients. Viral shedding was longer in presymptomatic patients than in asymptomatic carriers. Conclusively, asymptomatic carriers have a higher antiviral immunity to clear SARS-CoV-2 than do symptomatic patients and this antiviral immunity is not contributable to humoral immunity.",Yi Chen; Ping Li; Yibo Ding; Miao Liu; Leijie Liu; Bo Yi; Ting Wu; Hongjun Dong; Xuying Lao; Keqing Ding; Haibo Wang; Dongliang Zhang; Xiaojie Tan; Zhongfa Wang; Guozhang Xu; Guangwen Cao,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248447,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248447,2020-12-20,2020-12-20,,True
182,Furin cleaves SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein at S1/S2 and S2'for viral fusion/entry: indirect role for TMPRSS2,"The Spike (S)-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds host-cell receptor ACE2 and requires proteolytic ""priming"" (S1/S2) and ""fusion-activation"" (S2) for viral entry. The S-protein furin-like motifs PRRAR685{downarrow} and KPSKR815{downarrow} indicated that proprotein convertases promote virus entry. We demonstrate that furin and PC5A induce cleavage at both sites, ACE2 enhances S2 processing, and their pharmacological inhibition (BOS-inhibitors) block endogenous cleavages. S1/S2-mutations (S1/S2) limit S-protein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion, similarly to BOS-inhibitors. Unexpectedly, TMPRSS2 does not cleave at S1/S2 or S2, but it can: (i) cleave/inactivate S-protein into S2a/S2b; (ii) shed ACE2; (iii) cleave S1-subunit into secreted S1, activities inhibited by Camostat. In lung-derived Calu-3 cells, BOS-inhibitors and {micro}S1/S2 severely curtail ""pH-independent"" viral entry, and BOS-inhibitors alone/with Camostat potently reduce infectious viral titer and cytopathic effects.

183,Identification of NPC1 as a novel SARS-CoV-2 intracellular target,"Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) receptor is an endosomal membrane protein that regulates intracellular cholesterol trafficking, which is crucial in the Ebola virus (EBOV) cycle. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the cell by binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the ACE2 receptor. This requires S-protein processing either by the surface transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 for plasma membrane fusion or cathepsin L for endosomal entry. Additional host factors are required for viral fusion at endosomes. Here, we report a novel interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) with the cholesterol transporter NPC1. Moreover, small molecules interfering with NPC1 that inhibit EBOV entry, also inhibited human coronavirus.

While great strides have been made toward understanding and combating the mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, relatively little is known about the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins that contribute to pathogenicity during infection and that cause neurological sequela after viral clearance. We used Drosophila to develop an in vivo model that characterizes mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, and found ORF3a adversely affects longevity and motor function by inducing apoptosis and inflammation in the nervous system. Chloroquine alleviated ORF3a induced phenotypes in the CNS, arguing our Drosophila model is amenable to high throughput drug screening.

Mutant peptides exhibited diminished or abrogated MHC-I binding, which was associated with a loss of recognition and functional responses by CD8+ T cells isolated from HLA-matched COVID-19 patients.

186,Fast and scalable lipid nanoparticle formulation of niclosamide (nano NCM) effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro,"As exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, highly infective respiratory viruses can spread rapidly in the population because of lack of effective approaches to control viral replication and spread. Niclosamide (NCM) is an old anthelminthic drug (World Health Organization essential medicine list) with pleiotropic pharmacological activities. Several recent publications demonstrated that NCM has broad antiviral activities and potently inhibits viral replication, including replication of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and dengue viruses. Unfortunately, NCM is almost completely insoluble in water, which limits its clinical use.

189,Genetic Conservation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Replication Complex in Globally Circulating Isolates from Humans and Minks Predicts Minimal Pre-Existing Resistance to Remdesivir,"Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, > 90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates and >300 from mink isolates collected through early September 2020 were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in [&ge;]0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates.

In addition, among the sequence variants observed in [&ge;]0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition.

190,Oxygen saturation instability in suspected covid-19 patients; contrasting effects of reduced VA/Q and shunt.,"Patients in the UK at risk of Covid-19 pneumonia, but not needing immediate hospital attention, are to be given pulse oximeters to identify at home deterioration in oxygen saturation (SaO2 or SpO2). A recent finding in Covid-19 pneumonia is a dominant reduction in VA/Q. A mathematical model of gas exchange was used to examine the effect of reduction of VA/Q or increase in shunt on SaO2 stability inferred from the slope of the PIO2 vs SaO2 curve as it intersects the line representing ambient PIO2. Reduced VA/Q predicted SpO2 instability breathing air, e.g. a {+/-}1 kPa change in PIO2 gave an 8% change in SpO2 at a VA/Q of 0.4 but a 1.5% change in SpO2 with a 15% shunt. As a consistency check, two patients with pre-existing lung disease and 12 hour continuous SpO2 monitoring breathing air had gas exchange impairment analysed in terms of shunt and reduced VA/Q. The patient with 16% shunt and normal VA/Q had a stable but reduced SpO2 (circa 93%) throughout the 12 hr period. The patient with a VA/Q reduced to 0.48 had SpO2 ranging from 75-95% during the same period. SpO2 monitoring in suspected covid-19 patients should focus on SpO2 varying >5% in 30 minutes. Such instability in at risk patients is not diagnostic of Covid -19 pneumonia but this may be suspected from a dominant reduction in VA/Q if episodic hypoxaemia has progressed from a stable SpO2.",John Gareth Jones; John Gareth Jones,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248126,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248126,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True

192,Risk Factors for SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity in a Health Care Worker Population,"BackgroundProtecting health care workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is essential. Serologic testing can identify HCWs who had minimally symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that were missed by occupational screening based on daily symptom and temperature checks. Recent studies report conflicting results regarding the impact of occupational factors on SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity amongst HCWs.

MethodsThe study population included all hospital workers at an academic medical center in Orange County, California. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed from a fingerstick blood specimen using a coronavirus antigen microarray, which compares IgM and IgG antibodies against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antigens with positive and negative controls to identify prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with 98% specificity and 93% sensitivity. Demographic, occupational, and clinical factors were surveyed and their effect on seropositivity estimated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.

ResultsAmongst 1,557 HCWs with complete data, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 10.8%. Risk factors for increased seropositivity included male gender, exposure to COVID-19 outside of work, working in food or environmental services, and working in COVID-19 units. Amongst the 1,103 HCW who were seropositive but missed by occupational screening, additional risk factors included younger age and working in administration.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is significantly higher than reported case counts even amongst HCWs who are meticulously screened. Seropositive HCWs missed by occupational screening were more likely to be younger, work roles without direct patient care, or have COVID-19 exposure outside of work.

We investigate immunological changes in convalescent COVID-19 and interrogate their potential relationships with persistent symptoms, termed long COVID.

We performed paired immunophenotyping at initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and convalescence (n=40, median 68 days) and validated findings in 71 further patients at median 101 days convalescence. Results were compared to 40 pre-pandemic controls. Fatigue and exercise tolerance were assessed and investigated their relationship with convalescent results.

We demonstrate persistent expansion of intermediate monocytes, effector CD8+, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and reduced naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 68 days, with activated CD8+ T cells remaining increased at 101 days. Patients >60 years also demonstrate reduced naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and expanded activated CD4+ T cells at 101 days. Ill-health, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance were common but were not associated with immunological changes.

194,Negative vaccine attitudes and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 in relation to smoking status: a population survey of UK adults,"IntroductionWe examined differences in negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 specifically, by smoking status in a large sample of adults in the UK.

MethodData were from 29,148 adults participating in the Covid-19 Social Study in September-October 2020. Linear regression analyses examined associations between smoking status (current/former/never) and four types of general negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between smoking status and uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosed health conditions.

ResultsRelative to never and former smokers, current smokers reported significantly greater mistrust of vaccine benefit, were more worried about unforeseen future effects, had greater concerns about commercial profiteering, and had a stronger preference for natural immunity (Badjs 0.16-0.36, p<0.001). Current smokers were more likely to be uncertain (27.6% vs. 22.7% of never smokers: RRadj 1.43 [95%CI 1.31-1.56]; vs. 19.3% of former smokers: RRadj 1.55 [1.41-1.73]) or unwilling (21.5% vs. 11.6% of never smokers: RRadj 2.12 [1.91-2.34]; vs. 14.7% of former smokers: RRadj 1.53 [1.37-1.71]) to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.

ConclusionsCurrent smokers hold more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and are more likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate against Covid-19, compared with never and former smokers. With a disproportionately high number of smokers belonging to socially clustered and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, lower vaccine uptake in this group could also exacerbate health inequalities.

195,Enhancing the estimation of compartmental model parameters for COVID-19 data with a high level of uncertainty,"Research on predictions related to the spread of the novel coronavirus are crucial in decision-making to mitigate the disease. Computational simulations are often used as a basis for forecasting the dynamics of epidemics and, for this purpose, compartmental models have been widely used to assess the situation resulting from the spread of the disease in the population. Reliable data is essential to obtain adequate simulations. However, several political, economic, and social factors have caused inconsistencies in the reported data, which are reflected in the capacity for realistic simulations and predictions. Such uncertainties are mainly motivated by a large-scale underreporting of cases due to the reduced testing capacity in some locations. In order to mitigate the effects of noise in the data used to estimate parameters of compartmental models, we propose strategies capable of improving the ability to predict the spread of the disease. We show that the regularization of data by means of Gaussian Process Regression can reduce the variability of successive forecasts, thus improving predictive ability. We also present the advantages of adopting parameters of compartmental models that vary over time, in detriment to the usual approach with constant values.",Gustavo B Libotte; Lucas Anjos; Regina C Almeida; Sandra M C Malta; Renato S Silva,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248389,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248389,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
196,Assessing Global Covid-19 Cases Data through Compositional Data Analysis(CoDa),"BackgroundCovid-19 cases data pose an enormous challenge to any analysis. The evaluation of such a global pandemic requires matching reports that follow different procedures and even overcoming some countries censorship that restricts publications.

MethodsThis work proposes a methodology that could assist future studies. Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) is proposed as the proper approach as Covid-19 cases data is compositional in nature. Under this methodology, for each country three attributes were selected: cumulative number of deaths (D); cumulative number of recovered patients(R); present number of patients (A).

ResultsAfter the operation called closure, with c=1, a ternary diagram and Log-Ratio plots, as well as, compositional statistics are presented. Cluster analysis is then applied, splitting the countries into discrete groups.

ConclusionsThis methodology can also be applied to other data sets such as countries, cities, provinces or districts in order to help authorities and governmental agencies to improve their actions to fight against a pandemic.",Luis Braga; Dina Feingenbaun,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248424,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248424,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
197,Blood group A Secretors are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 cardiovascular disease complications,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19, an infection capable of causing severe disease and death but which may also be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic in many individuals. While several risk factors, including age, have been described, the mechanisms of this variation are poorly understood. Several studies have described associations between blood group and COVID-19 severity, while others do not. Expression of ABO glycans on secreted proteins and non-erythroid cells is controlled by a fucosyltransferase (FUT2). Inactivating mutations result in a non-secretor phenotype which is known to protect against some viral infections. We investigated whether ABO or secretor status was associated with COVID-19 severity. Data combined from healthcare records and laboratory tests (n=275) of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients hospitalised with COVID-19, confirmed higher than expected numbers of blood group A individuals compared to O (RR=1.24, CI 95% [1.05,1.47], P=0.0111). There was also a significant association between group A and COVID-19-related cardiovascular complications (RR=2.56, CI 95% [1.43,4.55], P=0.0011) which is independent of gender. Molecular analysis of phenotype revealed that group A patients who are non-secretors are significantly less likely to be hospitalised than secretors. In a larger cohort of 1000 convalescent plasma donors, among whom the majority displayed COVID-19 symptoms and only a small minority required hospitalisation, group A non-secretors were slightly over-represented. Our findings indicate that group A non-secretors are not resistant to infection by SARS-CoV-2, but they are likely to experience a less severe form of its associated disease.

198,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, risk perception, behaviour, and preventive measures at schools in Berlin, Germany, during the early post-lockdown phase: A cross-sectional study","BackgroundBriefly before the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Berlin, Germany, schools closed in mid-March 2020 for six weeks. Following re-opening, schools gradually resumed operation at a reduced level for nine weeks preceding the summer holidays.

AimDuring this phase, we conducted a situational assessment in schools among students and teachers as to infection status, symptoms, affective, behavioural, educational issues, and preventive measures.

MethodsAt twenty-four randomly selected primary and secondary schools, one class each was examined. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household and schooling characteristics, leisure time activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, physical distancing, and facemask wearing were assessed.

ResultsAmong 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was SARS-CoV-2 infected (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%); 16% reported symptoms upon examination, and 48% in the preceding 14 days. Compared to before the pandemic, the proportion of leisure time spent as screen-time increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity. Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, but acceptance of adapted health behaviours was high. Governmental preventive measures were adequately implemented, with primary schools performing better than secondary schools.

ConclusionIn this phase of rare infection and low seroreactivity, individual and school-level infection prevention and control measures were largely adhered to. Nevertheless, vigilance, continued and proactive preventive measures, and well-rehearsed reaction options are essential to cope with increasing pandemic activity.",Franziska Hommes; Welmoed van Loon; Marlene Thielecke; Igor Abramovich; Sascha Lieber; Ralf Hammerich; Sabine Gehrke-Beck; Elisabeth Linzbach; Angela Schuster; Katja von dem Busche; Stefanie Theuring; Maximilian Gertler; Gabriela Equihua Martinez; Joachim Richter; Clara Bergmann; Alisa Bölke; Falko Böhringer; Marcus A.

199,CRISPR-cas13 enzymology rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 fragments in a clinical setting,"The well-recognized genome editing ability of the CRISPR-Cas system has triggered significant advances in CRISPR diagnostics. This has prompted an interest in developing new biosensing applications for nucleic acid detection. Recently, such applications have been engineered for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Increased demand for testing and consumables of RT-qPCR assays has led to the use of alternate testing options in some cases. Here we evaluate the accuracy and performance of a novel fluorescence based assay that received EUA authorization from the FDA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) technology forms the basis of the Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit using the CRISPR-Cas13a system. Our experimental strategy included selection of COVID-19 patient samples from previously validated RT-qPCR assays. Positive samples were selected based on a broad range of cycle thresholds. A total of 50 COVID-19 patient samples were correctly diagnosed with 100% accuracy (relative fluorescence ratios: N gene 95% CI 23.2-36.3, ORF1ab gene 95% CI 27.6-45.4). All controls, including RNase P, showed expected findings. Overall ratios were robustly distinct between positive and negative cases relative to the pre-established 5-fold change in fluorescence read output. We have evaluated the accuracy of detecting conserved targets of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of viral loads using the SHERLOCK CRISPR collateral detection reaction in a clinical setting. These findings demonstrate encouraging results, especially at a time when COVID-19 clinical diagnosis is in high demand; often with limited resources. This approach highlights new thinking in infectious disease identification and can be expanded to measure nucleic acids in other clinical isolates.",Wahab A. Khan; Rachael E.

200,Detection of SARS-CoV2 antigen in human saliva may be a reliable tool for large scale screening,"IntroductionSARS-CoV2, the aetiological agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, has been detected in saliva and recently implicated in several oral diseases. Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) requires medical / technical expertise. A reliable and easy to handle point-of-care (POC) test is highly desirable, especially to curb transmission. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated a commercially available POC rapid antigen test (RAT) for the detection of SARS-CoV2 antigens in the saliva of RT-PCR confirmed positive and negative patients.

MethodsThirty saliva samples of 10 saliva RT-PCR negative and 20 saliva RT-PCR positive patients were tested by RAT.

ResultsRAT was negative in 10/10 (100%) RT-PCR-negative samples; positive in 9/20 (45%) RT-PCR-positive samples; concordance was 63% (p=0.001). Patients with positive RAT had higher virus copies in their NPS samples compared to the RAT-negative patients. This difference was also statistically significant (p=0.01).

ConclusionThus, the POC RAT may be used to detect SARS-CoV2 as a reliable tool for self-testing, large-scale population screening and emergency medical/dental screening.

201,Current evidence for COVID-19 therapies: a systematic literature review,"Effective therapeutic interventions for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 are urgently needed. A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 published between 1 December 2019 and 14 October 2020. Data regarding efficacy of interventions, in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation, were extracted from identified studies and synthesised qualitatively.

In total, 42 clinical trials were included. Interventions assessed included antiviral, mucolytic, anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Some reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation were seen with interferons and remdesivir, particularly when administered early, and with the mucolytic drug, bromhexine. Most studies of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine did not show significant efficacy over standard care/placebo. Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation versus standard care, particularly in patients with severe disease. Evidence for other classes of interventions was limited. Many trials had a moderate-to-high risk of bias, particularly in terms of blinding; most were short-term; and some included low patient numbers.

This review highlights the need for well-designed clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 to increase the quality of available evidence.

203,Excess deaths among Latino people in California during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BackgroundLatinos in the US are experiencing higher excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic than any other racial/ethnic group, but it is unclear which subgroups within this diverse population are most affected. Such information is necessary to target policies and programs that prevent further excess mortality and reduce inequities.

MethodsUsing death certificate data for January 1, 2016 through February 29, 2020 and time-series models, we estimated the expected weekly deaths among Latinos in California from March 1 through October 3, 2020. We quantified excess mortality as observed minus expected deaths and risk ratios (RR) as the ratio of observed to expected deaths. We considered subgroups defined by age, sex, place of birth, education, occupation, and combinations of these factors.

ResultsDuring the first seven months of the pandemic, Latino deaths in California exceeded expected deaths by 10,304, a 31% increase. Excess death rates were greatest for individuals born in Mexico (RR 1.44; 95% PI, 1.41, 1.48) or Central America (RR 1.49; 95% PI, 1.37, 1.63), with less than a high school degree (RR 1.41; 95% PI, 1.35, 1.46), or in manufacturing (RR 1.62; 95% PI, 1.52, 1.72) or food-and-agriculture occupations (RR 1.50; 95% PI, 1.40, 1.61). Disparities in excess death by place of birth and education were magnified among Latinos in essential occupations.

ConclusionsForeign-birth, low formal education, and work in an essential sector put some Latinos in California at higher risk of death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should reduce the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Latino immigrants and Latinos in unsafe working conditions; these may include early vaccination, workplace safety enforcement, and expanded access to medical care.",Alicia R.

From the study subjects (N = 258) retrospectively enrolled when confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive, nasopharyngeal (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), and sputum specimens were restored for retesting SARS-CoV-2 and detecting respiratory pathogens. Majority of the study subjects (95.7%, N = 247) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive using NPS/OPS specimens, suggesting that the upper respiratory specimen is most valuable in detecting SARS-CoV-2. Coinfection rates in COVID-19 patients (N = 258) with respiratory pathogens were 9.7% (N = 25); 8.5% (N = 22) respiratory viruses and 1.2% (N = 3) Mycoplasma pneumoniae, an atypical bacterium. Of the respiratory virus coinfection cases (N = 22), 20 (90.9%) were co-infected with a single respiratory virus and 2 (0.8%) (metapneumovirus/adenovirus and rhinovirus/bocavirus 1/2/3/4) with two viruses. Respiratory viruses in single viral coinfection cases with SARS-CoV-2 were as follows: non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (229E, NL63, and OC43, N = 5, 1.9%), rhinovirus (N = 4, 1.6%), metapneumovirus (N = 3, 1.2%), influenza A (N = 3, 1.2%), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (N = 3, 1.2%), and adenovirus (N = 2, 0.8%). No mixed coinfections with respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae were found.

MethodsData were collated by the hospital epidemiological service for patients admitted from 3/7/2020-9/1/2020. Time until final discharge or death was the outcome. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate time until death among admitted patients.

FindingsIn total, 99.06% of cases had resolved leading to 1,179 discharges and 211 deaths. Length of stay was significantly longer in those who died as compared to those who did not p=0.007). Of patients who had been discharged (n=1,179), 54 were readmitted and 9 subsequently died. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that in addition to older age, male sex, and heart failure, a history of premorbid depression was a risk factor for COVI-19 mortality.

206,Risk of thrombotic complications in influenza versus COVID-19 hospitalized patients,"BackgroundWhereas accumulating studies on COVID-19 patients report high incidences of thrombotic complications, large studies on clinically relevant thrombosis in patients with other respiratory tract infections are lacking. How this high risk in COVID-19 patients compares to those observed in hospitalized patients with other viral pneumonias such as influenza is unknown.

ObjectivesTo assess the incidence of venous and arterial thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients as opposed to that observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsRetrospective cohort study; we used data from Statistics Netherlands (study period: 2018) on thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients. In parallel, we assessed the cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications - adjusted for competing risk of death - in patients with COVID-19 in three Dutch hospitals (February 24th - April 26th 2020).

ResultsOf the 13.217 hospitalized influenza patients, 437 (3.3%) were diagnosed with thrombotic complications, versus 66 (11%) of the 579 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The 30-day cumulative incidence of any thrombotic complication in influenza was 11% (95%CI 9.4-12) versus 25% (95%CI 18-32) in COVID-19. For venous thrombotic complications (VTE) and arterial thrombotic complications alone, these numbers were respectively 3.6% (95%CI 2.7-4.6) and 7.5% (95%CI 6.3-8.8) in influenza versus 23% (95%CI 16-29) and 4.4% (95%CI 1.9-8.8) in COVID-19.

ConclusionsThe incidence of thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients was lower than in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This difference was mainly driven by a high risk of VTE complications in the COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. Remarkably, influenza patients were more often diagnosed with arterial thrombotic complications.

Arterial stiffness due to Endothelial Dysfunction has been established as an independent and specific marker of various chronic cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveOur objective was to examine functional impairment of the arteries in COVID-19 disease and establish the non-invasive measurement of Arterial Stiffness as an independent marker of disease severity.

MethodsWe recorded the Arterial Stiffness of 23 Mild, 21 Moderate and 20 Severe COVID-19 patients grouped on latest NIH severity criteria. We observed Arterial Stiffness of COVID-19 patients with standard parameters like non-invasive Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave velocity (cfPWV), Age-Normalized increase in cfPWV (ANI_cfPWV).

ResultsModerate and Severe COVID-19 patients have extremely elevated arterial stiffness than Mild patients. In Mild patients, cfPWV (829.1 {+/-} 139.2 cm/s) was extremely significantly lower than both Moderate (1067 {+/-} 152.5 cm/s, P< 0.0001) and Severe (1416 {+/-} 253.9 cm/s, P < 0.0001) patients.

208,Lessons learned from Vietnam's COVID-19 response: the role of adaptive behavior change and testing in epidemic control,"BackgroundVietnam has emerged as one of the worlds leading success stories in responding to COVID-19. After prolonged zero-low transmission, a summer outbreak of unknown source at Da Nang caused the countrys first COVID-19 deaths, but was quickly suppressed. Vietnam recently reopened its borders to international travelers. Understanding the attendant risks and how to minimize them is crucial as Vietnam moves into this new phase.

MethodsWe create an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Vietnam, using regional testing data and a detailed linelist of the 1,014 COVID-19 cases, including 35 deaths, identified across Vietnam. We investigate the Da Nang outbreak, and quantify the risk of another outbreak under different assumptions about behavioral/policy responses and ongoing testing.

ResultsThe Da Nang outbreak, although rapidly contained once detected, nevertheless caused significant community transmission before it was detected; higher symptomatic testing could have mitigated this. If testing levels do not increase, the adoption of past policies in response to newly-detected cases may reduce the size of potential outbreaks but will not prevent them. Compared to a baseline symptomatic testing rate of 10%, we estimate half as many infections under a 20% testing rate, and a quarter as many with 40-50% testing rates, over the four months following border reopenings.

ConclusionsVietnams success in controlling COVID-19 is largely attributable to its rapid response to detected outbreaks, but the speed of response could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing.",Quang D Pham; Robyn Margaret Stuart; Thuong V Nguyen; Quang C Luong; Dai Q Tran; Thai Q Pham; Lan T Phan; Tan Q Dang; Duong N Tran; Hung T Do; Dina Mistry; Daniel J Klein; Romesh G Abeysuriya; Assaf P Oron; Cliff C Kerr,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248454,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248454,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True

The aim of this study is to conduct in silico population dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 90% inhibition (EC90) of SARS-Cov-2 as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells.

MethodsPopulation pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for a structural one-compartment model with first-order absorption was used to simulate fluoxetine concentration-time data. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine doses (20mg/day, 40mg/day, and 60mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough level for the EC90 SARS-Cov-2 inhibitory concentration at each day throughout a 10-day treatment period. All analyses were conducted via statistical programming in R.

ResultsStandard fluoxetine antidepressant doses resulted in a range of 79% to 97% of the patient population achieving a trough target plasma concentration of 25.1 ng/ml which translates to lung-tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher (EC90 of 4.02 M). At a dose of 40mg per day, at least 85% of patients will reach the trough target EC90 concentration within 3-days.

We define the status of outbreak in each country by the sign and the deviation from zero of the rate and show that the infection status of each country can be completely classified into nine different states.,Takashi Odagaki; Reiji Suda,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248445,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248445,2020-12-19,2020-12-19,,True
211,Household bubbles and COVID-19 transmission: insights from percolation theory,"BackgroundIn the era of social distancing to curb the spread of COVID-19, bubbling is the combining of two or more households to create an exclusive larger group. The impact of bubbling on COVID-19 transmission is challenging to quantify because of the complex social structures involved.

MethodsWe developed a network description of households in the UK, using the configuration model to link households. We explored the impact of bubbling scenarios by joining together households of various sizes. For each bubbling scenario, we calculated the percolation threshold, that is, the number of connections per individual required for a giant component to form, numerically and theoretically. We related the percolation threshold to the household reproduction number.

ResultsWe find that bubbling scenarios in which single-person households join with another household has a minimal impact on network connectivity and transmission potential. Ubiquitous scenarios where all households form a bubble are likely to lead to extensive transmission that is hard to control. The impact of plausible scenarios, with variable uptake and heterogeneous bubble sizes, can be mitigated with reduced numbers of contacts outside the household.

ConclusionsBubbling of households comes at an increased risk of transmission, however under certain circumstances risks can be modest and could be balanced by other changes in behaviours.",Leon Danon; Lucas Lacasa; Ellen Brooks-Pollock,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248311,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248311,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
212,The Persistence of Vaccine Hesitancy: COVID-19 Vaccination Intention,"Building public trust and willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 is as important as developing an effective vaccine. However, a significant minority of the public are unwilling or hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine, when available. A nationally representative sample survey (N=1040) was conducted in July 2020 in New Zealand to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention. Trust in experts and general vaccine hesitancy were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention.

213,"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, risk factors for infection and associated symptoms in Geneva, Switzerland: a population-based study","BackgroundPopulation-based serological surveys provide a means for assessing the immunologic landscape of a community, without the biases related to health-seeking behaviors and testing practices typically associated with rt-PCR testing. This study assesses SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over the first epidemic wave in Canton Geneva, Switzerland, as well as biological and socio-economic risk factors for infection and symptoms associated with IgG seropositivity.

Methods and findingsBetween April 6 and June 30, 2020, former participants of a yearly representative cross-sectional survey of the 20-75-year-old population of the canton of Geneva were invited to participate in a seroprevalence study, along with household members five years and older. We collected blood and tested it for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G (IgG). Questionnaires were self-administered. We estimated seroprevalence with a Bayesian model accounting for test performance and sampling design. We included 8344 participants (53.5% women, mean age 46.9 years). The population-level seroprevalence over the 12-week study period was 7.8 % (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 6.8-8.9), accounting for sex, age and household random effects. Seroprevalence was highest among 18-49 year olds (9.5%, 95%CrI 8.1-10.9), with young children (5-9 years) and those >65 years having significantly lower seroprevalence (4.3% and 4.7-5.4% respectively). Men were more likely to be seropositive than women (relative risk 1.2, 95%CrI 1.1-1.4). Odds of seropositivity were reduced for female retirees (0.46, 95%CI 0.23-0.93) and unemployed men (0.35, 95%CI 0.13-1.0) compared to employed individuals, and for current smokers (0.36, 95%CI 0.23-0.55) compared to never-smokers. We found no significant association between occupation, level of education, neighborhood income and the risk of being seropositive. Symptoms most strongly associated with seropositivity were anosmia/dysgeusia, loss of appetite, fever, fatigue and myalgia and/or arthralgia. Thirteen percent of seropositive participants reported no symptoms.

ConclusionsOur results confirm a low population seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after the first wave in Geneva, a region hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic factors were not associated with seropositivity in this sample. The elderly and young children were less frequently seropositive, though it is not clear how biology and behaviors shape these differences. These specificities should be considered when assessing the need for targeted public health measures.",Aude Richard; Ania Wisniak; Javier Perez-Saez; Henri Garrison-Desany; Dusan Petrovic; Giovanni Piumatti; Helene Baysson; Attilio Picazio; Francesco Pennacchio; David De Ridder; Francois Chappuis; Nicolas Vuilleumier; Nicola Low; Samia Hurst; Isabella Eckerle; Antoine Flahault; Laurent Kaiser; Anderw S Azman; Idris Guessous; Silvia Stringhini; - SEROCOV-POP study group,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248180,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248180,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
214,No evidence of association between schools and SARS-CoV-2 second wave in Italy.,"During Covid-19 pandemic, school closure has been mandated in analogy to its known effect against influenza, but it is unclear whether schools are early amplifiers of Covid19 cases. By analyzing the case scenario of school reopening across the twenty-one Italian regions, we did not find evidence that schools drove the second SARS-CoV-2 wave. Indeed, from September 12 to November 7 2020, SARS-CoV-2 incidence among students was lower than that in the general population of all but two Italian regions. From August 28 to October 25 in Veneto where school reopened on September 14, the growth of SARS-CoV-2 incidence measured across all age groups was lower in school age individuals, maximal in 20-29 and 45-49 years old individuals. Moreover, the increase in Covid19 reproduction number Rt was not associated with the different school opening dates. Reciprocally, school closures in two regions where they were implemented before other measures did not affect the rate of Rt decline. In schools, despite the high frequency of tests per week, secondary infections were <1%, and clusters in a representative November week infrequent. Thus, our prospective analysis does not support a role for school reopening as a driver of the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in Italy.",Sara Gandini; Maurizio Rainisio; Maria Luisa Iannuzzo; Federica Bellerba; Francesco Cecconi; Luca Scorrano,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248134,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248134,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
215,International Comparisons of Harmonized Laboratory Value Trajectories to Predict Severe COVID-19: Leveraging the 4CE Collaborative Across 342 Hospitals and 6 Countries: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"ObjectivesTo perform an international comparison of the trajectory of laboratory values among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who develop severe disease and identify optimal timing of laboratory value collection to predict severity across hospitals and regions.

DesignRetrospective cohort study.

SettingThe Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE), an international multi-site data-sharing collaborative of 342 hospitals in the US and in Europe.

ParticipantsPatients hospitalized with COVID-19, admitted before or after PCR-confirmed result for SARS-CoV-2.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresPatients were categorized as ""ever-severe"" or ""never-severe"" using the validated 4CE severity criteria. Eighteen laboratory tests associated with poor COVID-19-related outcomes were evaluated for predictive accuracy by area under the curve (AUC), compared between the severity categories. Subgroup analysis was performed to validate a subset of laboratory values as predictive of severity against a published algorithm. A subset of laboratory values (CRP, albumin, LDH, neutrophil count, D-dimer, and procalcitonin) was compared between North American and European sites for severity prediction.

ResultsOf 36,447 patients with COVID-19, 19,953 (43.7%) were categorized as ever-severe. Most patients (78.7%) were 50 years of age or older and male (60.5%). Longitudinal trajectories of CRP, albumin, LDH, neutrophil count, D-dimer, and procalcitonin showed association with disease severity. Significant differences of laboratory values at admission were found between the two groups. With the exception of D-dimer, predictive discrimination of laboratory values did not improve after admission. Sub-group analysis using age, D-dimer, CRP, and lymphocyte count as predictive of severity at admission showed similar discrimination to a published algorithm (AUC=0.88 and 0.91, respectively). Both models deteriorated in predictive accuracy as the disease progressed. On average, no difference in severity prediction was found between North American and European sites.

ConclusionsLaboratory test values at admission can be used to predict severity in patients with COVID-19. There is a need for prediction models that will perform well over the course of the disease in hospitalized patients.",Griffin M Weber; Chuan Hong; Nathan P Palmer; Paul Avillach; Shawn N Murphy; Alba Gutiérrez-Sacristán; Zongqi Xia; Arnaud Serret-Larmande; Antoine Neuraz; Gilbert S.

216,A recombinant fragment of Human surfactant protein D binds Spike protein and inhibits infectivity and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples,"RationaleCOVID-19 is an acute infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human surfactant protein D (SP-D) is known to interact with spike protein of SARS-CoV, but its immune-surveillance against SARS-CoV-2 is not known.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine the potential of a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) as an inhibitor of replication and infection of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsrfhSP-D interaction with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hACE-2 receptor was predicted via docking analysis. The inhibition of interaction between spike protein and ACE-2 by rfhSP-D was confirmed using direct and indirect ELISA. The effect of rfhSP-D on replication and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples was studied by measuring the expression of RdRp gene of the virus using qPCR.

Measurements and Main ResultsIn-silico interaction studies indicated that three amino acid residues in the RBD of spike of SARS-CoV-2 were commonly involved in interacting with rfhSP-D and ACE-2. Studies using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (asymptomatic, n=7 and symptomatic, n=8 and negative controls n=15) demonstrated that treatment with 5M rfhSP-D inhibited viral replication by ~5.5 fold and was more efficient than Remdesivir (100 M). Approximately, a 2-fold reduction in viral infectivity was also observed after treatment with 5M rfhSP-D.

ConclusionsThese results conclusively demonstrate that the calcium independent rfhSP-D mediated inhibition of binding between the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE-2, its host cell receptor, and a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in-vitro.",Taruna Madan; Barnali Biswas; Praveen Varghese; Rambhadur Subedi; Hrishikesh Pandit; Susan Idicula-Thomas; Indra Kundu; Sheetalnath Babasaheb Rooge; Reshu Aggarwal; Dinesh Tripathi; Savneet Kaur; Ekta Gupta; Sanjeev Gupta,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423415,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423415,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,False
217,A new concept on anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: strong CD8+ T-cell immune response in both spleen and lung induced in mice by endogenously engineered extracellular vesicles,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 is spreading rapidly in the absence of validated tools to control the growing epidemic besides social distancing and masks. Many efforts are ongoing for the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 since there is an imminent need to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread. Essentially all vaccines in most advanced phases are based on the induction of antibody response against either whole or part of spike (S) protein. Differently, we developed an original strategy to induce CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). We exploited this technology with the aim to identify a clinical candidate defined as DNA vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 antigens inducing a robust CD8+ T-cell response. This is a new vaccination approach employing a DNA expression vector encoding a biologically inactive HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) showing an unusually high efficiency of incorporation into EVs even when foreign polypeptides are fused to its C-terminus. Nanovesicles containing Nefmut-fused antigens released by muscle cells are internalized by antigen-presenting cells leading to cross-presentation of the associated antigens thereby priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. To apply this technology to a design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we recovered DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and four viral antigens, namely N- and C-terminal moieties of S (referred to as S1 and S2), M, and N. All fusion products are efficiently uploaded in EVs. When the respective DNA vectors were injected in mice, a strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity was generated. Most important, high levels of virus-specific CD8+ T cells were found in bronchoalveolar lavages of immunized mice. Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing the diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens resulted in additive immune responses in both spleen and lung. EVs engineered with SARS-CoV-2 antigens proved immunogenic also in the human system through cross-priming assays carried out with ex vivo human cells. Hence, DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins can be proposed as anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.",Flavia Ferrantelli; Chiara Chiozzini; Francesco Manfredi; Patrizia Leone; Maurizio Federico,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423420,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423420,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,False
218,Human Surfactant Protein D Binds S1 and Receptor Binding Domain of Spike protein and acts as an entry inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Pseudotyped viral particles in vitro,"Human SP-D is a potent innate immune molecule whose presence at pulmonary mucosal surfaces allows immune surveillance role against pulmonary pathogens. Higher levels of serum SP-D have been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV). Studies have suggested the ability of human SP-D to recognise spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV; its interaction with HCoV-229E strain leads to viral inhibition in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Previous studies have reported that a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) composed of 8 Gly-X-Y repeats, neck and CRD region, can act against a range of viral pathogens including influenza A Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo models. In this context, this study was aimed at examining the likely protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection. rfhSP-D showed a dose-responsive binding to S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor binding domain. Importantly, rfhSP-D inhibited interaction of S1 protein with the HEK293T cells overexpressing Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2. The protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an entry inhibitor was further validated by the use of pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein; ~0.5 RLU fold reduction in viral entry was seen following rfhSP-D treatment (10 g/ml).

219,An infectivity-enhancing site on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is targeted by COVID-19 patient antibodies,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes severe symptoms in a subset of patients, suggesting the presence of certain unknown risk factors. Although antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike have been shown prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) dramatically enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2, and thus increased SARS-CoV2 infectivity. Surprisingly, mutational analysis revealed that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the surface of the NTD. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected in all samples of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the study. However, the ratio of infectivity-enhancing antibodies to neutralizing antibodies differed among patients. Furthermore, the antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site were detected in 3 out of 48 uninfected donors, albeit at low levels. These findings suggest that the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity-enhancing site could be considered as a possible exacerbating factors for COVID-19 and that a spike protein lacking such antibody epitopes may be required for safe vaccine development, especially for individuals with pre-existing enhancing antibodies.",Yafei Liu; Wai Tuck Soh; Asa Tada; Akemi Arakawa; Sumiko Matsuoka; Emi E Nakayama; Songling Li; Chikako Ono; Shiho Torii; Kazuki Kishida; Hui Jin; Wataru Nakai; Noriko Arase; Atsushi Nakagawa; Yasuhiro Shindo; Masako Kohyama; Hironori Nakagami; Keisuke Tomii; Koichiro Ohmura; Shiro Ohshima; Masato Okada; Yoshiharu Matsuura; Daron M Standley; Tatsuo Shioda; Hisashi Arase,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423358,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.423358,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,False

Human SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been characterised as an acute respiratory illness, with most patients displaying flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and dyspnoea. However, the range and severity of individual symptoms experienced by patients can vary significantly, indicating a role for host genetics in impacting the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 disease. Whilst most symptomatic infections are known to manifest in mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, severe pneumonia and complications including cytokine release syndrome, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, have also been observed in cases worldwide. Global initiatives to sequence the genomes of patients with COVID-19 have driven an expanding new field of host genomics research, to characterise the genetic determinants of COVID-19 disease. The functional annotation and analysis of incoming genomic data, within a clinically relevant turnaround time, is therefore imperative given the importance and urgency of research efforts to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.

Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell immune profiling of 64 COVID-19 patients across the full range of disease severity, from outpatients with mild disease to fatal cases. Our transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses reveal widespread dysfunction of peripheral innate immunity in severe and fatal COVID-19, with the most profound disturbances including a prominent neutrophil hyperactivation signature and monocytes with anti-inflammatory features. We further demonstrate that emergency myelopoiesis is a prominent feature of fatal COVID-19.

It is unknown how SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral sepsis in human. We recently found that SARS-CoV-2 provoked an anti-bacterial like response and activation of TLR4 pathway at the very early stage of infection in animal models. This abnormal immune response led to emergency granulopoiesis and sepsis. However, the original trigger of TLR4 signaling by SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. We here identified that the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 could bind to TLR4 directly and robustly activate downstream signaling in monocytes and neutrophils. Moreover, specific TLR4 or NFKB inhibitor, or knockout of MyD88 could significantly block IL-1B induction by spike protein.

225,A human coronavirus evolves antigenically to escape antibody immunity,"There is intense interest in antibody immunity to coronaviruses. However, it is unknown if coronaviruses evolve to escape such immunity, and if so, how rapidly. Here we address this question by characterizing the historical evolution of human coronavirus 229E. We identify human sera from the 1980s and 1990s that have neutralizing titers against contemporaneous 229E that are comparable to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We test these sera against 229E strains isolated after sera collection, and find that neutralizing titers are lower against these ""future"" viruses. In some cases, sera that neutralize contemporaneous 229E viral strains with titers >1:100 do not detectably neutralize strains isolated 8-17 years later. The decreased neutralization of ""future"" viruses is due to antigenic evolution of the viral spike, especially in the receptor-binding domain.

226,"Genomic and phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in the city of Gwangju, South Korea","Since the first identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in late December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread fast around the world. RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have higher gene mutations than DNA viruses during virus replication. Variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome could contribute to efficiency of viral spread and severity of COVID-19. In this study, we analyzed the locations of genomic mutations to investigate the genetic diversity among isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in Gwangju.

227,Fundamental Limitations of Contact Tracing for COVID-19,"Contact tracing has played a central role in COVID-19 control in many jurisdictions and is often used in conjunction with other measures such as travel restrictions and social distancing mandates. Contact tracing is made ineffective, however, by delays in testing, calling, and isolating. Even if delays are minimized, contact tracing can only prevent a fraction of onward transmissions from contacts. Without other measures in place, contact tracing alone is insufficient to prevent exponential growth in the number of cases. Even when used effectively with other measures, occasional bursts in call loads can overwhelm contact tracing systems and lead to a loss of control. We propose embracing approaches to COVID-19 control that broadly test individuals without symptoms, in whatever way is economically feasible - either with fast cheap tests that can be deployed widely, with pooled testing, or with screening of judiciously chosen groups of high-risk individuals. Only by ramping up testing of asymptomatic individuals can we avoid the inherent delays that limit the efficacy of contact tracing.",Paul F Tupper; Sarah Otto; Caroline Colijn,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248299,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248299,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
228,"Modelling of COVID-19 vaccination strategies and herd immunity, in scenarios of limited and full vaccine supply in NSW, Australia.","Several vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be available in Australia in 2021. Initial supply is likely to be limited, and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile of 1 million doses in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control. Slower rates of vaccination will result in the population living with COVID-19 longer, and higher cases and deaths.",Chandini Raina MacIntyre; Valentina Costantino; Mallory J Trent,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248278,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248278,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True

230,SARS-CoV-2 shifting transmission dynamics and hidden reservoirs limited the efficacy of public health interventions in Italy,"We investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Italy, one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, using phylodynamic analysis of viral genetic and epidemiological data. We observed the co-circulation of at least 13 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages over time, which were linked to multiple importations and characterized by large transmission clusters concomitant with a high number of infections. Subsequent implementation of a three-phase nationwide lockdown strategy greatly reduced infection numbers and hospitalizations. Yet we present evidence of sustained viral spread among sporadic clusters acting as ""hidden reservoirs"" during summer 2020. Mathematical modelling shows that increased mobility among residents eventually catalyzed the coalescence of such clusters, thus driving up the number of infections and initiating a new epidemic wave. Our results suggest that the efficacy of public health interventions is, ultimately, limited by the size and structure of epidemic reservoirs, which may warrant prioritization during vaccine deployment.",Marta Giovanetti; Eleonora Cella; Francesca Benedetti; Brittany Rife Magalis; Vagner Fonseca; Silvia Fabris; Giovanni Campisi; Alessandra Ciccozzi; Silvia Angeletti; Alessandra Borsetti; Vittoradolfo Tambone; Caterina Sagnelli; Stefano Pascarella; Alberto Riva; Giancarlo Ceccarelli; Alessandro Marcello; Taj Azarian; Eduan Wilkinson; Tulio de Oliveira; Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara; Roberto Cauda; Arnaldo Caruso; Natalie E Dean; Cameron Browne; Jose Lourenco; Marco Salemi; Davide Zella; Massimo Ciccozzi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248355,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248355,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
231,SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with higher nasopharyngeal viral load is strongly associated with severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19,"ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum and its association with the clinical severity of COVID-19.

MethodsAn analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single tertiary care hospital and included consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables, including required oxygen supplementation, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality, were examined.

ResultsFifty-six patients were included in the study. The median age was 54.5 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those without detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (78 vs. 50 years; P = .0013). RNAemia was detected in 19.6% of patients (11/56) and in 1.0% (1/25), 50.0% (6/12), and 100.0% (4/4) of moderate, severe, and critically ill cases, respectively. Patients with RNAemia required more frequent oxygen supplementation (90.0% vs. 13.3%; P < .0001) and ICU admission (81.8% vs. 6.7%; P < .0001) and required invasive mechanical ventilation (27.3% vs. 0.0%; P < .0001). Among patients with RNAemia, the median viral loads of NP swabs that were collected around the same time as the serum were significantly higher in critically ill cases (5.4 Log10 copies/L [IQR: 4.2-6.3]) than in moderate-severe cases (2.6 Log10 copies/L [1.1-4.5]; P =.030) and were significantly higher in nonsurvivor cases (6.2 Log10 copies/L [IQR: 6.0-6.5]) than in survivor cases (3.9 Log10 copies/L [1.6-4.6]; P =.045).

ConclusionsThis study demonstrated a relatively high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity. Moreover, among the patients with RNAemia, the viral loads of NP swabs were correlated with severity and mortality, thus suggesting the potential utility of combining serum testing with NP tests as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19 with a higher quality than each separate test.",Hitoshi Kawasuji; Yoshitomo Morinaga; Hideki Tani; Yoshihiro Yoshida; Yusuke Takegoshi; Makito Kaneda; Yushi Murai; Kou Kimoto; Akitoshi Ueno; Yuki Miyajima; Koyomi Kawago; Yasutaka Fukui; Miyuki Kimura; Hiroshi Yamada; Ippei Sakamaki; Yoshihiro Yamamoto,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248388,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248388,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
232,"Association of working shifts, inside and outside of healthcare, with risk of severe COVID-19: An observational study","BackgroundHealth and key workers are at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; it is not known, however, if this risk is exacerbated in those with irregular work patterns. We aimed to investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers.

MethodsWe included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline and with linked COVID-19 data to 31st August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker nor shift worker (reference category), health worker only, shift worker only, or both and associations with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions.

FindingsOf 235,685 participants (81{middle dot}5% neither health nor shift worker, 1{middle dot}4% health worker only, 16{middle dot}9% shift worker only, and 0{middle dot}3% both), there were 580 (0{middle dot}25%) cases of severe COVID-19. The risk of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 2.32 [95% CI: 1{middle dot}33, 4{middle dot}05]; shift workers (2{middle dot}06 [1{middle dot}72, 2{middle dot}47]); and in health workers who worked shifts (7{middle dot}56 [3{middle dot}86, 14{middle dot}79]). Being both a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the risk severe COVID-19 in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals.

InterpretationBoth health and shift work were independently associated with over twice the risk of severe COVID-19; the risk was over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts. Vaccinations, therapeutic and preventative options should take into consideration not only health and key worker status but also shift worker status.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe risk of developing severe COVID-19 is greater in occupational groups with higher levels of viral exposure, e.g. health and key workers. We searched PubMed and medRxiv up to December 8, 2020 for papers on shift work patterns, health work and incidence of COVID-19 using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""shift work"" ""health worker"". Recent evidence suggests shift workers are also at increased risk of severe COVID-19 but it is not clear if the risk is exacerbated in those who work shifts in healthcare.

Added value of this studyThis study uses data from UK Biobank, a prospective cohort of >500,000 adults aged 40-69 years with baseline assessments between March 2006 and July 2010. Participants occupation was categorised according to whether or not they were health workers and/or shift workers at baseline. Results showed that being a health worker, or working shifts, were similarly and independently associated with over twice the population level risk of severe COVID-19 independent of age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and co-morbidities. The risk was seven times higher in health workers with shift working patterns. The impact of health and shift work tended to be higher in males and in minority ethnic groups, who are already at an increased risk of severe COVID-19. In people over the age of retirement, the risk of developing severe COVID-19 associated with baseline health worker status was no longer apparent, suggesting the risk is likely explained by exposure to the virus. However, the elevated risk associated with baseline shift worker status persisted, albeit attenuated.

Implications of all the available evidenceShift workers are at elevated risk of developing severe COVID-19. The persistence of an elevated risk in people who are now over retirement age, but had a shift worker status at baseline, suggests the risk may not be fully explained by increased exposure to the virus. Vaccination, therapeutic and prevention programmes are being prioritised for health care workers. Our data suggests that shift workers should also be prioritised for these preventive measures.",Alex Rowlands; Clare Gillies; Yogini Chudasama; Melanie Davies; Nazrul Islam; David Kloecker; Claire Lawson; Manish Pareek; Cameron Razieh; Francesco Zaccardi; Thomas Yates; Kamlesh Khunti,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248243,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248243,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
233,PTSD symptoms related to COVID-19 as a high risk factor for suicide - Key to prevention,"BackgroundRising rates of suicide, the most dreadful consequence of mental health effects elicited by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) are cause for grave concern. However, the exact association between mental health problems and suicide remains largely unknown in relation to COVID-19.

MethodsTo determine the impact of COVID-19 on suicide trajectory, we used an interrupted time-series design to analyze monthly suicides rates extracted from Japans national database. We next used mixed-effects regression models to investigate the relationship between the nationwide suicide increase in August 2020 and psychiatric states of 4,348 individuals from an online survey performed immediately before (December 2019) and during (August 2020) the pandemic. Psychiatric states included depression, anxiety, and COVID-19-related PTSD, a form of severe event-related stress.

FindingsIn Japan, suicides had gradually decreased before COVID-19 ({beta} = -0{middle dot}7x10-3, t57 = -14{middle dot}2, p = 8{middle dot}6x10-46), but increased drastically after a state of emergency was declared in April 2020 ({beta} = 0{middle dot}9x10-2, t57 = 17{middle dot}3, p = 2{middle dot}3x10-67). We found that PTSD symptoms reliably predict COVID-19s impact on suicide rates ({beta} = 6{middle dot}3x10-4, t3936 = 5{middle dot}96, p = 2{middle dot}7x10-9). In contrast, depression scores are a reliable indicator of stress vulnerability (i.e. future suicide increases, {beta} = 0{middle dot}001, t3936 = 6{middle dot}6, p = 4{middle dot}5x10-11). Simulations revealed that a one-point reduction in PTSD score could decrease suicides by up to 3{middle dot}1 per ten million people per month in Japan.

InterpretationPTSD symptoms may help to identify high-risk groups so as to increase efficacy of prevention policies.

234,Sub-national forecasts of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across the UK: a large-scale cross-sectional spatial modelling study,"IntroductionThere is evidence of decreasing uptake of routine immunisations in the UK in recent years. As the United Kingdom begins a mass vaccination campaign with a novel COVID-19 vaccine, it is unclear whether refusal of the vaccine in some regions and among some socio-economic groups will pose challenges for achieving herd/community immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsThis study estimates uptake of a COVID-19 at unprecedented spatial resolution across the UK using a large-scale survey and state-of-the-art Bayesian statistical methods for estimating public opinion. Between 24 September and 14 October 2020, 17,684 individuals are surveyed in a cross-sectional online survey design. Regions and socio-economic groups who may be more resistant towards a new vaccine are identified using multilevel regression and poststratification. Gibbs sampling is used for Bayesian model inference, with uncertainty in parameter estimates captured via 95% highest posterior density intervals.

FindingsThis study predicts that clusters of non-vaccinators will likely emerge in many regions across the UK, most notably in London (which has 13 of the 20 lowest ranking regions) and the North West (which has four, including Greater Manchester and Liverpool). Males are much more likely to state intent to accept the vaccine than females (OR 1{middle dot}59, 1{middle dot}47 to 1{middle dot}73); while Muslims are less likely than atheists / agnostics (0{middle dot}75, 0{middle dot}57 to 0{middle dot}96), Black / Black British are less likely than Whites (0{middle dot}47, 0{middle dot}38 to 0{middle dot}60), and Polish speakers (0{middle dot}45, 0{middle dot}31 to 0{middle dot}63) are less likely than those who primarily speak English or Welsh. Across the UK, 8{middle dot}7% (8{middle dot}2 to 9{middle dot}2%) state that they would ""definitely not"" accept a vaccine, but less than half (47{middle dot}5%, 46{middle dot}5 to 48{middle dot}5%) say they would ""definitely"" accept a COVID-19 vaccine, with a substantial proportion unsure.

InterpretationThe study findings are extremely important in the context of achieving herd/community immunity. Low predicted acceptance rates in parts of London and the North West are of particular concern as many of these regions have among the highest rates of COVID-19 infection across the UK: low vaccine uptake in these regions may result in disease ""hotspots"" that amplify the spread of the disease and require increases in vaccination levels in adjacent regions to provide nationwide herd/community immunity. It is therefore extremely important to identify such regions, and to engage with communities within them in advance of vaccination rollout to the population at large. Encouragingly, intent to accept a COVID-19 vaccine is higher among older age-groups, who are among the first to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

235,"SIREN protocol: Impact of detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 on the subsequent incidence of COVID-19 in 100,000 healthcare workers: do antibody positive healthcare workers have less reinfection than antibody negative healthcare workers?","BackgroundThe overall risk of reinfection in individuals who have previously had COVID-19 is unknown. To determine if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (as determined by at least one positive commercial antibody test performed in a laboratory) in healthcare workers confers future immunity to reinfection, we are undertaking a large-scale prospective longitudinal cohort study of healthcare staff across the United Kingdom.

MethodsPopulation and Setting: staff members of healthcare organisations working in hospitals in the UK

At recruitment, participants will have their serum tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 at baseline and using these results will be initially allocated to either antibody positive or antibody negative cohorts. Participants will undergo antibody and viral RNA testing at 1-4 weekly intervals throughout the study period, and based on these results may move between cohorts. Any results from testing undertaken for other reasons (e.g. symptoms, contact tracing etc.) or prior to study entry will also be included. Individuals will complete enrolment and fortnightly questionnaires on exposures and symptoms. Follow-up will be for at least 12 months from study entry.

OutcomeThe primary outcome of interest is a reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 during the study period. Secondary outcomes will include incidence and prevalence (both RNA and antibody) of SARS-CoV-2, viral genomics, viral culture, symptom history and antibody/neutralising antibody titres.

ConclusionThis large study will help us to understand the impact of the presence of antibodies on the risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2; the results will have substantial implications in terms of national and international policy, as well as for risk management of contacts of COVID-19 cases.

In Japan, they provided similar services from November, 2020.

ObjectWe compared Google AI forecasting with a statistical model by human intelligence.

MethodWe regressed the number of patients whose onset date was day t on the number of patients whose past onset date was 14 days prior, with information about traditional surveillance data for common pediatric infectious diseases including influenza, and prescription surveillance 7 days prior. We predicted the number of onset patients for 7 days, prospectively. Finally, we compared the result with Googles AI-produced forecast. We used the discrepancy rate to evaluate the precision of prediction: the sum of absolute differences between data and prediction divided by the aggregate of data.

ResultsWe found Google prediction significantly negative correlated with the actual observed data, but our model slightly correlated but not significant. Moreover, discrepancy rate of Google prediction was 27.7% for the first week. The discrepancy rate of our model was only 3.47%.

239,"Internal medicine clerkship amidst COVID-19 pandemic: clinical learning experience of undergraduate medical students at Makerere University, Uganda: a cross-sectional study","BackgroundThe coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to impose a significant impact on medical education. We aimed to describe the clinical learning experience of undergraduate medical students undertaking internal medicine clerkship during the COVID-19 pandemic at Makerere University, Uganda.

MethodsA descriptive, cross-sectional study among medical students in clinical years of study pursuing the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery undergraduate degree program was conducted in November 2020. Only 3rd (junior clerks) and 5th (senior clerks) year medical students whose internal medicine clerkships were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic were studied.

ResultsData of 188 (95%) eligible clinical year students; junior (101, 54.0%) and senior (86, 46.0%) were analysed. Median age was 24 (range: 22-42) years. Majority (70.1%) were male and Ugandan nationals (94.1%). Sixty-four (30.3%) students reported inadequate personal protective equipment, 152 (81.7%) felt at risk of contracting COVID-19, and 127 (67.9%) said it was difficult to observe COVID-19 standard operating procedures. Twenty-two students (11.9%) were discouraged from pursuing a career in internal medicine. Overall, most students reported good or excellent clinical experience pre-COVID-19 era compared to during the COVID-19 era (4.0 vs. 3.5, p<0.0001). Senior clerks significantly believed that the time allocated for the rotation was adequate (p<0.0001) and they were able to complete their study objectives (p<0.001), compared to the junior clerks. Senior clerks believed that learning was difficult when combined with junior clerks (p=0.013). About half of the students (51.4%, n=95) reported clinical teaching should remain as it was in the pre-COVID-19 era.

ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significantly negative effect on the clinical learning experience of the students. There is need to review the current teaching and learning methods to suit teaching and learning during pandemics of highly infectious diseases to ensure safe and effective learning experience.

ObjectiveTo determine changes in intensive care capacity in US acute care hospitals between September and early December, 2020 and to identify whether hospitals serving more vulnerable populations were more likely to exceed critical-levels of ICU occupancy.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsRetrospective observational cohort of US acute care hospitals reporting to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from September 4, 2020 to December 3, 2020. Hospitals in this cohort were compared to all US acute care hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between community socioeconomic factors and hospital-structural features with a hospital reaching critical ICU capacity.

ExposureCommunity-level socioeconomic status and hospital-structural features

Main Outcomes and MeasuresOur primary outcome was reaching critical ICU capacity (>90%) for at least two weeks since September 4. Secondary outcomes included the weekly capacity and occupancy tabulated by state and by hospital referral region.

Results1,791 hospitals had unsuppressed ICU capacity data in the HHS Protect dataset, with 45% of hospitals reaching critical ICU capacity for at least two weeks during the study period. Hospitals in the South (OR = 2.79, p<0.001), Midwest (OR = 1.76, p=0.01) and West (OR = 1.85, p<0.01) were more likely to reach critical capacity than those in the Northeast. For-profit hospitals (OR = 2.15, p<0.001), rural hospitals (OR = 1.40, p<0.05) and hospitals in areas of high uninsurance (OR = 1.94, p<0.001) were more likely to reach critical ICU capacity, while hospitals with more intensivists (OR = 0.92, p=0.044 and higher nurse-bed ratios (OR = 0.95, p=0.013) were less likely to reach critical capacity.

Conclusions and RelevanceNearly half of U.S. hospitals reporting data to HHS Protect have reached critical capacity at some point since September. Those that are better resourced with staff were less likely to do so while for for-profit hospitals and those in poorer communities were more likely to reach capacity. Continued non-pharmacologic interventions are clearly needed to spread of the disease to ensure ICUs remain open for all patients needing critical care.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWith an increasing number of SARS-CoV2 infections, how has the burden on ICU capacity changed over the past three months and what community and institutional factors are associated with hospitals reaching critical capacity?

Finding45% of US acute care hospitals have reached critical ICU capacity at some point over the past three months. Hospital located in areas with fewer insured people were more likely to reach critical ICU capacity. At an institutional level, for-profit hospitals, rural hospitals, and those that have less baseline staffing of intensivists and nurses were more likely to reach critical ICU capacity.

MeaningThe COVID-19 pandemic appears to be disproportionately straining ICUs with fewer resources and staff, setting up a substantial risk to widen disparities in access to care for already underserved populations.",Thomas C.

241,Renal Involvement in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia and Outcomes After Stem Cell Nebulization.,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment.

ObjectiveTo characterize acute renal injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 and their relation with clinical outcomes within the framework of the SENTAD COVID clinical trial at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center.

MethodsAbu Dhabi Stem Cell Center (ADSCC) proposed a prospective clinical trial nebulization treatment with autologous stem cells (Non-Hematopoietic Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (NHPBSC)), at Abu Dhabi hospitals.

Participants20 treated patients were compared with 23 not treated patients. Both groups received COVID 19 standard treatment.

OutcomesAfter the results were collected, this study was created to determine the impact of the disease on the renal function and the efficacy of the therapy on patients outcomes.

ResultsOne third of the critical patients studied suffered kidney failure. Patients in the treated group showed a favorable tendency to improve in contrast to those in the control group. Less patients from group A suffered from sepsis in comparison with the group B (25% vs 65%), HR=0.38, (95% Confidence Interval: 0.16 - 0.86), *p=0.0212. These results suggested a NNT=2.5. An improvement in lymphocyte count, CRP, and shorter hospital stay after treatment was evidenced, which led to less superinfection and sepsis in the treated group.

ConclusionsThe proposed anti-inflammatory effect of the stem cells, offers a great promise for managing the illness, emerging as a crucial adjuvant tool in promoting healing and early recovery in severe COVID-19 infections and other supportive treatments.

242,Optimality in COVID-19 vaccination strategies determined by heterogeneity in human-human interaction networks,"Interactions between humans cause transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that heterogeneity in human-human interactions give rise to non-linear infection networks that gain complexity with time. Consequently, targeted vaccination strategies are challenged as such effects are not accurately captured by epidemiological models assuming homogeneous mixing. With vaccines being prepared for global deployment determining optimality for swiftly reaching population level immunity in heterogeneous local communities world-wide is critical. We introduce a model that predicts the effect of vaccination into an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak using precision simulation of human-human interaction and infection networks. We show that simulations incorporating non-linear network complexity and local heterogeneity can enable governance with performance-quantified vaccination strategies. Vaccinating highly interactive people diminishes the risk for an infection wave, while vaccinating the elderly reduces fatalities at low population level immunity. Interestingly, a combined strategy is not better due to non-linear effects. While risk groups should be vaccinated first to minimize fatalities, significant optimality branching is observed with increasing population level immunity. Importantly, we demonstrate that regardless of immunization strategy non-pharmaceutical interventions are required to prevent ICU overload and breakdown of healthcare systems. The approach, adaptable in real-time and applicable to other viruses, provides a highly valuable platform for the current and future pandemics.",Bjoern Goldenbogen; Stephan Oliver Adler; Oliver Bodeit; Judith Wodke; Ximena Escalera-Fanjul; Aviv Korman; Maria Krantz; Lasse Bonn; Rafael Ubaldo Moran Torres; Johanna EL Haffner; Maxim Karnetzki; Ivo Maintz; Lisa Mallis; Hannah Prawitz; Patrick Steven Segelitz; Martin Seeger; Rune Linding; Edda Klipp,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248301,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248301,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
243,"Using Administrative Data to Incorporate Age and Sex-Dependent Resource Use for COVID-19 Acute Care Resource Use Simulations in Ontario, Canada","As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, more local data has become available, enabling a more granular modeling approach. In March 2020, we developed a COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) model to estimate the acute care resource use in Ontario, Canada. In this paper, we describe the evolution of CORE2.0 to incorporate age, sex, and time-dependent acute care resource use, length of stay, and mortality to simulate hospital occupancy. Demographics (e.g., age and sex) of infected cases are informed by 4-month averages between March-June, and July-October using 10-year age groups. The probability of hospitalization, ICU admission, and requiring mechanical ventilation are all age and sex-dependent. LOS for each acute care level ranges from 5.7 to 16.15 days in the ward, 6.5 to 10.7 days in the ICU without ventilation, and 14.8 to 21.6 days on the ventilator, depending on month of infection. We calibrated some LOS components to reported ward and ICU occupancy between June 15 and October 31, 2020. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of CORE2.0 for a regional analysis of Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada to simulate the ward bed, ICU bed, and ventilator occupancies for 30 days starting December 2020 for three case trajectory scenarios. Moving forward, this model has become highly flexible and customizable to data updates, and can better inform acute care planning and public measures as the pandemic progresses.",Stephen Mac; Raphael Ximenes; Kali Barrett; Yasin A Khan; Petros Pechlivanoglou; Juan David Rios; David MJ Naimark; Beate Sander,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248166,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248166,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
244,Understanding the net benefit of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19: An enhanced decision-curve analysis,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) offer the ability to diagnose COVID-19 rapidly and at low cost; however, lower sensitivity has limited adoption of Ag-RDT in clinical settings.

MethodsWe compared Ag-RDT, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), and clinical judgment alone for diagnosing COVID-19 among symptomatic patients. We investigated two scenarios: a high-prevalence hospital setting with 24-hour NAAT turnaround, and a lower-prevalence outpatient setting with 3-day NAAT turnaround. We simulated transmission from cases and contacts and relationships between time, viral burden, transmission, and case detection. We used decision curve analysis to compare diagnostic approaches, estimating the time- and infectivity-dependent benefit of each true-positive diagnosis.

ResultsIn the primary analysis comparing Ag-RDT and NAAT, greater net benefit was achieved with Ag-RDT in the outpatient setting and with NAAT in the hospital setting. In the hospital setting, Ag-RDT becomes more beneficial if NAAT turnaround times exceed 2 days or Ag-RDT sensitivity increases to at least 95% (relative to NAAT) during acute illness. Similarly, in the outpatient setting, NAAT could be more beneficial when NAAT turnaround time remains under 2 days or patients strictly isolate while awaiting results. Clinical judgment was preferred only if clinical diagnoses generated a robust clinical and public health response and false-positive diagnoses produced minimal harm.

ConclusionsFor diagnosing symptomatic COVID-19, Ag-RDT may provide greater net benefit than either NAAT or clinical judgment when NAAT turnaround times are more than two days. NAAT is likely to remain optimal for hospitalized patients with prolonged symptoms prior to admission.",Emily A Kendall; Nimalan Arinaminpathy; Jilian A Sacks; Yukari C Manabe; Sabine Dittrich; Samuel G Schumacher; David W Dowdy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248357,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248357,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
245,Impaired ICOS signaling between Tfh and B cells distinguishes hospitalized from ambulatory CoViD-19 patients,"Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by systemic immune responses that appear to be dysregulated with more severe CoViD-19 disease. Lymphopenia and delayed antibody responses are commonly identified in CoViD-19 subjects, and recent reports have demonstrated abrogation of germinal centers in severe CoViD-19. This work assessed a potential mechanistic basis for impaired humoral responses, focusing on the T follicular helper (Tfh) and B cell interface that is critical for germinal center reactions. Here we demonstrated that Tfh activity is impaired in hospitalized relative to ambulatory CoViD-19 subjects, potentially due to decreased expression of the costimulatory molecule ICOS-L on B cells. Functional impairment manifested as a diminished ability to stimulated Tfh derived IFN{gamma} and IL-21, the latter of which is critical for B cell proliferation and differentiation. Activation of Tfh cells by agonism of the ICOS receptor ex vivo by an agonistic antibody stimulated the generation of IFN{gamma}/IL-21 double positive cells from hospitalized CoViD-19 subjects. This report establishes an immunological defect that differentiates ambulatory from hospitalized CoViD and suggests that agents that could restore impaired mechanisms at the Tfh-B cell interface may be of therapeutic value.",Amanda Hanson; Heather Cohen; Hao Wang; Nandini Shekhar; Chinmayee Shah; Abha Dhaneshwar; Bethany W Harvey; Richard Murray; Christopher J Harvey,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248343,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248343,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,,True
246,Antibody responses to endemic coronaviruses modulate COVID-19 convalescent plasma functionality,"COVID-19 convalescent plasma, particularly plasma with high-titer SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibodies, has been successfully used for treatment of COVID-19. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-S titer but that suffer from low neutralizing activity.

Although many point-of-care antibody tests are available globally, they have been subjected to limited clinical validation. This has led to suboptimal outcomes in the field, where antibody tests play a significant role in tracking the immunity of individuals and communities. In this study an antibody test, ImmunoQuick that recognizes antibodies to the Nucleocapsid and Spike proteins of SARS CoV-2 was tested in 100 symptomatic patients with a positive or negative diagnosis of COVID-19, based on RT-PCR results. The overall sensitivity of the test was found to be 86.1% (95% CI: 76.4% to 92.8%) and specificity 100% (95% confidence interval: 73.5% to 100%).

248,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before and after symptom onset: impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as contact tracing and quarantine, are currently the primary means of controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2; however, it remains uncertain which interventions are most effective at reducing transmission at the population level. Using serial interval data from before and after the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China, we estimate that the relative frequency of presymptomatic transmission increased from 34% before the rollout to 71% afterward. The shift touward earlier transmission indicates a disproportionate reduction in transmission post-symptom onset. We estimate that, following the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions, transmission post-symptom onset was reduced by 82% whereas presymptomatic transmission decreased by only 16%. These findings suggest that interventions which limit opportunities for transmission in the later stages of infection, such as contact tracing and isolation, may have been particularly effective at reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Mary Bushman; Colin J.

Data from both hemispheres and the second wave provide opportunities to further examine climatic drivers. With a statistical method designed to detect transitory associations, we show consistent negative effects of temperature and absolute humidity at large spatial scales. At finer spatial resolutions we substantiate these connections during the seasonal rise and fall of COVID-19. Strong disease responses are identified between 12-18{degrees}C for Temperature and 4-12 g/m3 for Absolute Humidity.

250,Large-Scale Measurement of Aggregate Human Colocation Patterns for Epidemiological Modeling,"To understand and model public health emergencies, epidemiologists need data that describes how humans are moving and interacting across physical space. Such data has traditionally been difficult for researchers to obtain with the temporal resolution and geographic breadth that is needed to study, for example, a global pandemic. This paper describes Colocation Maps, which are spatial network datasets that have been developed within Facebooks Data For Good program. These Maps estimate how often people from different regions are colocated: in particular, for a pair of geographic regions x and y, these Maps estimate the probability that a randomly chosen person from x and a randomly chosen person from y are simultaneously located in the same place during a randomly chosen minute in a given week. These datasets are well suited to parametrize metapopulation models of disease spread or to measure temporal changes in interactions between people from different regions; indeed, they have already been used for both of these purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we show how Colocation Maps differ from existing data sources, describe how the datasets are built, provide examples of their use in compartmental modeling, and summarize ideas for further development of these and related datasets. We also conduct the first large-scale analysis of human colocation patterns across the world. Among the findings of this study, we observe that a pair of regions can exhibit high colocation despite few people moving between them. We also find that although few pairs of people are colocated for many days over the course of a week, these pairs can contribute significant fractions of the total colocation time within a region or between pairs of regions.",Shankar Iyer; Brian Karrer; Daniel T.

251,Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to guide vaccination strategy in a city,"Transmission chains within cities provide an important contribution to case burden and economic impact during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and should be a major focus for preventive measures to achieve containment. Here, at very high spatio-temporal resolution, we analysed determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a medium-sized European city. We combined detailed epidemiological, mobility, and socioeconomic data-sets with whole genome sequencing during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave. Both phylogenetic clustering and compartmental modelling analysis were performed based on the dominating viral variant (B.1-C15324T; 60% of all cases). Here we show that transmissions on the city population level are driven by the socioeconomically weaker and highly mobile groups. Simulated vaccination scenarios showed that vaccination of a third of the population at 90% efficacy prioritising the latter groups would induce a stronger preventive effect compared to vaccinating exclusively senior population groups first. Our analysis accounts for both social interaction and mobility on the basis of molecularly related cases, thereby providing high confidence estimates of the underlying epidemic dynamics that may readily be translatable to other municipal areas.",Sarah C.

The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT- qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples.

However, the exact mechanisms of thromboembolic events remain elusive. In this work, we show that immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass in patients with COVID-19 trigger the formation of procoagulant PLTs in a Fc-gamma-RIIA (Fc{gamma}RIIA) dependent pathway leading to increased thrombus formation in vitro. Most importantly, these events were significantly inhibited via Fc{gamma}RIIA blockade as well as by the elevation of PLTs intracellular cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate (cAMP) levels by the clinical used agent Iloprost. The novel findings of Fc{gamma}RIIA mediated prothrombotic conditions in terms of procoagulant PLTs leading to higher thrombus formation as well as the successful inhibition of these events via Iloprost could be promising for the future treatment of the complex coagulopathy observed in COVID-19 disease.

254,Accelerated intermittent theta burst as a substitute for patients needing electroconvulsive therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: study protocol for an open-label clinical trial,"BackgroundTreatment resistant depression (TRD) is one of the leading causes of disability in Canada and is associated with significant societal costs. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an approved, safe, and well-tolerated intervention for TRD. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the number of visits to the clinic is a potential approach to significantly minimize exposure and transmission risks to patients. This can be accomplished by administering multiple treatment sessions in a single day, using an rTMS protocol known as accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS). The objective of this novel study is to assess the feasibility, acceptance and clinical outcomes of a practical high-dose aiTBS protocol, including tapering treatments and symptom-based relapse prevention treatments, in patients with unipolar depression previously responsive to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or patients warranting ECT due to symptom severity.

MethodsAll patients with unipolar depression referred to the brain stimulation service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) who warrant ECT will be offered screening to assess for eligibility to enroll in this trial. This open label, single group trial consists of 3 phases. In the acute treatment phase, treatment will occur 8 times daily for 5 days a week, until symptom remission is achieved or a maximum of 10 days of treatment. In the tapering phase, treatments will be reduced to 2 treatment days per week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 treatment day per week for 2 weeks. Patients will then enter the symptom-based relapse prevention phase including virtual check-ins and a treatment schedule based on symptom level. Remission, response and change in scores on several clinical measures from baseline to the end of the acute, tapering and relapse prevention phases represent the clinical outcomes of interest.

DiscussionFindings from this novel clinical trial may provide support for the use of aiTBS, including tapering treatments and symptom-based relapse prevention treatments, as a safe and effective alternative intervention for patients needing ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic.

255,Exploring patient experiences of video consultations during Covid-19 in an outpatient care setting using routine feedback data from 955 contacts,"ObjectivesVideo consultations (VCs) have been rapidly implemented in response to Covid-19. However, limited research has explored patient experiences of VCs in this context. This research therefore explored patient experiences of VCs during their early stages of implementation in response to Covid-19.

DesignSecondary data analysis of routine patient survey responses using descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis.

Setting and participants955 (22.6%) survey responses following a VC using Attend Anywhere in a rural, aging and outpatient care setting between June and July 2020.

ResultsMost (93.2%) respondents reported having  good (n=210, 22.0%), or  very good (n=680, 71.2%) experiences with VCs. Most respondents accessed their VC alone (n=806, 84.4%), except for those aged 71+ (n=23/58, 39.7%). Most participants reported feeling listened to and understood (n=904, 94.7%), felt their needs had been met (n=860, 90.1%) and were able to communicate everything they wanted (n=848, 88.8%). Satisfaction with communication was very strongly associated with satisfaction with the technical performance of the VC (p<0.001). Free text responses had three key themes: i) barriers to VC use including technological difficulties, quality of patient information and accessibility or suitability concerns; ii) potential benefits including reduced stress and anxiety, enhanced accessibility, cost and time savings; and iii) patient suggested improvements including trial calls, turning music off, facilitating photo uploads, expanding written character limit and supporting other internet browsers. Most (92.1%) participants were likely to choose a VC again in the future.

ConclusionsThe vast majority of respondents reported positive experiences of VCs. Identified benefits of enhanced accessibility, affordability, time, monetary and environmental savings are particularly interesting for future service delivery.

256,The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns on the Behavior of Italian Citizens and Particulate Matter 10 and 2.5 Emissions in Lombardy,"Italy was one of the first nations in the world to have been heavily affected by the first wave of COVID-19. To date, it is among the first countries for both total cases and deaths. Numerous containment measures were taken from February to December 2020 to mitigate the pandemic, including total lockdowns across the entire country. The purpose of this research is to evaluate how these restrictions influenced Italian citizens consumption habits (like online shopping, smart working and distance learning) and particulate matter (PM) 10 and 2.5 concentrations in the Lombardy region. In particular, this survey is aimed at assessing the environmental sustainability of the behaviors adopted in response to the limitations of personal freedoms on a regional and national level and quantifying the effect of the latter on particulate concentrations in Lombardy, the region most damaged by both COVID-19 and air pollution. Many tools and online platforms have been used to collect data, such as Google Trends, web portals for sharing statistical and demographic information like the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and AdminStat Italia, and surveys conducted by the Department of Civil Protection, other scientific studies, and the main national newspapers. Technical data on particulate matter was collected from the website of the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment (ARPA). To highlight any significant change, the average daily concentrations of PM10 and 2.5 during 2020 in all the provinces of Lombardy were compared with those of the previous year. The comparison between the mean values was made through the t-test. Two values were considered as statistically confident when t < 1.9. However, since the real significance of these thresholds is not easily determined, we kept some margins of suspicious confidence. Finally, we looked for possible causal correlations between changes in citizens behavior and specific key events related to COVID-19. To do this, Pearson and Spearman correlations were used. The P-value threshold was indicatively set at 0.05. Microsoft Excel 2020 and Google Sheets software were used for data analysis. In conclusion, this paper showed a substantial ineffectiveness of total and partial lockdowns in reducing PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Lombardy. Furthermore, it estimates that COVID-19 has strongly changed the consumption habits of Italian citizens, forcing them to use home delivery services more actively which, at present, poses a potential additional threat to the environment. Among the positive aspects of this change there was the learning of the most modern technologies for distance teaching and smart working, a point from which to start for the construction of an energetically and environmentally sustainable policy.",Alessandro Rovetta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248285,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248285,2020-12-17,2020-12-17,,True
257,QFEA - A Method for Assessing the Filtration Efficiency of Face Mask Materials for Early Design Prototypes and Home Mask Makers,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the design and production of fabric face coverings. There are few published methods which enable mask designers, makers and purchasers to assess the relative filtration ability of mask making materials. Those methods which do exist are prohibitively expensive and difficult to conduct. As a result, mask makers, non-profits, and small-scale designers face difficult decisions when designing face coverings for personal and commercial use. In this paper, we propose a novel method, the Qualitative Filtration Efficiency Assessment (QFEA), for easily and inexpensively comparing the filtration efficiency of common materials. This method provides a highly affordable and readily available way to assess potential mask materials.",Eugenia O'Kelly; Anmol Arora; Corinne E O'Kelly; Charlotte Pearson; James Ward; P John Clarkson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20221937,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20221937,2020-12-17,2020-12-17,,True
258,"Impact of COVID-19 related unemployment on increased cardiovascular disease in a high-income country: Modeling health loss, cost and equity","BackgroundCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of health loss and health sector economic burdens in high-income countries. Unemployment is associated with increased risk of CVD, and so there is concern that the economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the CVD burden.

AimsThis modeling study aimed to quantify health loss, health cost burden and health inequities among people with CVD due to additional unemployment caused by COVID-19 pandemic-related economic disruption in one high-income country: New Zealand (NZ).

MethodsWe adapted an established and validated multi-state life-table model for CVD in the national NZ population. We modeled indirect effects (ie, higher CVD incidence due to high unemployment rates) for various scenarios of pandemic-related unemployment projections.

ResultsWe estimated the CVD-related heath loss in NZ to range from 23,300 to 36,900 HALYs (health-adjusted life years) for the different unemployment scenarios. Health inequities for M[a]ori (Indigenous population) were 3.7 times greater compared to non-M[a]ori (49.9 vs 13.5 HALYs lost per 1000 people).

Conclusions and policy implicationsUnemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause significant health loss and health inequities from CVD in this high-income country. Prevention measures should be considered by governments to reduce this risk, including job creation programs and measures directed towards CVD prevention.",Nhung Nghiem; Nick Wilson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248284,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248284,2020-12-17,2020-12-17,,True
259,Covid Fast Fax: A system for real-time triage of Covid-19 case report faxes,"The scale and speed of the COVID-19 pandemic has strained many parts of the national healthcare infrastructure, including communicable disease monitoring and prevention. Many local health departments now receive hundreds or thousands of COVID-19 case reports a day. Many arrive via faxed handwritten forms, often intermingled with other faxes sent to a general fax line, making it difficult to rapidly identify the highest priority cases for outreach and monitoring. We present an AI-based system capable of real-time identification and triage of handwritten faxed COVID-19 forms. The system relies on two models: one model to identify which received pages correspond to case report forms, and a second model to extract information from the set of identified case reports. We evaluated the system on a set of 1,224 faxes received by a local health department over a two-week period. For the 88% of faxes of sufficient quality, the system detects COVID-19 reports with high precision, 0.98, and high recall, 0.91. Among all received COVID-19 faxes, the system identifies high priority cases with a specificity of 0.87, a precision of 0.46 and recall of 0.83. Our system can be adapted to new forms, after a brief training period. Covid Fast Fax can support local health departments in their efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 and limit its impact on the community.

260,Exposure to Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors Is Associated with Reduced Mortality of Older Hypertensive Covid-19 Patients,"From a cohort of 1352 consecutive patients admitted with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy, between February and April 2020, we selected and studied 688 patients with arterial hypertension (254 deaths) to assess whether use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) prior to hospital admission affects mortality from Covid-19. Prior use of RASIs was associated with a lower mortality in the over-68 group of patients, whereas no evidence of a similar effect (whether protective or adverse) was found in the younger group. There was positive relative excess due to a statistically significant (p =0.001) interaction between prior RASI exposure and an age greater than 68 years, corresponding to a positive relative excess risk. Next we used the subgroup of 411 hypertensive patients older than 68 yrs to separately assess the effects prior use of two RASI drug subclasses, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiogiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), by comparing these two exposures with no exposure to RASIs. We found both prior use of ACEIs and prior use of ARBs to be associated with a lower Covid-19 mortality, after adjusting for 32 medical history variables via propensity score matching. (ORACEI = 0.57, 95%CI 0.36 to 0.91, p =0.018) (ORARB = 0.49, 95%CI 0.29 to 0.82, p =0.006).",Mauro Gori; Carlo Berzuini; Emilia D'Elia; Arianna Ghirardi; Luisa Bernardinelli; Antonello Gavazzi; Giulio Balestrieri; Andrea Giammarresi; Roberto Trevisan; Fabiano Di Marco; Antonio Bellasi; Mariangela Amoroso; Federico Raimondi; Luca Novelli; Bianca Magro; Gianpaolo Mangia; Ferdinando L.

261,Quantifying the importance and location of SARS-CoV-2 transmission events in large metropolitan areas,"Detailed characterizations of SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk across different social settings can inform the design of targeted and less disruptive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), yet these data have been lacking. Here we integrate real-time, anonymous and privacy-enhanced geolocalized mobility data with census and demographic data in the New York City and Seattle metropolitan areas to build a detailed agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The aim is to estimate where, when, and how many transmission events happened in those urban areas during the first wave of the pandemic. We estimate that most infections (80%) are produced by a small number of people (27%), and that about 10% of events can be considered super-spreading events (SSEs), i.e. generating more than eight secondary infections. Although mass gatherings present an important risk for future SSEs, we find that the bulk of transmission in the first wave occurred in smaller events at settings like workplaces, grocery stores, or food venues. We also observe that places where the majority of transmission and SSEs happened changed during the pandemic and are different across cities, a signal of the large underlying behavioral component underneath them. Our results demonstrate that constant real-time tracking of transmission events is needed to create, evaluate, and refine more effective and localized measures to contain the pandemic.",Alberto Aleta; David Martin-Corral; Michiel Bakker; Ana Pastore y Piontti; Marco Ajelli; Maria Litvinova; Matteo Chinazzi; Natalie E Dean; M.

262,"Influence of clinical characteristics and anti-cancer therapy on outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 5,678 cancer patients","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic started a healthcare crisis and heavily impacted cancer services.

MethodsData from cohort studies of COVID-19 cancer patients published up until October 23rd 2020 from PubMed, PubMed Central, medRxiv and Google Scholar were reviewed. Meta-analyses using the random effects model was performed to assess the risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19.

ResultsOur meta-analyses including up to 5,678 patients from 13 studies showed that the following were all statistically significant risk factors for death following SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients: age of 65 and above, presence of co-morbidities, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes and hypertension. There was no evidence that patients who had received cancer treatment within 60 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a higher risk of death, including patients who had recent chemotherapy.

ConclusionsCancer patients are susceptible to severe COVID-19, especially older patients and patients with co-morbidities who will require close monitoring. Our findings support the continued administration of anti-cancer therapy during the pandemic. The analysis of chemotherapy was powered at 70% to detect an effect size of 1.2 but all other anti-cancer treatments had lower power.

263,Physiological Effects of Exercising at Different Intensities Wearing TNT or Double-layer Cotton Facemasks Compared to Not Wearing a Mask,"We compared the physiological differences between exercising wearing a TNT or a double-layer-cotton (DLC) facemask (FM) and not wearing a mask (NM). Sixteen volunteers underwent 4 sets (S) of 2 sequential bouts (B). B1 and B2 corresponded to light and moderate intensity cycling, respectively. FMs were used as follows: S1: NM; S2: TNT or DLC; S3: DLC or TNT; and S4: NM. Metabolic, pulmonary, and perceptual variables were collected. The main results are expressed as effect sizes and confidence intervals (ES [95%CI]) for TNT and DLC unless otherwise indicated. Compared to NM, FM increased the duty cycle (B1=1.11[0.58-1.61] and 1.53[0.81-2.18]; B2=1.27[0.63-1.84] and 1.93[0.97-2.68]) and decreased breath frequency (B1=0.59[0.23-0.94] and 1.43[0.79-2.07], B2=0.39[0.05-0.71] and 1.33[0.71-1.94]). Only B1 tidal volume increased (0.33[0.09-0.56] and 0.62[0.18-1.05]) enough to avoid a ventilation reduction with TNT but not with DLC (B1=0.52[0.23-0.79]; B2=0.84[0.44-1.22]). Both FMs reduced oxygen saturation in B1 (0.56 [0.07-1.03] and 0.69 [0.09-1.28]) but only DLC did so in B2 (0.66 [0.11-1.13]). Both end tidal CO2 (B1=0.23[0.05-0.4] and 0.71[0.38-1.02]; B2=0.56[0.2-0.9] and 1.20[0.65-1.68]) and mixed-expired-CO2 (B1=0.74[0.38-1.08] 1.71[1.03-2.37], B2=0.94[0.45-1.38] and 1.78[0.97-2.42]) increased with FMs. Ventilatory adaptations imposed during FM exercising influenced blood-lung gas exchange.

264,Modelling conformational state dynamics and its role on infection for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants,"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected us all, from individuals to the world economy. Whereas great advances have been achieved in record time, a lot remains to be learned about the infection mechanisms of its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The Spike protein interacts with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor as part of the viral entry mechanism. To do so, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike needs to be in an open state conformation. Here we utilise coarse-grained normal mode analyses to model the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the transition probabilities between open and closed conformations for the wild type, the D614G mutant as well other variants isolated experimentally. We proceed to perform several possible in silico single mutations of Spike, 17081 in total, to determine positions and specific Spike mutations that may affect the occupancy of the open and closed states. We estimate transition probabilities between the open and closed states from the calculated normal modes. Transition probabilities are employed in a Markov model to determine conformational state occupancies. Our results correctly model a shift in occupancy of the more infectious D614G strain towards higher occupancy of the open state via an increase of flexibility of the closed state and concomitant decrease of flexibility of the open state. Our results also suggest that the N501Y mutation recently observed, drastically increases the occupancy of the open state. We utilize global vibrational entropy differences to select candidate single point mutations that affect the flexibility of the open and closed states and confirm that these lead to shifts in occupancies for the most critical mutations. Among those, we observe a number of mutations on Glycine residues (404, 416, 504) and G252 in particular accepting a number of mutations. Other residues include K417, D467 and N501. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations thereon. The specific mutations of Spike identified here, while still requiring experimental validation, may guide future studies to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms as well as guide public health in their surveillance efforts.",Natália Teruel; Olivier Mailhot; Rafael Najmanovich,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.423118,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.423118,2020-12-17,2020-12-17,,False
265,Suppression of miR-155 attenuates lung cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in human ACE2-transgenic mice,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recent global pandemic. It is a deadly human viral disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a high rate of infection, morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is a great urgency to develop new therapies to control, treat and prevent this disease. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) of the viral host are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication, and building an antiviral cellular defense. Here, we have analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, we have analyzed the potency of anti-miR-155 therapy in a COVID-19 mouse model (mice transgenic for human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 receptor (tg-mice hACE2)). We report for the first time that miR-155 expression is elevated in COVID-19 patients. Further, our data indicate that the viral load as well as miR-155 levels are higher in male relative to female patients. Moreover, we find that the delivery of anti-miR-155 to SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 effectively suppresses miR-155 expression, and leads to improved survival and clinical scores. Importantly, anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice hACE2 infected with SARS-CoV-2 not only exhibit reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also have increased anti-viral and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in the lungs. Thus, our study suggests anti-miR-155 as a novel therapy for mitigating the lung cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Dharmendra Kumar Soni; Juan Cabrera-Luque; Swagata Kar; Chaitali Sen; Joseph Devaney; Roopa Biswas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.423130,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.423130,2020-12-17,2020-12-17,,False

ObjectiveTo estimate the extent to which the scientific workforce in different fields has been engaged publishing papers relative to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design, setting, and participantsWe evaluated Scopus (data cut, December 1, 2020) for all indexed published papers and preprints relevant to COVID-19. We mapped this COVID-19 literature in terms of its authors across 174 subfields of science according to the Science Metrix classification. We also evaluated the extent to which the most influential scientists across science (based on a composite citation indicator) had published COVID-19-related research. Finally, we assessed the features of authors who published the highest number of COVID-19 publications and of those with the highest impact in the COVID-19 field based on the composite citation indicator limited to COVID-19 publications.

Main outcomes and measuresPublishing scientists (authors) and their published papers and citation impact.

Results84,180 indexed publications were relevant to COVID-19 including 322,279 unique authors. The highest rates of COVID-19 publications were seen for authors classified in Public Health and in Clinical Medicine, where 11.3% (6,388/56,516) and 11.1% (92,570/833,060) of authors, respectively, had published on COVID-19. Almost all (173/174) subfields (except for Automobile Design & Engineering) had some authors publishing on COVID-19. Among active scientists at the top 2% of citation impact, 15,803 (13.3%) had published on COVID-19 in their publications in the first 11 months of 2020.

The rates were the highest in the fields of Clinical Medicine (27.7%) and Public Health (26.8%). In 83 of the 174 subfields of science, at least one in ten active, influential authors in that field had authored something on COVID-19. 65 authors had already at least 30 (and up to 133) COVID-19 publications each. Among the 300 authors with the highest composite citation indicator for COVID-19 publications, 26 were journalists or editors publishing news stories or editorials in prestigious journals; most common countries for the remaining were China (n=77), USA (n=66), UK (n=27), and Italy (n=20).

We leverage an increase in balcony birdwatching, a million eBird entries, and difference-in-difference techniques to test if avian species richness rose during Indias COVID lockdown. We find that birdwatchers in Indias 20 most populous cities observed 8-17% more species during the lockdown. Most additional observations occurred after a two-week lag, signaling greater abundance instead of improved detection. More frequent appearances of at-risk, rare, and common species were recorded, implying that making our cities more wildlife friendly can protect threatened species in addition to urban specialists.

269,Comparison of Healthcare costs and benefits of the UK's Covid-19 response with four European countries: Decision Modelling Study,"BackgroundIn responding to covid-19, governments have tried to balance protecting health while minimising Gross Domestic Product (GDP) losses. We compare health-related net benefit (HRNB) and GDP losses associated with government responses of the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden from UK healthcare payer perspective.

MethodsWe compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under ""mitigation"" to modelled events under ""no mitigation"" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at {pound}20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses.

FindingsThe UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, {pound}33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and {pound}1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at {pound}20,000/QALY. Per capita, this is comparable to {pound}1,455 GDP loss using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total {pound}3075 GDP loss.

Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita. These also offset a greater percentage of total GDP losses per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. Countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes.

InterpretationThe benefit of government covid-19 responses may outweigh their economic costs. The extent that HRNB offset economic losses appears to relate to population characteristics, testing levels, and mask wearing, rather than response stringency.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOur research question was how the health-related net benefits and economic impacts of the UK response to the covid-19 epidemic first wave compared to other European countries. We searched PubMed, MedRxiv, and Arxiv for terms related to cost-effectivness, covid-19, and the UK.

Two studies compared predicted lives saved to predicted gross domestic product (GDP) losses. One found that lives saved by a lockdown would outweigh GDP losses, while another found a lockdown to cost {pound}10million per life saved. A later modelling study used quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), going beyond lives saved, and found cost per QALY was below {pound}50,000{middle dot} A fourth, comparing observed to modelled deaths and hospitalisations, found the cost per QALY was at least {pound}220,000, and thus the UK response was not cost-effective. None of these were international comparisons. One international study found good health and economic outcomes to be correlated. Another found global trade reductions and voluntary behavioural changes to have greater impact on economic growth than government measures. Neither considered cost-effectiveness. However, they suggest comparison to GDP loss is naive as this is total loss and not that due to government restrictions.

Added value of this studyWe compare the UK to Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden on health-related net benefits and economic impacts of government response from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. We describe countries response measures. We compared model predictions of outcomes under ""no mitigation"" to observed outcomes under ""mitigation"" up to July 20th 2020. We estimated healthcare costs, QALYs, and health-related net benefit (HRNB) saved. We compared HRBN to GDP losses using Sweden as a ""minimal mitigation"" comparator and calculated the % of total GDP loss they offset.

We found the UK saved 3{middle dot}17 (0{middle dot}32-3{middle dot}65) million QALYs, {pound}33 ({pound}8-38) billion in healthcare costs, and {pound}1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at the NHS threshold of {pound}20,000/QALY. This is comparable to the {pound}1,455 GDP loss per capita using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46{middle dot}1% (7{middle dot}1-53{middle dot}2) of the total estimated {pound}3075 GDP loss per capita. We found that Germany, Spain, and probably Sweden had greater HRNB per capita and offset greater percentages of GDP loss per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. We found countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility (e.g. older and more interpersonal contact) had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe add to growing evidence that the total economic impact of covid-19 exceeds the HRNB of the UKs response. However, using Sweden as comparator and comparing across countries, we argue that GDP loss is not purely due to government restrictions and that due to restrictions may be outweighed by HRNB. We evaluated the extent to which countries have offset GDP losses, and these appear to be higher in countries with more at-risk populations, higher testing, and higher mask wearing, rather than those with most stringent restrictions.",Howard Thom; Josephine Walker; Peter Vickerman; Will Hollingworth,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248201,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248201,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
270,Investigating mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums,"ObjectivesOnline health forums provide rich and untapped real-time data on population health. Through novel data extraction and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we characterise the evolution of mental and physical health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic among online health forum users.

Setting and designWe obtained data from 739,434 posts by 53,134 unique users of three leading online health forums: HealthBoards, Inspire and HealthUnlocked, from the period 1st January 2020 to 31st May 2020. Using NLP, we analysed the content of posts related to COVID-19.

ResultsPosts discussing COVID-19 and related comorbid disorders spiked in early- to mid-March around the time of global implementation of lockdowns prompting a large number of users to post on online health forums for the first time. The pandemic and corresponding public response has had a significant impact on posters queries regarding mental health.

271,Utility of COVID-19 Decision Rules Related to Consecutive Decline in Positivity or Hospitalizations: A Data-driven Simulation Study,"The White House issued Guidelines for Opening Up America Again to help state and local officials when reopening their economies. These included a ""downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period."" To examine this rule, we computed the probability of observing continuous decline in positivity when true positivity is in decline using data-driven simulation. Data for COVID-19 positivity reported in New York state from April 14 to May 5, 2020, where a clear reduction was observed, were used. First, a logistic regression model was fitted to the data, considering the fitted values as true positivity. Second, we created observed positivity by randomly selecting 25,000 people per day from a population with those true positivity for 14 days. The simulation was repeated 1,000 times to compute the probability of observing a consecutive decline. As sensitivity analyses, we performed the simulation with different daily numbers of tests (10 to 30,000) and length of observation (7 and 21 days). We further used daily hospitalizations as another metric, using data from the state of Indiana. With 25,000 daily tests, the probability of a consecutive decline in positivity for 14 days was 99.9% (95% CI: 99.7% to 100%). The probability dropped with smaller numbers of tests and longer lengths of consecutive observation, because there is more chance of observing an increase in positivity with smaller numbers of tests and longer observation. The probability of consecutive decline in hospitalizations was [~]0.0% regardless of the length of consecutive observation due to large variance. These results suggest that continuous declines in sample COVID-19 test positivity and hospitalizations may not be observed with sufficient probability, even when population probabilities truly decline. Criteria based on consecutive declines in metrics are unlikely to be useful for making decisions about relaxing COVID-19 mitigation efforts.",Keisuke Ejima; Kevin Maki; Lilian Golzarri-Arroyo; David B.

272,The association of covid-19 infection with household food insecurity among Iranian population,"ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the association of food insecurity score with the status of Covid-19 infection.

DesignAn online cross-sectional study. Demographic and socio-economic information were collected by questionnaire. Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) was used in assessing household food security status. The analysis data was done by IBM SPSS 22.0, using Chi-square test, ANOVA test and Multinomial logistic regression model.

SettingIran

Participants2871 Iranian adults (over 18 years old)

Resultsfindings indicated that men [OR=0.60, CI= (0.41, 0.87), P<0.05], and healthcare personnel [OR=3.66, CI= (1.90, 7.05), P<0.001] were at higher risk for Covid-19. It was also shown that the food insecurity score is significantly higher among infected people compared to not-infected [OR=1.03, CI= (1.00, 1.05), P<0.05]. The comparison between suspected and not-infected individuals only indicated the significant differences in perceived COVID-19 prevention score, which was higher among not-infected people [OR=0.88, CI=(0.84,0.93), P<0.001].

273,"Anosmia and other SARS-CoV-2 positive test-associated symptoms, across three national, digital surveillance platforms as the COVID-19 pandemic and response unfolded: an observation study","BackgroundMultiple participatory surveillance platforms were developed across the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a real-time understanding of community-wide COVID-19 epidemiology. During this time, testing criteria broadened and healthcare policies matured. We sought to test whether there were consistent associations of symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 test status across three national surveillance platforms, during periods of testing and policy changes, and whether inconsistencies could better inform our understanding and future studies as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.

MethodsFour months (1st April 2020 to 31st July 2020) of observation through three volunteer COVID-19 digital surveillance platforms targeting communities in three countries (Israel, United Kingdom, and United States). Logistic regression of self-reported symptom on self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test status (or test access), adjusted for age and sex, in each of the study cohorts. Odds ratios over time were compared to known changes in testing policies and fluctuations in COVID-19 incidence.

FindingsAnosmia/ageusia was the strongest, most consistent symptom associated with a positive COVID-19 test, based on 658,325 tests (5% positive) from over 10 million respondents in three digital surveillance platforms using longitudinal and cross-sectional survey methodologies. During higher-incidence periods with broader testing criteria, core COVID-19 symptoms were more strongly associated with test status. Lower incidence periods had, overall, larger confidence intervals.

InterpretationThe strong association of anosmia/ageusia with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity is omnipresent, supporting its validity as a reliable COVID-19 signal, regardless of the participatory surveillance platform or testing policy. This analysis highlights that precise effect estimates, as well as an understanding of test access patterns to interpret differences, are best done only when incidence is high. These findings strongly support the need for testing access to be as open as possible both for real-time epidemiologic investigation and public health utility.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAs the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, testing capacity expanded and governmental guidelines adapted, generally encouraging testing with a broader set of symptoms, not just fever with respiratory symptoms. In parallel, multiple large-scale citizen science digital surveillance platforms launched to complement knowledge from laboratory and somewhat smaller clinical studies. Symptoms such as loss of sense of smell have been identified as strongly predictive of COVID-19 infection in both clinical and syndromic surveillance analyses, and have therefore been used to inform these testing policy changes and access expansion.

Added value of this studyThis study identifies symptoms that are or are not consistently associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity over time and across three country-based COVID-19 surveillance platforms in the United States, United Kingdom and Israel. These platforms are website and smartphone based, as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal. The study period of 4 months covers fluctuating COVID-19 prevalence during the fall of the first wave and, in some areas, rise of the second wave. In addition, the study period overlaps expansion of test access and test seeking. Importantly, these analyses track and highlight the value of individual symptoms to predict SARS-CoV-2 test positivity under a range of conditions.

Implications of all the available evidenceDespite differences in surveillance methodology, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing and disease prevalence, loss of sense of smell or taste was consistently the strongest predictor of COVID-19 infection across all platforms over time. As access to testing broadened, the relevance of COVID-like symptoms and consistency of their predictive ability became apparent. However, confidence bounds generally widened with a fall in COVID-19 incidence. Therefore, for the most robust symptom-based COVID-19 prediction models should consider surveillance data during periods of higher incidence and improved test access, and effect estimates that replicate across different epidemiologic conditions and platforms.",Carole Helene Sudre; Ayya Keshet; Mark S Graham; Amit D Joshi; Smadar Shilo; Hagai Rossman; Benjamin Murray; Erika Molteni; Kerstin Klaser; Liane S Canas; Michela Antonelli; Marc Modat; Joan Capdevila Pujol; Sajaysurya Ganesh; Jonathan Wolf; Tomer Meir; Andrew T Chan; Claire Steves; Timothy Spector; John S Brownstein; Eran Segal; Sebastien Ourselin; Christina Astley,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248096,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248096,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

We report a nucleic acid test that integrates distinct mechanisms of DNA and RNA amplification optimized for high sensitivity and rapid kinetics, linked to Cas13 detection for specificity. We paired this workflow, termed Diagnostics with Coronavirus Enzymatic Reporting (DISCoVER), with extraction-free sample lysis using shelf-stable reagents that are widely available at low cost. DISCoVER has been validated on saliva samples to incentivize frequent testing for more widespread community surveillance and robustly detected attomolar levels of SARS-CoV-2 within 30 minutes, while avoiding false positives in virus-negative saliva.

275,The Presence of Ambulatory Hypoxia as an Early Predictor of Moderate to Severe COVID-19 Disease,"BackgroundThe importance of ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia in COVID-19 is unknown. Ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia may help objectively identify high-risk patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Interventions may be initiated earlier with sufficient lead-time between development of ambulatory hypoxia and other outcome measures.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to October 30, 2020 in ten hospitals in an integrated academic medical system in the Chicagoland area. We analyzed patients who had daily ambulatory oximetry measurements, excluding patients who had first ambulatory oximetry measurements after the use of oxygen therapies (nasal cannula or advanced oxygen therapies). We determined the association of ambulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia with the eventual need for nasal cannula or advanced oxygen therapies (defined as high flow nasal cannula, Bi-PAP, ventilator, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). We also calculated the time between development of ambulatory hypoxia and the need for oxygen therapies.

ResultsOf 531 patients included in the study, 132 (24.9%) had ambulatory hypoxia. Presence of ambulatory hypoxia was strongly associated with subsequent use of nasal cannula (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.8 - 8.4) and advanced oxygen therapy (IRR 7.7, 95% CI 3.4 - 17.5). Ambulatory hypoxia preceded nasal cannula use by a median 12.5 hours [IQR 3.25, 29.25] and advanced oxygenation therapies by 54 hours [IQR 25, 82].

ConclusionAmbulatory hypoxia without resting hypoxia may serve as an early, non-invasive physiologic marker for the likelihood of developing moderate to severe COVID-19 and help clinicians triage patients and initiate earlier interventions.",Ajay Bhasin; Melissa Bregger; Mark Kluk; Peter Park; Joseph Feinglass; Jeffrey Barsuk,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248209,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248209,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

MethodsWe established and analyzed a registry of pediatric COVID-19 in Western PA that includes cases in patients <22 years of age cared for by the pediatric quaternary medical center in the area and its associated pediatric primary care network from March 11 through August 20, 2020.

ResultsOur cohort included 424 pediatric COVID-19 cases (mean age 12.5 years, 47.4% female); 65% reported exposure and 79% presented with symptoms. The most common initial healthcare contact was through telehealth (45%). Most cases were followed as outpatients, but twenty-two patients (4.5%) were hospitalized: 19 with acute COVID-19 disease, and three for multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C). Admitted patients were younger (p<0.001) and more likely to have pre-existing conditions (p<0.001). Black/Hispanic patients were 5.8 times more likely to be hospitalized than white patients (p=0.012). Five patients (1.2%) were admitted to the PICU, including all three MIS-C cases; two required BiPAP and one mechanical ventilation. All patients survived.

ConclusionsWe provide a comprehensive snapshot of pediatric COVID-19 disease in an area with low to moderate incidence. In this cohort, COVID-19 was generally a mild disease; however, [~]5% of children were hospitalized.

277,Rapid processing of SARS-CoV-2 containing specimens for direct RT-PCR,"Widespread diagnostic testing is needed to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and manage the pandemic. Effective mass screening requires robust and sensitive tests that reliably detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections with a low viral count. Currently, the most accurate tests are based on detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. We developed a method to process COVID-19 specimens that simplifies and increases the sensitivity of viral RNA detection by direct RT-qPCR, performed without RNA purification. In the method, termed Alkaline-Glycol Processing (AG processing), a SARS-CoV-2-containing biological specimen, such as saliva or a swab-collected suspension, is processed at pH 12.2 to 12.8 for 5 min at room temperature. An aliquot of the AG-processed specimen is used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR. AG processing effectively lyses viruses and reduces the effect of inhibitors of RT-PCR that are present in biological specimens. The sensitivity of detecting viral RNA using AG processing is on par with methods that include a viral RNA purification step. One copy of SARS-CoV-2 virus per reaction, equivalent to 300 copies per ml of saliva, is detectable in the AG-processed saliva. The LOD calculated following U.S. FDA guidelines is 600 viral copies per ml of initial saliva specimen. AG processing works with saliva specimens or swab specimens collected into Universal Transport Medium (UTM), is compatible with heat treatment, and was confirmed to work with a range of CDC-approved RT-qPCR products and kits. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using AG processing with direct RT-qPCR provides a reliable and scalable diagnostic test for COVID-19 that can be integrated into a range of workflows, including automated settings.",Piotr Chomczynski,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248183,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248183,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

279,Vaccine Prioritisation Using Bluetooth Exposure Notification Apps,"After vaccinating health care workers and vulnerable groups against COVID-19, authorities will need to decide how to vaccinate everyone else. Prioritising individuals with more contacts can be disproportionately effective, in theory, but identifying these individuals is difficult. Here we show that the technology underlying Bluetooth exposure notification applications, such as used for digital contact tracing, can be leveraged to prioritise vaccination based on individual contact data. Our approach is based on the insight that these apps also act as local sensing devices measuring each users total exposure time to other users, thereby enabling the implementation of a previously impossible strategy that prioritises potential super-spreaders. Furthermore, by generalising percolation theory and introducing a novel measure of vaccination efficiency, we demonstrate that this ""hot-spotting"" strategy can achieve herd immunity with up to half as many vaccines as a non-targeted strategy, and is attractive even for relatively low rates of app usage.",Mark D Penney; Yigit Yargic; Lee Smolin; Edward W Thommes; Madhur Anand; Chris T Bauch,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248186,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248186,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

AimThis study aimed to elucidate area level characteristics linked to testing rates.

MethodsFree-of-charge diagnostic tests (PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 was made available to the general public in late June 2020 in Uppsala County, Sweden, at four main test stations, and to a lesser extent at other health care units. We analysed 35,794 tests performed on individuals from 346 postal codes, from 24 June to 12 October 2020.

ResultsWe observed varying testing rates across postal code areas within Uppsala City as well as in Uppsala County. Testing rates were lower in areas characterized by longer distance to the nearest test station, lower neighbourhood deprivation index indicating higher deprivation (NDI) and higher proportion of inhabitants with foreign background. Multivariable regression models could not separate influences of foreign background and NDI on COVID-19 testing rates as these were collinear. Further, we did not detect any association between COVID-19 hospitalization rates and testing rates, indicating that underlying community infection rates did not substantially affect test frequency during this period.

ConclusionWe observed that testing rates were associated with distance to test station and socioeconomic and demographic circumstances.

Overall, 879 students were randomly sampled and participated in this study. In an online survey, the randomly sampled participants nominated a friend, and reported their own and their nominated friends COVID-19 status. Nominated friends were about 1.64 (95% CI: 1.33, 2.00) times more likely to have ever been infected with COVID-19, compared to randomly sampled students.

282,REACT-1 round 7 updated report: regional heterogeneity in changes in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second national COVID-19 lockdown in England,"BackgroundEngland exited a four-week second national lockdown on 2nd December 2020 initiated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior results showed that prevalence dropped during the first half of lockdown, with greater reductions in higher-prevalence northern regions.

MethodsREACT-1 is a series of community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity in England, designed to monitor the spread of the epidemic and thus increase situational awareness. Round 7 of REACT-1 commenced swab-collection on 13th November 2020. A prior interim report included data from 13th to 24th November 2020 for 105,122 participants. Here, we report data for the entire round with swab results obtained up to 3rd December 2020.

ResultsBetween 13th November and 3rd December (round 7) there were 1,299 positive swabs out of 168,181 giving a weighted prevalence of 0.94% (95% CI 0.87%, 1.01%) or 94 per 10,000 people infected in the community in England. This compares with a prevalence of 1.30% (1.21%, 1.39%) from 16th October to 2nd November 2020 (round 6), a decline of 28%. Prevalence during the latter half of round 7 was 0.91% (95% CI, 0.81%, 1.03%) compared with 0.96% (0.87%, 1.05%) in the first half. The national R number in round 7 was estimated at 0.96 (0.88, 1.03) with a decline in prevalence observed during the first half of this period no longer apparent during the second half at the end of lockdown. During round 7 there was a marked fall in prevalence in West Midlands, a levelling off in some regions and a rise in London. R numbers at regional level ranged from 0.60 (0.41, 0.80) in West Midlands up to 1.27 (1.04, 1.54) in London, where prevalence was highest in the east and south-east of the city. Nationally, between 13th November and 3rd December, the highest prevalence was in school-aged children especially at ages 13-17 years at 2.04% (1.69%, 2.46%), or approximately 1 in 50.

ConclusionBetween the previous round and round 7 (during lockdown), there was a fall in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity nationally, but it did not fall uniformly over time or by geography.

We study the effects of the policy actions on the progression of the pandemic in the first containment period in spring 2020 before easing of measures have started to work by the end of April. To exploit both the time and spatial dimension in the dissemination of the virus, we conduct a spatial data panel analysis for German NUTS-3 regions. Specifically, we employ a spatial difference-in-differences approach to identify the effects of individual public health measures. We find that contact restrictions and closure of schools substantially contributed to flattening the infection curve. Additionally, a strong treatment effect of wearing face masks is established in the few treated regions during the containment phase. No incremental effect is evidenced for closure of establishments and shutdown of shopping malls and other stores. These findings prove to be highly robust to changes in model specification.

Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia.

MethodsWe conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia from March 2nd to October 26th, 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the hazard risk ratio (HR) by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence, and socioeconomic strata.

ResultsThere were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between March 2nd and October 26th. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR=1.68 95% CI: 1.64-1.72), in people older than 60 years (HR=296.58 95% CI: 199.22-441.51), in indigenous people (HR=1.20 95% CI: 1.08-1.33), in people with subsidized health insurance regime (HR=1.89 95% CI: 1.83-1.96), and in people living in the very low socioeconomic strata (HR=1.44 95% CI: 1.24-1.68).

285,Social distancing and preventive practices of government employees in response to COVID-19 in Ethiopia,"BackgroundPublic health measures are critical to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Ethiopia has implemented a variety of essential public health measures in response to the spread of the virus. This study aimed to assess social distancing and preventive practices of government employees in response to COVID-19.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among 1573 government employees selected from 46 public institutions (16 National, 18 from Addis Ababa City Administration, and 12 from Oromia Regional State) located in Addis Ababa. Data were collected from 8th to 19th June 2020 using a paper-based self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0. ANOVA and t-tests were applied to assess the difference between groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with outcome variables.

ResultsThe majority of the participants reported wearing of facemask (96%), avoiding close contact with people including handshaking (94.5%), frequent had washing (94.1%), maintaining physical distancing (89.5%), avoiding mass gatherings (88.1%), and restricting movement and travelling (84.1%). More than 80% of the participants perceived that consistently wearing a facemask is highly effective in preventing the transmission of coronavirus. Participants from Oromia reported statistically significantly lower odds of perceived effectiveness of facemask in preventing coronavirus infection (adjusted OR=0.27, 95% CI:0.17-0.45). About 19% of the respondents reported that they had ever tested for COVID-19. Participants within the age groups of 18-29 were more likely to test for coronavirus than the older age groups. Whilst, respondents from Oromia were less likely to test for coronavirus than those from national level (adjusted OR=0.31, 95% CI:0.16-0.60). About one-third (31.3%) of the respondents strongly agreed that the policy responses that the Government had taken to contain the spread of coronavirus were reasonable, and 38.5% agreed with the policy responses.

ConclusionsThe findings showed higher social distancing and preventive practices among the government employees in response to COVID-19. People should properly apply social distancing measures, wearing facemasks, and washing hands frequently with water and soap as a comprehensive package of SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control strategies. Rules and regulations imposed by the Government should be properly enforced in order to control the pandemic.",Wakgari Deressa; Alemayehu Worku; Workeabeba Abebe; Sefonias Getachew; Wondwosson Amogne,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248271,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248271,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
286,Efficacy and Safety of Indomethacin in Covid -19 patients,"BackgroundIndomethacin, a well-known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has in addition broad spectrum anti-viral activity in the laboratory including on SARS-Cov-2 virus. This trial is to observe the likelihood of efficacy and safety of Indomethacin in treating RT-PCR positive Covid patients

Materials and MethodsThe study was done in two groups. In the first group of the study, where mild and moderate patients were involved, Propensity Score Matching was used as a methodology to compare Indomethacin and paracetamol based treatments in addition to the standard protocol for treating covid-19 patients.. Blood chemistry was collected before and after the treatment. The patients were monitored every day for clinical parameters. In this part, a patient developing hypoxia was the end point. In the second group, severe patients admitted with hypoxia were treated with Indomethacin in addition to Remdesivir, and the end point was the requirement of mechanical ventilation/admission to ICU.

ResultsIt was observed that patients treated with Indomethacin had a reduction in the number of days to become afebrile, reduction in cough and myalgia by half compared to the paracetamol set. Only one out of 72 patients in the Indomethacin arm of the first group required supplementary oxygen while 28 of the 72 patients required supplementary oxygen in the paracetamol arm. No one in the second group deteriorated enough to require mechanical ventilation. There wea no evidence of adverse reaction to indomethacin or deterioration of renal or liver function.

ConclusionIndomethacin, along with standard care, seems to provide faster symptomatic relief and prevent progression of pneumonia in Covid-19 patients.

287,Uncertainty reduction in logistic regressions: a COVID-19 case-study using surrogate locations' asymptotic values,"Logistic regressions are subject to high uncertainty when the data are not past the inflection point. For example, for logistic regressions estimated with data up to or before inflection point, uncertainties in the upper asymptotic value K can be of the same order of magnitude of the population under analysis. This paper presents a method for uncertainty reduction in logistic regression using data from a surrogate logistic process. We illustrate the procedure using the Richards growth function (Generalized Logistic Function) to make predictions for COVID-19 evolution in Brazilian cities at stages before and during their epidemic inflection points. We constrain the logistic function regression with K calculated from selected surrogate international cities where the epidemic is clearly past its inflection point. Information gained with this constraint stabilizes the logistic regression, reducing the uncertainty in the curves parameters, including the rate of growth at the inflection point. The uncertainty is reduced even when the actual surrogate K is used just as an anchor to simulate different epidemic scenarios. Results predicted for COVID-19 trajectories within Brazil agree with actual data. These results suggest that in the absence of big data, a simple logistic regression may provide low uncertainty if surrogate cities have been identified for estimates of K, even if the specifics of the evolution in the surrogate cities are different. The method may be used for other logistic models and for other logistic processes in other areas such as economics and biology, if surrogate processes can be identified.",Bruno Hebling Vieira; Nathalia Hanna Hiar; George Cunha Cardoso,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248184,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248184,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
288,IMPACT OF A SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE,"ObjectiveThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread across the world causing a dramatic number of infections and deaths. No data are available about the effects of an infection in patients affected by celiac disease (CD) in terms of the development of related symptoms and antibodies. We aimed to investigate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in celiac patients.

DesignDuring a lockdown, the celiac patients living in the Milan area were contacted and interviewed about the development of COVID-19 symptoms as well as adherence to an anti-virus lifestyle and a gluten-free diet (GFD). They were also given a stress questionnaire to fill in. The development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (anti-RBD and N proteins) and the expression of the duodenal ACE2 receptor were investigated. When available, duodenal histology, anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTGA), presence of immunologic comorbidities and adherence to the GFD were analysed as possible risk factors.

Results362 celiac patients have been interviewed and 42 (11%) presented with COVID-19 symptoms. The presence of symptoms was not influenced by tTGA positivity, presence of duodenal atrophy or adherence to GFD. 37% of the symptomatic patients presented anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (Ig). Globally, 18% of celiac patients showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig vs 25% of the non-celiac control (p=0.18). The values of anti-RBD IgG/IgA and anti-N IgG did not differ from the non-celiac controls. Celiac patients had a significant lower level of anti-N IgA. The ACE2 receptor was detected in the non-atrophic duodenal mucosa of celiac patients; atrophy was associated with a lower expression of the ACE2 receptor.

ConclusionCD patients have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig positiveness and profile similar to non-celiac controls, except for anti-N IgA. The main celiac parameters and adherence to the GFD do not influence the development of a different Ig profile.

What is already known about this subject?The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread across the world causing infections and deaths. little is known about the possible relationship between autoimmune comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, and nothing it known about celiac disease.

What are the new findings?In a large cohort of celiac patients living in a high SARS-CoV-2 incidence area in Northern Italy, no difference was observed evidenced in terms of the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig and their IgG and IgA profile compared with the normal population

289,Mental and social health of children and adolescents with pre-existing mental or somatic problems during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 lockdown increases psychological problems in children and adolescents from the general population. Here we investigate the mental and social health during the COVID-19 lockdown in children and adolescents with pre-existing mental or somatic problems.

MethodWe included participants (8-18 years) from a psychiatric (N = 249) and pediatric (N = 90) sample, and compared them to a general population sample (N = 844). Measures were assessed during the first lockdown (April-May 2020) in the Netherlands. Main outcome measures were Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) domains: Global Health, Peer Relationships, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Anger, and Sleep-Related Impairment. Additionally, socio-demographic variables, COVID-19-related questions, changes in atmosphere at home from a parent and child perspective, and childrens experiences of lockdown regulations were assessed.

ResultsOn all measures except Global Health, the pediatric sample reported least problems. The psychiatric sample reported significantly more problems than the general population sample on all measures except for Anxiety and Peer Relationships. Having a COVID-19 affected friend/relative and a COVID-19 related change in work situation negatively moderated outcome, but not in the samples with pre-existing problems. All parents reported significant decreases in atmosphere at home, as did children from the general population.

ConclusionWe observed significant differences in mental and social health between three child and adolescent samples during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and identified COVID-19-related factors influencing mental and social health.

290,It makes you realise your own mortality: A qualitative study on mental health of older adults in the UK during COVID-19,"BackgroundOlder adults have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with high fatalities and health complications reported. Adults over the age of 70 in the UK were advised to self-isolate for 3 months early during the pandemic and it is unclear which factors influenced their experiences during this time.

ObjectiveThe aim of this qualitative study was to explore factors that threatened and protected the wellbeing of older adults living in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsWe undertook semi-structured interviews with 20 adults aged over 70. Purposive sampling methods were used to increase diversity within the group. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsParticipants were aged 72-93, 9 women and 11 men, 80% were White British, 40% lived alone. We identified 2 superordinate themes, including (1) Threats to wellbeing: mortality concerns, grief and loss of normal life, restricted health service access, COVID-19 concerns, and restricted access to activities that protect wellbeing. (2) Factors protective of wellbeing: slower pace of life, maintaining routine, socialising, and use of past coping skills. Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs.

ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that while older adults experienced challenges, many were resilient against COVID-19 restrictions despite early concerns of mental health consequences.

291,Risk of Stress/Depression and Functional Impairment in Denmark Immediately Following a COVID-19 Shutdown,"BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-April 2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative sample of adult individuals in Denmark, and whether the impact of lockdown was heterogeneous across living situation.

MethodsUsing a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n=2,836) and again in July 2020 (n=1,526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture wellbeing and functioning. Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well to answers in re-interviews in July.

ResultsWe find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home. Measures of functional impairment also decline immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home. Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July, but depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July.

Deep classification models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), require large-scale datasets in order to be trained and perform properly. Since the number of X-ray samples related to COVID-19 is limited, transfer learning (TL) appears as the go-to method to alleviate the demand for training data and develop accurate automated diagnosis models. In this context, networks are able to gain knowledge from pretrained networks on large-scale image datasets or alternative data-rich sources (i.e. bacterial and viral pneumonia radiographs).

294,Development of a Rapid Point-Of-Care Test that Measures Neutralizing Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"As increasing numbers of people recover from and are vaccinated against COVID-19, tests are needed to measure levels of protective, neutralizing antibodies longitudinally to help determine duration of immunity. We developed a lateral flow assay (LFA) that measures levels of neutralizing antibodies in plasma, serum or whole blood. The LFA is based on the principle that neutralizing antibodies inhibit binding of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The test classifies high levels of neutralizing antibodies in sera that were titered using authentic SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotype neutralization assays with an accuracy of 98%. Sera obtained from patients with seasonal coronavirus did not prevent RBD from binding to ACE2. As a demonstration for convalescent plasma therapy, we measured conversion of non-immune plasma into strongly neutralizing plasma. This is the first report of a neutralizing antibody test that is rapid, highly portable and relatively inexpensive that might be useful in assessing COVID-19 vaccine immunity.",Douglas F.

295,Diagnostic accuracy of Loop mediated isothermal amplification coupled to Nanopore sequencing for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection at scale in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations,"IntroductionRapid, high throughput diagnostics are a valuable tool, allowing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in populations, in order to identify and isolate people with asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Reagent shortages and restricted access to high throughput testing solutions have limited the effectiveness of conventional assays such as reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), particularly throughout the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the use of LamPORE, where loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is coupled to nanopore sequencing technology, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations.

MethodsIn an asymptomatic prospective cohort, for three weeks in September 2020 health care workers across four sites (Birmingham, Southampton, Basingstoke and Manchester) self-swabbed with nasopharyngeal swabs weekly and supplied a saliva specimen daily. These samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Oxford Nanopore LamPORE system and a reference RT-qPCR assay on extracted sample RNA. A second retrospective cohort of 848 patients with influenza like illness from March 2020 - June 2020, were similarly tested from nasopharyngeal swabs.

ResultsIn the asymptomatic cohort a total of 1200 participants supplied 23,427 samples (3,966 swab, 19,461 saliva) over a three-week period. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection using LamPORE was 0.95%. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of LamPORE was >99.5% in both swab and saliva asymptomatic samples when compared to the reference RT-qPCR test. In the retrospective symptomatic cohort, the incidence was 13.4% and the sensitivity and specificity were 100%.

296,Predicting the need for escalation of care or death from repeated daily clinical observations and laboratory results in patients with SARS-CoV-2 during 2020: a retrospective population-based cohort study from the United Kingdom,"ObjectivesCurrently used prognostic tools for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are based on clinical and laboratory parameters measured at a single point in time, usually on admission. We aimed to determine how dynamic changes in clinical and laboratory parameters relate to SARS-CoV-2 prognosis.

Designretrospective, observational cohort study using routinely collected clinical data to model the dynamic change in prognosis of SARS-CoV-2.

Settinga single, large hospital in England.

Participantsall patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admitted to Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, UK from 1st February 2020 until 30th November 2020.

Main outcome measuresIntensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, death and discharge from hospital.

Statistical MethodsWe split patients into 1st (admissions until 30th June) and 2nd (admissions thereafter) waves. We incorporated all clinical observations, blood tests and other covariates from electronic patient records and follow up until death or 30 days from the point of hospital discharge. We modelled daily risk of admission to ICU or death with a time varying Cox proportional hazards model.

Results2,964 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included. Of 1,374 admitted during the 1st wave, 593 were eligible for ICU escalation, and 466 had near complete ascertainment of all covariates at admission. Our validation sample included 1,590 confirmed cases, of whom 958 were eligible for ICU admission. Our model had good discrimination of daily need for ICU admission or death (C statistic = 0.87 (IQR 0.85-0.90)) and predicted this daily prognosis better than previously published scores (NEWS2, ISCARIC 4C). In validation in the 2nd wave the score overestimated escalation (calibration slope 0.55), whilst retaining a linear relationship and good discrimination (C statistic = 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 -0.95)).

ConclusionsA bespoke SARS-CoV-2 escalation risk prediction score can predict need for clinical escalation better than a generic early warning score or a single estimation of risk at admission.

What is already known on this topicSARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged viral infection, which presents typically with flu like symptoms, can have severe sequelae and has caused a pandemic during 2020.

A number of risk factors for poor outcomes including obesity, age and comorbidity have been recognized.

Risk scores have been developed to stratify risk of poor outcome for patients with SARS-CoV-2 at admission, but these do not take account of dynamic changes in severity of disease on a daily basis.

What this study addsWe have developed a dynamic risk score to predict escalation to ICU or death within the next 24 hours.

Our score has good discrimination between those who will and not require ICU admission (or die) in both our derivation and validation cohorts.

297,Shared genetic etiology between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19 severity,"BackgroundIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex lung disease, characterized by progressive lung scarring. Severe COVID-19 is associated with substantial pneumonitis and has a number of shared major risk factors with IPF. This study aimed to determine the genetic correlation between IPF and severe COVID-19 and assess a potential causal role of genetically increased risk of IPF on COVID-19 severity.

MethodsWe performed a Mendelian randomisation (MR) study for IPF causality in COVID-19. Genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility (P<5x10-8) in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables (IVs). Effect estimates of those IVs on COVID-19 severity were gathered from the GWAS meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. The genetic correlation between IPF and COVID-19 severity was estimated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression.

FindingsWe detected a positive genetic correlation of IPF with COVID-19 severity (rg=0.31 [95% CI 0.04-0.57], P = 0.023). The MR estimates for severe COVID-19 did not reveal any genetic association (OR 1.05, [95% CI 0.92-1.20], P = 0.43). However, outlier analysis revealed that the IPF risk allele rs35705950 at MUC5B had a different effect compared with the other variants. When rs35705950 was excluded, MR results provided evidence that genetically increased risk of IPF has a causal effect on COVID-19 severity (OR 1.21, [95% CI 1.06-1.38], P = 4.24x10-3). Furthermore, the IPF risk-allele at MUC5B showed an apparent protective effect against COVID-19 hospitalization only in older adults (OR 0.86, [95% CI 0.73-1.00], P = 2.99x10-2).

InterpretationThe strongest genetic determinant of IPF, rs35705950 at MUC5B, seems to confer protection against COVID-19, whereas the combined effect of all other IPF risk loci seem to confer risk of COVID-19 severity. The observed effect of rs35705950 could either be due to protective effects of mucin over-production on the airways or a consequence of selection bias due to a patient group that is heavily enriched for the rs35705950 T undertaking strict self-isolation. Due to the diverse impact of IPF causal variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection, further investigation is needed to address this apparent paradox between variance at MUC5B and other IPF genetic risk factors.

298,Characteristics and Risk Factors for Hospitalization and Mortality among Persons with COVID-19 in Atlanta Metropolitan Area,"BackgroundWe present data on risk factors for severe outcomes among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the southeast United States (U.S.).

ObjectiveTo determine risk factors associated with hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality among patients with confirmed COVID-19.

DesignA retrospective cohort study.

SettingFulton County in Atlanta Metropolitan Area, Georgia, U.S.

PatientsCommunity-based individuals of all ages that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

MeasurementsDemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, hospitalization, ICU admission, death (all-cause mortality), and severe COVID-19 disease, defined as a composite measure of hospitalization and death.

ResultsBetween March 2 and May 31, 2020, we included 4322 individuals with various COVID-19 outcomes. In a multivariable logistic regression random-effects model, patients in age groups [&ge;]45 years compared to those <25 years were associated with severe COVID-19. Males compared to females (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.6), non-Hispanic blacks (aOR 1.9, 95%CI: 1.5-2.4) and Hispanics (aOR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.5) compared to non-Hispanic whites were associated with increased odds of severe COVID-19. Those with chronic renal disease (aOR 3.6, 95%CI: 2.2-5.8), neurologic disease (aOR 2.8, 95%CI: 1.8-4.3), diabetes (aOR 2.0, 95%CI: 1.5-2.7), chronic lung disease (aOR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.3), and ""other chronic diseases"" (aOR 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3-2.6) compared to those without these conditions were associated with increased odds of having severe COVID-19.

ConclusionsMultiple risk factors for hospitalization, ICU admission, and death were observed in this cohort from an urban setting in the southeast U.S. Improved screening and early, intensive treatment for persons with identified risk factors is urgently needed to reduce COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality.",Nathaniel Chishinga; Neel R.

300,Cyclic gallium-68 labeled peptides for specific detection of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,"In this study, we developed ACE2-specific, peptide-derived 68Ga-labeled radiotracers, motivated by the hypotheses that (1) ACE2 is an important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and (2) that modulation of ACE2 in COVID-19 drives severe organ injury.

MethodsA series of NOTA-conjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity. Since DX600 bears two cystine residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied. An ACE2 inhibition assay was used to identify lead compounds, which were labeled with 68Ga to generate peptide radiotracers ([68Ga]NOTA-PEP). The aminocaproate-derived radiotracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic model.

ResultsCyclic DX-600 derived peptides had markedly lower IC50s than their linear counterparts. The three cyclic peptides with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers had calculated IC50s similar to, or lower than the parent DX600 molecule. Peptides were readily labeled with 68Ga, and the biodistribution of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was determined in a hACE2 transgenic murine cohort. Pharmacologic concentrations of co-administered NOTA-PEP (""blocking"") showed significant reduction of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 signals in the in the heart, liver, lungs, and small intestine. Ex vivo hACE2 activity in these organs was confirmed as a correlate to in vivo results.

ConclusionsNOTA-conjugated, cyclic peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 retain their activity when N-conjugated for 68Ga chelation. In vivo studies in a transgenic hACE2 murine model using the lead tracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 showed specific binding in the heart, liver, lungs and intestine - organs known to be affected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 could be used to detect organ-specific suppression of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected murine models and COVID-19 patients.

301,Choice of assemblers has a critical impact on de novo assembly of SARS-CoV-2 genome and characterizing variants,"BackgroundCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic following its initial emergence in China. Using next-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes are being sequenced at an unprecedented rate and being deposited in public repositories. For the de novo assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a myriad of assemblers is being used, although their impact on the assembly quality has not been characterized for this virus. In this study, we aim to understand the variabilities on assembly qualities due to the choice of the assemblers.

ResultsWe performed 6,648 de novo assemblies of 416 SARS-CoV-2 samples using 8 different assemblers with different k-mers. We used Illumina paired-end sequencing reads and compared the genome assembly quality to that of different assemblers. We showed the choice of assemblers plays a significant role in reconstructing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Two metagenomic assemblers e.g. MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes performed better compared to others in most of the assembly quality metrics including, recovery of a larger fraction of the genome, constructing larger contigs and higher N50, NA50 values etc. We showed that at least 09% (259/2,873) of the variants present in the assemblies between MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes are unique to the assembly methods.

ConclusionOur analyses indicate the critical role of assembly methods for assembling SARS-CoV-2 genome using short reads and their impact on variant characterization. This study could help guide future studies to determine which assembler is best suited for the de novo assembly of virus genomes.",Rashedul Islam; Rajan Saha Raju; Nazia Tasnim; Md.

302,Identification of inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro enzymatic activity using a small molecule in-vitro repurposing screen,"Compound repurposing is an important strategy for the identification of effective treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL-Pro), also termed M-Pro, is an attractive drug target as it plays a central role in viral replication by processing the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at multiple distinct cleavage sites. We here report the results of a repurposing program involving 8.7 K compounds containing marketed drugs, clinical and preclinical candidates, and small molecules regarded as safe in humans. We confirmed previously reported inhibitors of 3CL-Pro, and have identified 62 additional compounds with IC50 values below 1 M and profiled their selectivity towards Chymotrypsin and 3CL-Pro from the MERS virus. A subset of 8 inhibitors showed anti-cytopathic effect in a Vero-E6 cell line and the compounds thioguanosine and MG-132 were analysed for their predicted binding characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro. The X-ray crystal structure of the complex of myricetin and SARS-Cov-2 3CL-Pro was solved at a resolution of 1.77 [A], showing that myricetin is covalently bound to the catalytic Cys145 and therefore inhibiting its enzymatic activity.

303,Detection of long SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid sequences in peripheral blood monocytes collected soon after hospital admission,"Many different viruses infect circulating mononuclear cells to disseminate infection to diverse organs. Blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are being intensively studied as immunologic and pathologic responders to the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus (CoV19) but direct evidence showing CoV19 in these cells has not been published. PBMC myeloid cells that take up residence in various organs can harbor viral genomes for many years in lymphatic tissues, skin and brain, and act as a source for re-infection and/or post-viral organ pathology. To test if PBMC from acutely ill hospitalized patients contain viral nucleic acids, we first analyzed a standard short CoV19 nucleocapsid (NC) 72bp sequence. Because NC proteins protect the viral genome, we further analyzed longer (301nt) adjacent NC stretches by RNA/qPCR. In 2 of 11 patient PBMC, but no uninfected controls, longer NC sequences were positive as early as 2-6 days after hospital admission and were validated by sequencing. The presence of longer NC sequences indicates pathogenic fragments, or possibly the complete infectious virus, are carried by a rare population of monocytes, probably a subset of myeloid migratory cells. Predictably, such cells carried CoV19 to heart and brain with consequent late post-viral immune pathologies that are now evident.",Nathan Pagano; Maudry Laurent-Rolle; Jack Chunchieh Hsu; - Yale IMPACT Research Team; Chantal BF Vogels; Nathan D Grubaugh; Laura Manuelidis,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.423113,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.423113,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,False
304,Niclosamide inhibits SARS-CoV2 entry by blocking internalization through pH-dependent CLIC/GEEC endocytic pathway,"Many viruses utilize the host endo-lysosomal network to infect cells. Tracing the endocytic itinerary of SARS-CoV2 can provide insights into viral trafficking and aid in designing new therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV2 is internalized via the clathrin and dynamin-independent, pH-dependent CLIC/GEEC (CG) endocytic pathway. Endosomal acidification inhibitors like BafilomycinA1 and NH4Cl, which inhibit the CG pathway, strongly block the uptake of RBD. Using transduction assays with SARS-CoV2 Spike-pseudovirus, we confirmed that these acidification inhibitors also impede viral infection. By contrast, Chloroquine neither affects RBD uptake nor extensively alters the endosomal pH, yet attenuates Spike-pseudovirus entry, indicating a pH-independent mechanism of intervention. We screened a subset of FDA-approved acidification inhibitors and found Niclosamide to be a potential SARS-CoV2 entry inhibitor. Niclosamide, thus, could provide broader applicability in subverting infection of similar category viruses entering host cells via this pH-dependent endocytic pathway.",Chaitra Prabhakara; Rashmi Godbole; Parijat Sil; Sowmya Jahnavi; Thomas S van Zanten; Dhruv Sheth; Neeraja Subhash; Anchal Chandra; Vijay Kumar Nuthakki; Theja Parassini Puthiyapurayil; Riyaz Ahmed; Ashaq Hussain Najar; Sai Manoz Lingamallu; Snigdhadev Das; Bhagyashri Mahajan; Praveen Kumar Vemula; Sandip B Bharate; Parvinder Pal Singh; Ram Vishwakarma; Arjun Guha; Varadharajan Sundaramurthy; Satyajit Mayor,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.422529,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.422529,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,False

306,One Year of SARS-CoV-2: How Much Has the Virus Changed?,"SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has caused a world-wide crisis with profound effects on both healthcare and the economy. In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, research groups have shared viral genome sequence data through the GISAID initiative. We collected and computationally profiled [~]223,000 full SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences from GISAID over one year for emergent nonsynonymous mutations. Our analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mutating at substantially different rates, with most viral proteins exhibiting little mutational variability. As anticipated, our calculations capture previously reported mutations occurred in the first period of the pandemic, such as D614G (Spike), P323L (NSP12), and R203K/G204R (Nucleocapsid), but also identify recent mutations like A222V and L18F (Spike) and A220V (Nucleocapsid). Our comprehensive temporal and geographical analyses show two periods with different mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome: December 2019 to June 2020 and July to November 2020. Some mutation rates differ also by geography; the main mutations in the second period occurred in Europe. Furthermore, our structure-based molecular analysis provides an exhaustive assessment of mutations in the context of 3D protein structure.

307,"The effectiveness of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions in reducing the outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK, an observational and modelling study.","Epidemiological models used to inform government policies aimed to contain the contagion of COVID-19, assume that the reproduction rate is reduced through Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) leading to physical distancing. Available data in the UK show an increase in physical distancing before the NPIs were implemented and a fall soon after implementation. We aimed to estimate the effect of peoples behaviour on the epidemic curve and the effect of NPIs taking into account this behavioural component. We have estimated the effects of confirmed daily cases on physical distancing and we used this insight to design a bevavioural SEIR model (BeSEIR), simulated different scenaria regarding NPIs and compared the results to the standard SEIR. Taking into account behavioural insights improves the description of the contagion dynamics of the epidemic significantly. The BeSEIR predictions regarding the number of infections without NPIs were several orders of magnitude less than the SEIR. However, the BeSEIR prediction showed that early measures would still have an important influence in the reduction of infections. The BeSEIR model shows that even with no intervention the percentage of the cumulative infections within a year will not be enough for the epidemic to resolve due to a herd immunity effect. On the other hand, a standard SEIR model significantly overestimates the effectiveness of measures. Without taking into account the behavioural component the epidemic is predicted to be resolved much sooner than when taking it into account.",Giorgos Galanis; Corrado Di Guilmi; David L.

308,A safe protocol to identify low risk patients with COVID-19 pneumonia for outpatient management,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has made necessary to rationalize health-care resources, but there are no published data to this moment regarding ambulatory management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

ObjectiveEvaluate the results of a protocol for ambulatory management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia according to the rate of readmissions, admission into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and deaths. Identify unfavorable prognostic factors that increase the risk of readmission, ICU admission and/or death.

MethodsProspective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged from the emergency ward of Infanta Cristina Hospital (Madrid, Spain), that met the criteria of the hospital protocol for outpatient management. We describe outcomes of those patients and compare those who needed readmission versus those we did not. We use logistic regression to explore factors associated with readmissions.

Findings314 patients were included, of which 20 (6.4%) needed readmission, 3 (1%) developed severe respiratory failure, and none needed ICU admission nor died. 29.9% of patients had any one comorbidity. Hypertension, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased aminotransferases were associated to a higher risk of readmission. A clinical course of 10 days or longer, and an absolute eosinophil count over 200/{micro}L were associated with a lower risk. After multivariate analysis, only hypertension (OR 4.99, CI 1.54-16.02), temperature over 38{degrees}C in the emergency ward (OR 9.03, CI: 1.89-45.77), leukopenia (OR 4.92, CI 1.42-17.11) and increased LDH (OR 6.62, CI 2.82-19.26) remained significantly associated to readmission.

ConclusionOutpatient management of patients with low-risk COVID-19 pneumonia is safe, if adequately selected. The protocol presented here has allowed avoiding 30% of the admissions for COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital, with a very low readmission rate and non-existing mortality.

309,The association between work situation and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic: prospective cohort study in Norway,"ObjectivesTo analyse the population effects on life quality of being laid off from work, having to work from home, or having been diagnosed with COVID-19.

DesignNationwide population-based cohort study.

SettingNorway.

ParticipantsWe followed more than 80,000 participants in an ongoing cohort study, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed current life satisfaction in April and again in September/October 2020 for subjects whose work situation and infection status had changed.

Main outcome measuresSelf-reported satisfaction with life, using a scale from 0 (worst) to 10 (best).

ResultsTemporary and permanent layoffs, working from a home-based office, and getting a COVID-19 diagnosis were associated with modestly, but significantly lower concurrent life satisfaction, both on a population level and for subjects who changed status. The associations with change in work situation were stronger for men. For men with permanent job loss, the adjusted odds ratio for low life satisfaction (<6) was 3.2 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.2) in April and 4.9 (95% CI 3.5 to 6.9) in autumn. A suspected or confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with an adjusted odds ratio for low life satisfaction of 1.9 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.3) in spring. The strength of associations between work situation and life satisfaction did not vary much across socio-economic strata, but layoffs were more common among those with low education.

ConclusionLayoffs, home office and infection status had clear impact on the quality of life as measured with a global life satisfaction scale. These findings suggest that social differentials in quality of life, are increasing during the pandemic.

FundingThis work was funded by the Norwegian Research Councils Centres of Excellence Funding Scheme (no. 262700) and by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH).

SUMMARY BOXESO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABS- Being laid off from work or having to work from a home-based office is usually associated with reduced life quality.
- The population effect has not been estimated during the present surge in cases of COVID-19 in Europe.


What this study adds- This population-based study shows that life satisfaction in Norway has been stable from the first to the second wave of the pandemic, but that both layoffs and working from home is associated with reduced life satisfaction, especially among men.
- The reduced life satisfaction in people working from a home-based office implies that large proportions of the population are affected.",Ellen Oen Carlsen; Ida Henriette Caspersen; Helga Ask; Ragnhild Eek Brandlistuen; Lill Trogstad; Per Magnus,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248321,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248321,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
310,The role of metabolic comorbidity in COVID-19 mortality of middle-aged adults. The case of Mexico.,"BackgroundIn contrast to developed countries, in Mexico more than half of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in adults <65-years-old, with at least a million years of life lost to premature mortality (YLL) in eight months. Mexico has a young population but a high prevalence of metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes that contribute to COVID-19 adverse outcomes. COVID-19 could be particularly risky in population with specific comorbidity combinations that havent been analyzed.

MethodsTo explore what contributes to the high COVID-19 mortality in Mexican middle-aged adults, we calculated age-stratified COVID-19 case fatality rates, YLL and relative risk (RR) of 9 comorbidities and 23 comorbidity combinations in a retrospective Mexican cohort with 905,579 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases/89,167 deaths, until Nov/2/2020.

FindingsChronic kidney disease (CKD) had the highest RR for COVID-19 fatality, followed by diabetes and immunosuppression, that in turn had higher RR than obesity or hypertension as single comorbidities. The combination diabetes/hypertension with or without obesity had RR as high as CKD as a single comorbidity (>3 in <60-year-olds). Notably, the RR of comorbidities decreased with age, tending to values near 1 after age 60; suggesting that in Mexico, comorbidities increase COVID-19 fatality mostly in young and middle-aged adults. Our analysis suggests that advanced metabolic disease, marked by multimorbidity (more than one chronic disease per individual) or diabetes before age 60, contribute particularly to the younger age of COVID-19 fatalities in Mexico. Around 38% of YLL to COVID-19, were attributable to the synergy between COVID-19 and pre-existing diseases, mainly combinations between obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Yet, [1/4] of deaths and 1/3 of YLL have occurred in individuals without known comorbidities.

ConclusionsThe Mexican COVID-19 outbreak illustrates that middle-aged adults 45-64-yo can have high COVID-19 mortality during large outbreaks, especially if they present chronic metabolic comorbidities, but also in their absence, making them an important group of concern after elders. COVID-19 mortality in middle-aged adults is likely proportional to the gradual decline in health that accompanies ageing, which presents earlier in poorer populations that also get more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and have less access to specialized medical attention.",Lenin Dominguez-Ramirez; Francisco Rodriguez-Perez; Francisca Sosa-Jurado; Gerardo Santos-Lopez; Paulina Cortes-Hernandez,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20244160,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20244160,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
311,"The impact of working during the Covid-19 pandemic on health care workers and first responders: mental health, function, and professional retention","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected front line health care workers (HCW) and first responders (FR). The infection risk from SARS CoV-2, the high mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the duration of the pandemic have created sustained and often traumatic stressors affecting HCW and FR.

ObjectivesTo assess the relationship of COVID-19 stressor frequency scores to psychiatric rating scale scores amongst HCW and FR. To determine if psychiatric rating scale scores mediate stressor effects on perceived work function and likelihood of remaining in current occupation.

DesignObservational, self-report in a convenience sample.

Participants118 HCW and FR caring for COVID-19 patients in the United States.

Main MeasureCOVID-19 related stressor frequencies were assessed using a 17-item questionnaire. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL5), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (for depression) (PHQ9), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7).

Key ResultsStressor frequency scores correlated significantly with PCL5 scores (R=.57, p<1e-8), PHQ scores (R=.35, P<.001), ISI scores (R=.38, p<1e-4), and GAD7 scores (R=.39, p<.001), likelihood of staying in current occupation (R=-.39,p<1e-4), and trouble doing usual work (R=.33,p<.001). 51% of HCW and 44% of FR indicated decreased likelihood of staying in their current occupation. PCL5 scores substantially mediated the association between stress frequency scores and work function impairment.

ConclusionsThese results direct attention to recognizing potentially treatable psychiatric symptoms, particularly those of PTSD, in HCW and FR experiencing COVID-19 related stressors. They also suggest that mitigating COVID-19 related stressors when possible, such as by providing adequate personal protective equipment, can improve HCW and FR mental health, work function and retention in the health care work force.

312,Assessing the Safety of Home Oximetry for Covid-19: A multi-site retrospective observational study.,"ObjectivesTo determine the safety and effectiveness of home oximetry monitoring pathways safe for Covid-19 patients in the English NHS

DesignThis was a retrospective, multi-site, observational study of home oximetry monitoring for patients with suspected or proven Covid-19

SettingThis study analysed patient data from four Covid-19 home oximetry pilot sites in North West London, Slough, South Tees and Watford across primary and secondary care settings.

Participants1338 participants were enrolled in a home oximetry programme at one of the four pilot sites. Participants were excluded if primary care data and oxygen saturations are rest at enrolment were not available. 908 participants were included in the analysis.

InterventionsHome oximetry monitoring was provided to participants with a known or suspected diagnosis of Covid-19. Participants were enrolled following attendance to accident and emergency departments, hospital admission or referral through primary care services.

ResultsOf 908 patients enrolled into four different Covid-19 home oximetry programmes in England, 771 (84.9%) had oxygen saturations at rest of 95% or more, and 320 (35.2%) were under 65 years of age and without comorbidities. 52 (5.7%) presented to hospital and 28 (3.1%) died following enrolment, of which 14 (50%) had Covid-19 as a named cause of death. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients enrolled after admission to hospital (OR 8.70, 95% CI: 2.5 - 29.9), compared to those enrolled in primary care, Patients enrolled after hospital discharge (OR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15 - 0.68) or emergency department presentation (OR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20 - 0.89) were significantly less likely to present to hospital after enrolment than those enrolled in primary care.

ConclusionsThis study find that home oximetry monitoring can be a safe pathway for Covid-19 patients; and indicates increases in risk to vulnerable groups and patients with oxygen saturations < 95% at enrolment, and in those enrolled on discharge from hospital. Findings from this evaluation have contributed to the national implementation of home oximetry across England, and further work will be undertaken to evaluate clinical effectiveness of the new pathway.

313,Stress perceived by students of the medical sciences in Cuba toward the COVID-19 pandemic: results of an online survey,"IntroductionThe aims of this study were to determine the usefulness of the Modified (10-items) Scale of Perceived Stress related to COVID-19 (EEP-10-C by its acronym in Spanish) and to identify the levels of stress perceived by students of the medical sciences in Cuba toward the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted, with self-reported data of students from fourteen Cuban Universities of Medical Sciences (n = 200), through an online survey. The EEP-10-C was used as an instrument to identify stress. Its validity was determined through a confirmatory factor analysis and its internal consistency and reliability was measured by the Cronbach alph. A cluster analysis was performed to establish as cut-off point the center of the cluster with the highest values of stress perceived by the scale.

ResultsThe average age of the sample was 23.30 {+/-} 1.91 years, with observed scores of the EEP-10-C between 0 and 29 points (13.25 {+/-} 5,404). When applying the cut-off point [&ge;]25, only two students had high rates of stress perceived. The confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the instrument; with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.755. The cutoff point [&ge;]20 was proposed as a reference of high stress perceived for the study population, when applying this one, 14% of students presented high rates of stress.

DiscussionIn Cuba, students of the medical sciences have participated in research and supporting health care, despite which they have presented low levels of stress. The main contribution of the research was the validation of the EEP-10-C for its use in assessing levels of stress in Cuban medical students, proposing the cut-off point [&ge;]20 as a reference of high stress perceived.",Frank Hernandez-Garcia; Onelis Gongora-Gomez; Victor Ernesto Gonzalez-Velazquez; Elys Maria Pedraza-Rodriguez; Rolando Zamora-Fung; Luis Alberto Lazo Herrera,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248345,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248345,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True
314,"Patient characteristics, clinical care, resource use, and outcomes associated with hospitalization for COVID-19 in the Toronto area","BackgroundPatient characteristics, clinical care, resource use, and outcomes associated with hospitalization for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Canada are not well described.

MethodsWe described all adult discharges from inpatient medical services and medical-surgical intensive care units (ICU) between November 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 at 7 hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario. We compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19, influenza and all other conditions using multivariable regression models controlling for patient age, sex, comorbidity, and residence in long-term-care.

ResultsThere were 43,462 discharges in the study period, including 1,027 (3.0%) with COVID-19 and 783 (2.3%) with influenza. Patients with COVID-19 had similar age to patients with influenza and other conditions (median age 65 years vs. 68 years and 68 years, respectively, SD<0.1). Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (59.1%) and 11.7% were long-term care residents. Patients younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all admissions for COVID-19 and 24.0% of ICU admissions. Compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater mortality (unadjusted 19.9% vs 6.1%, aRR: 3.47, 95%CI: 2.57, 4.67), ICU use (unadjusted 26.4% vs 18.0%, aRR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.27, 1.83) and hospital length-of-stay (unadjusted median 8.7 days vs 4.8 days, aRR: 1.40, 95%CI: 1.20, 1.64), and not significantly different 30-day readmission (unadjusted 8.6% vs 8.2%, aRR: 1.01, 95%CI: 0.72, 1.42).

315,Pooling for SARS-CoV2 Surveillance: Validation and Strategy for Implementation in K-12 Schools,"Repeated testing of a population is critical for limiting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the safe reopening of educational institutions such as K-12 schools and colleges. Many screening efforts utilize the CDC RT-PCR based assay which targets two regions of the novel Coronavirus nucleocapsid gene. The standard approach of testing each person individually, however, poses a financial burden to these institutions and is therefore a barrier to using testing for re-opening. Pooling samples from multiple individuals into a single test is an attractive alternate approach that promises significant cost savings - however the of specificity and sensitivity of such approaches needs to be assessed prior to deployment. To this end, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of analyzing samples in pools of eight by the established RT-PCR assay. Participants (1,576) were recruited from amongst the Tufts University community undergoing regular screening. Each volunteer provided two swabs, one analyzed separately and the other in a pool of eight. Because the positivity rate was very low, we spiked approximately half of the pools with laboratory-generated swabs produced from known positive cases outside the Tufts testing program. The results of pooled tests had 100% correspondence with those of their respective individual tests. We conclude that pooling eight samples does not negatively impact the specificity or sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay and suggest that his approach can be utilized by institutions seeking to reduce surveillance costs.",Alexandra Marie Simas; Jimmy Walter Crott; Chris Sedore; Augusta Rohrbach; Anthony P Monaco; Stacey B Gabriel; Niall Lennon; Brendan Blumenstiel; Caroline Attardo Genco,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248353,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20248353,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,,True

Follow-up PCR and antibody tests showed that most of these cases were not true COVID-19 infection but instead arose from reverse-transcribed and amplified viral sequences (amplicons) that are generated during research. Environmental testing showed widespread contamination of amplicons in lab spaces including notebooks, keyboards, glasses, and doorknobs. Minimizing instances of amplicon contamination and developing protocols for handling suspected cases are critical to propel research efforts and to avoid diverting university and healthcare resources from patients with COVID-19.

317,Does Contact Tracing Work? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from an Excel Error in England,"Contact tracing has been a central pillar of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, contact tracing measures face substantive challenges in practice and well-identified evidence about their effectiveness remains scarce. This paper exploits quasi-random variation in COVID-19 contact tracing. Between September 25 and October 2, 2020, a total of 15,841 COVID-19 cases in England (around 15 to 20% of all cases) were not immediately referred to the contact tracing system due to a data processing error. Case information had been truncated from an Excel spreadsheet due to a row limit, which was discovered on October 3. There is substantial variation in the degree to which different parts of England areas were exposed - by chance - to delayed referrals of COVID-19 cases to to the contact tracing system. We show that more affected areas subsequently experienced a drastic rise in new COVID-19 infections and deaths alongside an increase in the positivity rate and the number of test performed, as well as a decline in the performance of the contact tracing system. Conservative estimates suggest that the failure of timely contact tracing due to the data glitch is associated with more than 125,000 additional infections and over 1,500 additional COVID-19-related deaths. Our findings provide strong quasi-experimental evidence for the effectiveness of contact tracing.",Thiemo Fetzer; Thomas Graeber,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247080,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247080,2020-12-15,2020-12-15,,True
318,Foistar(Camostat mesylate) associated with the significant decrease in CRP levels compared to Kaletra(Lopinavir/Ritonavir) treatment in Korean mild COVID-19 pneumonic patients.,"BackgroundThere is limited information due to absence of virus titer and symptom related changes. Nonetheless, this is the first comparative study between the use of Foistar (Camostat mesilate) and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) on COVID-19 infection.

MethodsPatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing that were admitted to Seoul Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) where is the largest public medical center in South Korea between August 1 and September 20, 2020 were included

The data of the patients with pneumonia who received Foistar (Foistar group) during their hospitalization period were primarily collected, and the patients who received Kaletra (Kaletra group) during their hospitalization period were matched to have a similar age group to that of Foistar group so that three times the number of Foistar group patients were randomly selected into Kaletra group and their body temperature, CRP level, WBC count, and event of diarrhea were collected, accordingly.

ResultsA total of 29 patients (7 Foistar group and 22 Kaletra group) was included. The median age was 69, and all had mild COVID-19 (WHO ordinal scale 3 or 4) on admission. 6 patients out of 7 patients (85.71%) from Foistar group who exhibited elevated CRP levels (CRP >0.4mg/dL) on admission have controlled their CRP levels to the normal range. In Kaletra group, 11 out of 18 patients (61.11%) have controlled their CRP levels to the normal range, and only 1 of 2 patients (50.00%) who had normal CRP level has maintained his or her normal CRP level. The difference in the white blood cell counts was not significant between two groups. None of the patients in the study had hyperkalemia.

ConclusionThis study has found a probable association of controlling inflammatory reactions and fever in COVID-19 patients with Foistar (camostat mesilate) use. In addition, there was no significant adverse drug event found from this study upon the Foistar use. These results may encourage the use of Foistar as a treatment option for the patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.",Jae-Phil Choi; Jae-Phil Choi; Hyoung-Jun Kim; Jumi Han; Sujung Park; JinJoo Han,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20240689,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20240689,2020-12-15,2020-12-15,,True
319,"Safety and immunogenicity trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-BBV152: a phase 1, double-blind, randomised control trial","BackgroundBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a TLR 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG).

MethodsWe conducted a double-blind randomized controlled phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152. A total of 375 participants were randomized equally to receive three vaccine formulations (n=100 each) prepared with 3 g with Algel-IMDG, 6 g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 g with Algel, and an Algel only control arm (n=75). Vaccines were administered on a two-dose intramuscular accelerated schedule on day 0 (baseline) and day 14. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. The secondary outcomes were immunogenicity based on the anti-IgG S1 response (detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and wild-type virus neutralization [microneutralization and plaque reduction neutralization assays]). Cell-mediated responses were also evaluated.

ResultsReactogenicity was absent in the majority of participants, with mild events. The majority of adverse events were mild and were resolved. One serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be unrelated to vaccination. All three vaccine formulations resulted in robust immune responses comparable to a panel of convalescent serum. No significant differences were observed between the 3-g and 6-g Algel-IMDG groups. Neutralizing responses to homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains were detected in all vaccinated individuals. Cell-mediated responses were biased to a Th-1 phenotype.

ConclusionsBBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses and with the inclusion of the Algel-IMDG adjuvant, this is the first inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been reported to induce a Th1-biased response. Vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers were reported with two divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains. BBV152 is stored between 2{degrees}C and 8{degrees}C, which is compatible with all national immunization program cold chain requirements. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for the phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are underway.

In this paper, we describe a multicentre, retrospective, observational study to describe the course of SARS-CoV-2 disease in patients treated with ImmunoFormulation (IF), an add-on therapy developed to decrease duration of clinical symptoms. In parallel, a group of patients that did not receive IF was used for comparison (using standard of care treatment). A total of 39 patients were evaluated. Throughout the observational period, 90% of patients recovered in the IF cohort and 47.4% in the Control cohort (p=0.0057). From the symptoms with statistically significant differences, the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time to recover from it) was shorter in the IF cohort than in control cohort (in days, average), especially for fever (2.25 x 21.78), dry cough (4.38 x 24.00), dyspnoea (3.67 x 20.00), headache (2.00 x 26.50), diarrhoea (5.25 x 25.25), and weakness (1.92 x 23.30).

322,Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection and Classification Using Phase Imaging with Computational Specificity,"Efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis revealed that fast, accurate, and scalable testing is crucial for curbing the current impact and that of future pandemics. We propose an optical method for directly imaging unlabeled viral particles and using deep learning for detection and classification. An ultrasensitive interferometric method was used to image four virus types with nanoscale optical pathlength sensitivity. Pairing these data with fluorescence images for ground truth, we trained semantic segmentation models based on U-Net, a particular type of convolutional neural network. The trained network was applied to classify the viruses from the interferometric images only, containing simultaneously SARS-CoV-2, H1N1 (influenza-A), HAdV (adenovirus), and ZIKV (Zika). Remarkably, due to the nanoscale sensitivity in the input data, the neural network was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 vs. the other viruses with 96% accuracy. The inference time for each image is 60 ms, on a common graphic processing unit. This approach of directly imaging unlabeled viral particles may provide an extremely fast test, of less than a minute per patient. As the imaging instrument operates on regular glass slides, we envision this method as potentially testing on patient breath condensates.

The necessary high throughput can be achieved by translating concepts from digital pathology, where a microscope can scan hundreds of slides automatically.

Current in vivo methods to identify PPIs between a novel virus and humans are slow, costly, and difficult to cover the vast interaction space. We propose a novel deep learning architecture designed for in silico PPI prediction and a transfer learning approach to predict interactions between novel virus proteins and human proteins.

324,A blueprint for high affinity SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors from activity-based compound library screening guided by analysis of protein dynamics,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide. The main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-COVID-19 agents. Unfortunately, unexpected difficulties have been encountered in the design of specific inhibitors. Here, by analyzing an ensemble of ~30,000 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro conformations from crystallographic studies and molecular simulations, we show that small structural variations in the binding site dramatically impact ligand binding properties. Hence, traditional druggability indices fail to adequately discriminate between highly and poorly druggable conformations of the binding site. By performing ~200 virtual screenings of compound libraries on selected protein structures, we redefine the proteins druggability as the consensus chemical space arising from the multiple conformations of the binding site formed upon ligand binding. This procedure revealed a unique SARS-CoV-2 Mpro blueprint that led to a definition of a specific structure-based pharmacophore. The latter explains the poor transferability of potent SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, despite the identical sequences of the active sites. Importantly, application of the pharmacophore predicted novel high affinity inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, that were validated by in vitro assays performed here and by a newly solved X-ray crystal structure. These results provide a strong basis for effective rational drug design campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and a new computational approach to screen protein targets with malleable binding sites.",Jonas Goßen; Simone Albani; Anton Hanke; Benjamin P.

325,Potent SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralization through maturation of iconic SARS-CoV-1 antibodies,"Antibodies against coronavirus spike protein potently protect against infection and disease, however it remains unclear if such protection can be extended to variant coronaviruses. This is exemplified by a set of iconic and well-characterized monoclonal antibodies developed after the 2003 SARS outbreak including mAbs m396, CR3022, CR3014 and 80R, which potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1, but not SARS-CoV-2. Here we explore antibody maturation strategies to change and broaden their specificity, enabling potent binding and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Using targeted mutagenesis as well as light chain shuffling on phage, we identified variants with considerably increased affinity and neutralization potential. The most potent antibody, derived from the NIH-developed mAb m396, neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 virus with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 160 ng/ml. Intriguingly, while many of the matured clones maintained specificity of the parental antibody, new specificities were also observed, which was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, indicating that a limited set of antibodies can give rise to variants targeting diverse epitopes.

MethodsWe downloaded 75 genomes sequences of clinical SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID (global initiative on sharing all influenza data) database and we comprehensively analyzed these SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequences alongside with Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 sequences as the reference strains.

ResultsWe analyzed 75 genomes sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in different African countries including 10 samples of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Rwanda between July and August 2020. The phylogenetic analysis of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 revealed a strong identity with reference strains between 90-95%. We identified a missense mutation in four proteins including orf1ab polyprotein, NSP2, 2-O-ribose methyltransferase and orf1a polyprotein. The most common changes in the base are C > T. We also found that all clinically SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Rwanda had genomes belonging to clade G and lineage B.1.

ConclusionsTracking the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time is important to understand viral evolution pathogenesis. These findings may help to implement public health measures in curbing COVID-19 in Rwanda.",Nzungize Lambert; Ndishimye Pacifique; Fathiah Zakham,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422793,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422793,2020-12-15,2020-12-15,,False
328,"Azithromycin in Hospitalised Patients with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","BackgroundAzithromycin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of its immunomodulatory actions. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once daily by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or one of the other treatment arms). Patients were twice as likely to be randomised to usual care as to any of the active treatment groups. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsBetween 7 April and 27 November 2020, 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5182 patients to receive usual care alone. Overall, 496 (19%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 997 (19%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1{middle dot}00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0{middle dot}90-1{middle dot}12; p=0{middle dot}99). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. There was no difference in duration of hospitalisation (median 12 days vs. 13 days) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60% vs. 59%; rate ratio 1{middle dot}03; 95% CI 0{middle dot}97-1{middle dot}10; p=0{middle dot}29). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (21% vs. 22%; risk ratio 0{middle dot}97; 95% CI 0{middle dot}89-1{middle dot}07; p=0{middle dot}54).

InterpretationIn patients hospitalised with COVID-19, azithromycin did not provide any clinical benefit. Azithromycin use in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should be restricted to patients where there is a clear antimicrobial indication.

329,"Social Media Study of Public Opinions on Potential COVID-19 Vaccines: Informing Dissent, Disparities, and Dissemination","The current development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented. Little is known, however, about the nuanced public opinions on the coming vaccines. We adopt a human-guided machine learning framework (using more than 40,000 rigorously selected tweets from more than 20,000 distinct Twitter users) to capture public opinions on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifying them into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. We aggregate opinions at the state and country levels, and find that the major changes in the percentages of different opinion groups roughly correspond to the major pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of the pro-vaccine group is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Using multinomial logistic regression, we compare demographics, social capital, income, religious status, political affiliations, geo-locations, sentiment of personal pandemic experience and non-pandemic experience, and county-level pandemic severity perception of these three groups to investigate the scope and causes of public opinions on vaccines. We find that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more likely to hold polarized opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines. The anti-vaccine opinion is the strongest among the people who have the worst personal pandemic experience. Next, by conducting counterfactual analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned about the safety, effectiveness, and political issues regarding potential vaccines for COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience increases the vaccine acceptance level. We believe this is the first large-scale social media-based study to analyze public opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines that can inform more effective vaccine distribution policies and strategies.",Hanjia Lyu; Junda Wang; Wei Wu; Viet Duong; Xiyang Zhang; Timothy D.

331,Changes in cardiovascular disease monitoring in English primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational cohort study,"ObjectiveTo quantify the impact and recovery in cardiovascular disease monitoring in primary care associated with the first COVID-19 lockdown.

DesignRetrospective nationwide primary care cohort study, utilising data from 1st January 2018 to 27th September 2020.

SettingWe extracted primary care electronic health records data from 514 primary care practices in England contributing to the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID). These practices were representative of English primary care across urban and non-urban practices.

ParticipantsThe ORCHID database included 6,157,327 active patients during the study period, and 13,938,390 patient years of observation (final date of follow-up 27th September 2020). The mean (SD) age was 38{+/-}24 years, 49.4% were male and the majority were of white ethnicity (65% [21.9% had unknown ethnicity])

ExposureThe primary exposure was the first national lockdown in the UK, starting on 23rd March 2020.

Main outcome measuresRecords of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and International Normalised Ratio (INR) measurement derived from coded entries in the primary care electronic health record.

ResultsRates of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and INR recording dropped by 23-87% in the week following the first UK national lockdown, compared with the previous week. The largest decline was seen in cholesterol (IRR 0.13, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.15) and smallest for INR (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.81).

Following the immediate drop, rates of recorded tests increased on average by 5-9% per week until 27th September 2020. However, the number of recorded measures remained below that expected for the time of year, reaching 51.8% (95% CI 51.8 to 51.9%) for blood pressure, 63.7%, (95% CI 63.7% to 63.8%) for cholesterol measurement and 70.3% (95% CI 70.2% to 70.4%) for HbA1c. Rates of INR recording declined throughout the previous two years, a trend that continued after lockdown. There were no differences in the times series trends based on sex, age, ethnicity or deprivation.

ConclusionsCardiovascular disease monitoring in English primary care declined substantially from the time of the first UK lockdown. Despite a consistent recovery in activity, there is still a substantial shortfall in the numbers of recorded measurements to those expected.

332,Treatment provision for adults with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic: An exploratory study on patient and therapist experience with on-site sessions using face masks vs. telepsychiatric sessions,"BackgroundMaintaining the therapeutic care of psychiatric patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland required changes to the way in which sessions were conducted, such as telepsychiatric interventions or the use of face masks during on-site sessions. While little is known about how face masks affect the therapeutic experience of patients and therapists, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry is well documented for several psychiatric disorders. However, research on the benefits of telepsychiatry in adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains scarce. This seems problematic since the symptoms typically associated with ADHD, such as attention problems and distractibility, may lessen the utility of telepsychiatry for this particular group. The present studys aim was to explore how adult patients with ADHD and their therapists experienced therapy sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic in three different settings: face-to-face with the therapist wearing a face mask, via telephone, or via videoconferencing.

MethodsIn this exploratory, quantitatively driven mixed-method study (quantitative questionnaire data and qualitative data from open-ended responses), we assessed patients evaluation of the session, their treatment satisfaction, and patients and therapists ratings of therapeutic alliance. We also collected qualitative comments on both sides experience of the session. Overall, 97 therapist and 66 patient questionnaires were completed. Results are reported for the N = 60 cases for which data from both parties were available. Sequential multiple regressions adjusted for therapist and number of sessions were used for the main quantitative analyses.

ResultsTelepsychiatric sessions were rated as significantly less deep than face-to-face sessions, an effect that was mainly driven by lower ratings in the videoconferencing group and, as suggested by further analyses, may decline over time. No other statistically significant differences were observed. Elements that were mentioned as facilitating or complicating a session differed markedly between patients and therapists.

ConclusionsBoth settings, on-site with the therapist wearing a face mask and telepsychiatric, seem to be valid options to continue treatment of adults with ADHD during a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Aspects such as patient preference, session content, and therapeutic methods may be useful to identify the most suitable modality.",Helen Wyler; Michael Liebrenz; Vladeta Ajdacic-Gross; Erich Seifritz; Susan Young; Pascal Burger; Anna Buadze,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20242511,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20242511,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
333,Self-harm presentations to Emergency Departments and Place of Safety during the first wave of the UK COVID-19 pandemic: South London and Maudsley data on service use from February to June 2020.,"The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on both mental health service delivery, and the ways in which people are accessing these services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for around 1.2m residents in South London) have highlighted increased use of virtual contacts by mental health teams, with dropping numbers of face-to-face contacts over the first wave of the pandemic. There has been concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to higher mental health emergencies, particularly instances of self-harm. However, with people advised to stay at home during the  first wave lockdown, it is as yet unclear whether this impacted mental health service presentations. Taking advantage of SLaMs Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with daily updates of information from its electronic mental health records, this paper describes overall presentations to Emergency Department (ED) mental health liaison teams, and those with self-harm. The paper focussed on three periods: i) a pre-lockdown period 1st February to 15th March, ii) a lockdown period 16th March to 10th May and iii) a post-lockdown period 11th May to 28th June. In summary, all attendances to EDs for mental health support decreased during the lockdown period, including those with self-harm. All types of self-harm decreased during lockdown, with self-poisoning remaining the most common. Attendances to EDs for mental health support increased post-lockdown, although were only just approaching pre-lockdown levels by the end of June 2020.",Eleanor Nuzum; Evangelia Martin; Gemma Morgan; Rina Dutta; Christoph Mueller; Catherine Polling; Megan Pritchard; Sumithra Velupillai; Robert Stewart,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247155,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247155,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
334,"The seroprevalence and trends of SARS-CoV-2 in Delhi, India: A repeated population-based seroepidemiological study","BackgroundThree rounds of a repeated cross-sectional serosurvey to estimate the seroprevalence and trends of SARS-CoV-2 were conducted from August-October 2020 in the state of Delhi in India in the general population aged [&ge;]5 years.

MethodsThe selection of participants was through a multi-stage sampling design from all the 11 districts and 280 wards of the city-state, with two-stage allocation proportional to population- size. Household selected was via systematic random sampling, and individual participant selection through the age-order procedure. The blood samples were screened using the IgG ELISA COVID-Kawach kit (August Round), and the ERBALISA COVID-19 IgG (September and October) rounds. The seroprevalence was estimated by applying the sampling weights based on age and sex with further adjustment for the assay-kit characteristics.

ResultsA total of 4267 (n=15046), 4311 (n=17409), and 3829 (n=15015) positive tests indicative of the presence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 were observed during the August, September, and October 2020 serosurvey rounds, respectively. The adjusted seroprevalence declined from 28.39% (95% CI 27.65-29.14) (August) to 24.08% (95% CI 23.43-24.74) (September), and 24.71% (95% CI 24.01, 25.42%) (October). The antibody positivity was highest in the [&ge;]50 and female age-group during all rounds of the serosurvey, while the decline was maximum among the younger age-group (5-17 years). On adjusted analysis, participants with lower per capita income, living in slums or overcrowded households, and those with diabetes comorbidity had significantly higher statistical odds of antibody positivity.

ConclusionsDespite high IgG seroprevalence, there was evidence for waning of antibody positivity with the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, implying a potential reduction in population immunity, especially if also associated with the lack of trained T cell immunity.",Nandini Sharma; Pragya Sharma; Saurav Basu; Sonal Saxena; Rohit Chawla; Kumar Dushyant; Nutan Mundeja; Z SK Marak; Sanjay Singh; Gautam Kumar Singh; Ruchir Rustagi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248123,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248123,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
335,Identifying Synergistic Interventions to Address COVID-19 Using a Large Scale Agent-Based Model,"There is a range of public health tools and interventions to address the global pandemic of COVID-19. Although it is essential for public health efforts to comprehensively identify which interventions have the largest impact on preventing new cases, most of the modeling studies that support such decision-making efforts have only considered a very small set of interventions. In addition, previous studies predominantly considered interventions as independent or examined a single scenario in which every possible intervention was applied. Reality has been more nuanced, as a subset of all possible interventions may be in effect for a given time period, in a given place. In this paper, we use cloud-based simulations and a previously published Agent-Based Model of COVID-19 (Covasim) to measure the individual and interacting contribution of interventions on reducing new infections in the US over 6 months. Simulated interventions include face masks, working remotely, stay-at-home orders, testing, contact tracing, and quarantining. Through a factorial design of experiments, we find that mask wearing together with transitioning to remote work/schooling has the largest impact. Having sufficient capacity to immediately and effectively perform contact tracing has a smaller contribution, primarily via interacting effects.",Philippe J.

The aim of this review is (i) to synthesise the evidence on risk of infection and transmission among migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced populations, and (ii) the effect of lockdown measures on these populations. We searched MEDLINE and WOS, preprint servers, and pertinent websites between 1st December 2019 and 26th June 2020.

337,COVID-19 vaccines that reduce symptoms but do not block infection need higher coverage and faster rollout to achieve population impact,"BackgroundSeveral COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in the final stage of testing. Interim trial results for two vaccines suggest at least 90% efficacy against symptomatic disease (VEDIS). It remains unknown whether this efficacy is mediated predominately by lowering SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility (VESUSC) or development of symptoms after infection (VESYMP). A vaccine with high VESYMP but low VESUSC has uncertain population impact.

MethodsWe developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to demographic, physical distancing and epidemic data from King County, Washington. Different rollout scenarios starting December 2020 were simulated assuming different combinations of VESUSC and VESYMP resulting in up to 100% VEDIS with constant vaccine effects over 1 year. We assumed no further increase in physical distancing despite expanding case numbers and no reduction of infectivity upon infection conditional on presence of symptoms. Proportions of cumulative infections, hospitalizations and deaths prevented over 1 year from vaccination start are reported.

ResultsRollouts of 1M vaccinations (5,000 daily) using vaccines with 50% VEDIS are projected to prevent 30%-58% of infections and 38%-58% of deaths over one year. In comparison, vaccines with 90% VEDIS are projected to prevent 47%-78% of the infections and 58%-77% of deaths over one year. In both cases, there is a greater reduction if VEDIS is mediated mostly by VESUSC. The use of a ""symptom reducing"" vaccine will require twice as many people vaccinated than a ""susceptibility reducing"" vaccine with the same 90% VEDIS to prevent 50% of the infections and death over one year. Delaying the start of the vaccination by 3 months decreases the expected population impact by approximately 40%.

ConclusionsVaccines which prevent COVID-19 disease but not SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thereby shift symptomatic infections to asymptomatic infections, will prevent fewer infections and require larger and faster vaccination rollouts to have population impact, compared to vaccines that reduce susceptibility to infection. If uncontrolled transmission across the U.S. continues, then expected vaccination in Spring 2021 will provide only limited benefit.",David A Swan; Chloe Bracis; Holly Janes; Mia Moore; Laura Matrajt; Daniel B Reeves; Eileen Burns; Deborah Donnell; Myron S Cohen; Joshua Schiffer; Dobromir T Dimitrov,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248142,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248142,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
338,Association of Mortality and Aspirin Prescription for COVID-19 Patients at the Veterans Health Administration,"There is growing evidence that thrombotic and inflammatory pathways contribute to the severity of COVID-19. Common medications such as aspirin, that mitigate these pathways, may decrease COVID-19 mortality. This assessment was designed to quantify the correlation between aspirin and mortality for COVID-19 positive patients in our care. Data from the Veterans Health Administration national electronic health record database was utilized for the evaluation. Veterans from across the country with a first positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction lab result were included in the evaluation which comprised 28,350 patients from March 2, 2020 to September 13, 2020 for the 14-day mortality cohort and 26,346 patients from March 2, 2020 to August 28, 2020 for the 30-day mortality cohort. Patients were matched via propensity scores and the odds of mortality were then compared. Among COVID-19 positive Veterans, preexisting aspirin prescription was associated with a statistically and clinically significant decrease in overall mortality at 14-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.46) and at 30-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.33-0.45), cutting the odds of mortality by more than half.

We examined mortality records from January 2015 to October 2020 from government sources at Jakarta, Indonesia: 1) burials in public cemeteries; 2) civil death registration; and 3) health authority death registration. During 2015-2019, an average of 26,342 burials occurred each year from January to October. During the same period of 2020, there were 42,460 burials, an excess of 61%. Burial activities began surging in early January 2020, two months before the first official laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Indonesia in March 2020. Analysis of civil death registrations or health authority death registration showed insensitive trends during 2020. Burial records indicated substantially increased mortality associated with the onset of and ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Jakarta and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission may have been initiated and progressing at least two months prior to official detection.

340,Predicting mortality in SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) positive patients in the inpatient setting using a Novel Deep Neural Network,"BackgroundThe second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to be worse than the initial one and will strain the healthcare systems even more during the winter months. Our aim was to develop a machine learning-based model to predict mortality using the deep learning Neo-V framework. We hypothesized this novel machine learning approach could be applied to COVID-19 patients to predict mortality successfully with high accuracy.

MethodsThe current Deep-Neo-V model is built on our previously statistically rigorous machine learning framework [Fahad-Liaqat-Ahmad Intensive Machine (FLAIM) framework] that evaluated statistically significant risk factors, generated new combined variables and then supply these risk factors to deep neural network to predict mortality in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients in the inpatient setting. We analyzed adult patients ([&ge;]18 years) admitted to the Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan with a working diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (n=1228). We excluded patients that were negative on COVID-19 on RT-PCR, had incomplete or missing health records. The first phase selection of risk factor was done using Cox-regression univariate and multivariate analyses. In the second phase, we generated new variables and tested those statistically significant for mortality and in the third and final phase we applied deep neural networks and other traditional machine learning models like Decision Tree Model, k-nearest neighbor models and others.

ResultsA total of 1228 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 infection, we excluded 14 patients after the exclusion criteria and (n=)1214 patients were analyzed. We observed that several clinical and laboratory-based variables were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analyses while others were not. With most significant being septic shock (hazard ratio [HR], 4.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91-6.37), supportive treatment (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 2.01-6.14), abnormal international normalized ratio (INR) (HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 2.28-4.63), admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 2.22-4.74), treatment with invasive ventilation (HR, 3.21; 95% CI, 2.15-4.79) and laboratory lymphocytic derangement (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.6-4.86). Machine learning results showed our DNN (Neo-V) model outperformed all conventional machine learning models with test set accuracy of 99.53%, sensitivity of 89.87%, and specificity of 95.63%; positive predictive value, 50.00%; negative predictive value, 91.05%; and area under the curve of the receiver-operator curve of 88.5.

341,"Human Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of a Novel Broad-Spectrum Oral Antiviral Compound, Molnupiravir, with Activity Against SARS-CoV-2","Molnupiravir, EIDD-2801/MK-4482, the prodrug of the ribonucleoside analog {beta}-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), has activity against a number of RNA viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus.

Single and multiple doses of molnupiravir were evaluated in this first-in-human, phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, which included evaluation of the effect of food on pharmacokinetics.

EIDD-1931 appeared rapidly in plasma, with a median time of maximum observed concentration of 1.00 to 1.75 hours, and declined with a geometric half-life of approximately 1 hour, with a slower elimination phase apparent following multiple doses or higher single doses (7.1 hours at the highest dose tested). Mean maximum observed concentration and area under the concentration versus time curve increased in a dose-proportional manner, and there was no accumulation following multiple doses. When administered in a fed state, there was a decrease in the rate of absorption, but no decrease in overall exposure.

Molnupiravir was well tolerated. Fewer than half of subjects reported an adverse event, the incidence of adverse events was higher following administration of placebo, and 93.3% of adverse events were mild. One discontinued early due to rash. There were no serious adverse events and there were no clinically significant findings in clinical laboratory, vital signs, or electrocardiography. Plasma exposures exceeded expected efficacious doses based on scaling from animal models; therefore, dose escalations were discontinued before a maximum tolerated dose was reached.

342,Decay of Fc-dependent antibody functions after mild to moderate COVID-19,"The capacity of antibodies to engage with innate and adaptive immune cells via the Fc region is important in preventing and controlling many infectious diseases, and is likely critical in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evolution of such antibodies during convalescence from COVID-19 is largely unknown. We developed novel assays to measure Fc-dependent antibody functions against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-expressing cells in serial samples from a cohort of 53 subjects primarily with mild-moderate COVID-19, out to a maximum of 149 days post-infection. We found that S-specific antibodies capable of engaging dimeric Fc{gamma}RIIa and Fc{gamma}RIIIa decayed linearly over time. S-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) activity within plasma declined linearly as well, in line with the decay of S-specific IgG. Although there was significant decay in S-specific plasma ADCC and ADP activity, they remained readily detectable by all assays in 94% of our cohort at the last timepoint studied, in contrast with neutralisation activity which was only detectable in 70% of our cohort by the last timepoint. Our results suggest that Fc effector functions such as ADCC and ADP could contribute to the durability of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, particularly late in convalescence when neutralising antibodies have waned. Understanding the protective potential of antibody Fc effector functions is critical for defining the durability of immunity generated by infection or vaccination.",Wen Shi Lee; Kevin John Selva; Samantha K Davis; Bruce D Wines; Arnold Reynaldi; Robyn Esterbauer; Hannah G Kelly; Ebene R Haycroft; Hyon-Xhi Tan; Jennifer A Juno; Adam K Wheatley; P Mark Hogarth; Deborah Cromer; Miles P Davenport; Amy W Chung; Stephen J Kent,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248143,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248143,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
343,"A rapid, high-sensitivity SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid immunoassay to aid diagnosis of acute COVID-19 at the point of care","BackgroundThe LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, which uses a high-sensitivity, microfluidic immunoassay to detect the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, was evaluated for diagnosing acute COVID-19 in adults and children across point-of-care settings.

MethodsTwo paired anterior nasal swabs or two paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each participant. Swabs were tested by the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and compared with real-time PCR (rt-PCR; Roche cobas 6800 platform). Positive- and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results stratified based on gender, age, duration of symptoms, and rt-PCR cycle threshold.

ResultsOut of the 512 participants, aged 0-90 years, of this prospective validation study, 414 (81%) were symptomatic for COVID-19 and 123 (24%) swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on rt-PCR testing. Compared with rt-PCR, the 12-minute swab test had 97.6% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity within 12 days of symptom onset, representing the period of infectivity. All (100%) samples detected within 33 rt-PCR cycles were also identified using the antigen test. Results were consistent across age and gender. Despite being performed by minimally trained healthcare workers, the user error rate of the test system was 1%.

ConclusionThe rapid high-sensitivity assay using nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal sampling may offer significant improvements for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinic- and community-based settings.

344,Public Preferences for Social Distancing Behaviors to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19: A Discrete Choice Experiment,"Policies to promote social distancing can minimize COVID-19 transmission, but come with substantial social and economic costs. Quantifying relative preferences of the public for such practices can inform policy prioritization and optimize uptake. We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to quantify relative ""utilities"" (preferences) for five COVID-19 pandemic social distances strategies (e.g., closure of restaurants, restriction of large gatherings) against the hypothetical risk of acquiring COVID-19 and anticipated income loss. The survey was distributed in Missouri in May-June, 2020. We applied inverse probability sampling weights to mixed logit and latent class models to generate mean preferences and identify preference classes. Overall (n=2,428), the strongest preference was for the prohibition of large gatherings, followed by preferences to keep outdoor venues, schools, and social and lifestyle venues open, 75% of the population showing probable support for a strategy that prohibited large gatherings and closed lifestyle and social venues. Latent class analysis, however revealed four preference sub-groups in the population - ""risk eliminators"", ""risk balancers"", ""altruistic"" and ""risk takers"", with men twice as likely as women to belong to the risk-taking group. In this setting, public health policies which as a first phase prohibit large gatherings, as well as close social and lifestyle venues may be acceptable and adhered to by the public. In addition, policy messages that address preference heterogeneity, for example by targeting public health messages at men, could improve adherence to social distancing measures and prevent further COVID-19 transmission prior to vaccine distribution and in the event of future pandemics.

Significance StatementPreferences drive behavior - DCEs are a novel tool in public health that allow examination of preferences for a product, service or policy, identifying how the public prioritizes personal risks and cost in relation to health behaviors. Using this method to establish preferences for COVID-19 mitigation strategies, our results suggest that, firstly, a tiered approach to non-essential business closures where large gatherings are prohibited and social and lifestyle venues are closed as a first phase, would be well aligned with population preferences and may be supported by the public, while school and outdoor venue closures may require more consideration prior to a second phase of restrictions. And secondly, that important distinct preference phenotypes - that are not captured by sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex, race) characteristics - exist, and therefore that messaging should be target at such subgroups to enhance adherence to prevention efforts.",Ingrid Eshun-Wilson; Aaloke Mody; Virginia McKay; Matifadza Hlatshwayo; Cory Bradley; Vetta Thompson; David Glidden; Elvin H Geng,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.20248103,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.20248103,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True

Under this scope, deep learning techniques have received even more attention as an asset to automatically detect patients infected by COVID-19 and reduce the doctors burden to manually assess medical imagery. Thus, this work considers a deep learning architecture that fuses the layers of current-state-of-the-art deep networks to produce a new structure-fused deep network. The advantages of our deep network fusion scheme are multifold, and ultimately afford an appealing COVID-19 automatic diagnosis that outbalances current deep learning methods.

346,Estimation of COVID-19 risk-stratified epidemiological parameters and policy implications for Los Angeles County through an integrated risk and stochastic epidemiological model,"SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSHealth disparities have emerged with the COVID-19 epidemic because the risk of exposure to infection and the prevalence of risk factors for severe outcomes given infection vary within and between populations. However, estimated epidemic quantities such as rates of severe illness and death, the case fatality rate (CFR), and infection fatality rate (IFR), are often expressed in terms of aggregated population-level estimates due to the lack of epidemiological data at the refined subpopulation level. For public health policy makers to better address the pandemic, stratified estimates are necessary to investigate the potential outcomes of policy scenarios targeting specific subpopulations.

MethodsWe develop a framework for using available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors (age, comorbidities, BMI, smoking status) in subpopulations, and epidemic dynamics at the population level and stratified by age, to estimate subpopulation-stratified probabilities of severe illness and the CFR (as deaths over observed infections) and IFR (as deaths over estimated total infections) across risk profiles representing all combinations of risk factors including age, comorbidities, obesity class, and smoking status. A dynamic epidemic model is integrated with a relative risk model to produce time-varying subpopulation-stratified estimates. The integrated model is used to analyze dynamic outcomes and parameters by population and subpopulation, and to simulate alternate policy scenarios that protect specific at-risk subpopulations or modify the population-wide transmission rate. The model is calibrated to data from the Los Angeles County population during the period March 1 - October 15 2020.

FindingsWe estimate a rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13,0.33) of infections observed before April 15, which increased over the epidemic course to 0.41 (0.11,0.69). Overall population-average IFR(t) estimates for LAC peaked at 0.77% (0.38%,1.15%) on May 15 and decreased to 0.55% (0.24%,0.90%) by October 15. The population-average IFR(t) stratified by age group varied extensively across subprofiles representing each combination of the additional risk factors considered (comorbidities, BMI, smoking). We found median IFRs ranging from 0.009%-0.04% in the youngest age group (0-19), from 0.1%-1.8% for those aged 20-44, 0.36%-4.3% for those aged 45-64, and 1.02%-5.42% for those aged 65+. In the group aged 65+ for which the rate of unobserved infections is likely much lower, we find median CFRs in the range 4.4%-23.45%. The initial societal lockdown period avoided overwhelming healthcare capacity and greatly reduced the observed death count. In comparative scenario analysis, alternative policies in which the population-wide transmission rate is reduced to a moderate and sustainable level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would not have been sufficient to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity, and additionally would have exceeded the observed death count. Combining the moderate NPI policy with stringent protection of the at-risk subpopulation of individuals 65+ would have resulted in a death count similar to observed levels, but hospital counts would have approached capacity limits.

InterpretationThe risk of severe illness and death of COVID-19 varies tremendously across subpopulations and over time, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for the entire population and epidemic time period. This includes variation not only across age groups, but also within age categories combined with other risk factors analyzed in this study (comorbidities, obesity status, smoking). In the policy analysis accounting for differences in IFR across risk groups in comparing the control of infections and protection of higher risk groups, we find that the strict initial lockdown period in LAC was effective because it both reduced overall transmission and protected individuals at greater risk, resulting in preventing both healthcare overload and deaths. While similar numbers of deaths as observed in LAC could have been achieved with a more moderate NPI policy combined with greater protection of individuals 65+, this would have come at the expense of overwhelming the healthcare system. In anticipation of a continued rise in cases in LAC this winter, policy makers need to consider the trade offs of various policy options on the numbers of the overall population that may become infected, severely ill, and that die when considering policies targeted at subpopulations at greatest risk of transmitting infection and at greatest risk for developing severe outcomes.",Abigail L.

347,COVID-19 TARRACO Cohort Study: Development of a predictive prognostic rule for early assessment of COVID-19 patients in primary care settings.,"PURPOSEClinical course in COVID-19 patients is uncertain. This study investigated possible early prognostic factors among middle-aged and older adult and explored prognostic rules stratifying risk of patients.

METHODSCommunity-based retrospective cohort study that included 282 community-dwelling symptomatic patients [&ge;]50 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (hospitalised and/or outpatient) during March-June 2020 in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Relationship between demographics, pre-existing comorbidities and early symptomatology (first 5-days) and risk of suffering critical outcome (ICU-admission/death) across clinical course was evaluated by logistic regression analyses, and simple predictive models were developed.

RESULTSOf the 282 cases (mean age: 65.9 years; 140 men), 154 (54.6%) were hospitalised (30 ICU-admitted) and 45 (16%) deceased. In crude analyses, increasing age, male sex, some comorbidities (renal, respiratory or cardiac disease, diabetes and hypertension) and symptoms (confusion, dyspnea) were associated with an increased risk to suffer critical outcome, whereas other symptoms (rinorrhea, myalgias, headache, anosmia/disgeusia) were related with reduced risk. After multivariable-adjustment only age/years (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.07; p=0.004), confusion (OR: 5.33; 95% CI: 1.54-18.48; p=0.008), dyspnea (OR: 5.41; 95% CI: 2.74-10.69; p<0.001) and myalgias (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10-0.93; p=0.038) remained significantly associated with increased or reduced risk. A proposed CD65-M prognostic rule (including the above mentioned 4 variables) showed a good correlation with the risk of suffering critical outcome (area under ROC curve: 0.828; 95% CI: 0.774-0.882).

MethodsA cohort of 168 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients enrolled in a prospective observational study at a large European tertiary care center was analyzed.

ResultsForty-four percent (71/161) of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Shorter duration of symptoms before admission (aOR 1.22 per day less, 95%CI 1.10-1.37, p<0.01), age 60-69 as compared to 18-59 years (aOR 4.33, 95%CI 1.07-20.10, p=0.04), and history of hypertension (aOR 5.55, 95%CI 2.00-16.82, p<0.01) were associated with need for IMV. Patients on IMV had higher maximal concentrations, slower decline rates, and longer shedding of SARS-CoV-2 than non-IMV patients (33 days, IQR 26-46.75, vs 18 days, IQR 16-46.75, respectively, p<0.01). Median duration of hospitalization was 9 days (IQR 6-15.5) for non-IMV and 49.5 days (IQR 36.8-82.5) for IMV-patients.

350,Simulation-Based Study on the COVID-19 Airborne Transmission in a Restaurant,"COVID-19 has shown a high potential of transmission via virus-carrying aerosols as supported by growing evidence. However, detailed investigations that draw direct links between aerosol transport and virus infection are still lacking. To fill in the gap, we conducted a systematic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor air flow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airborne infection of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals were widely reported by the media. We employed an advanced in-house large eddy simulation (LES) solver and other cutting-edge numerical methods to resolve complex indoor processes simultaneously, including turbulence, flow-aerosol interplay, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by air conditioners. Using the aerosol exposure index derived from the simulation, we are able to provide a spatial map of the airborne infection risk under different settings. Our results have shown a remarkable direct linkage between regions of high aerosol exposure index and the reported infection patterns in the restaurant, providing strong support to the airborne transmission occurring in this widely-reported incidence. Using flow structure analysis and reverse-time tracing of aerosol trajectories, we are able to further pinpoint the influence of environmental parameters on the infection risks and highlight the needs for more effective preventive measures, e.g., placement of shielding according to the local flow patterns. Our research, thus, has demonstrated the capability and value of high-fidelity CFD tools for airborne infection risk assessment and the development of effective preventive measures.",Han Liu; Sida He; Lian Shen; Jiarong Hong,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247403,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247403,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
351,"CD177, a specific marker of neutrophil activation, is a hallmark of COVID-19 severity and death","COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits wide inter-individual clinical variability, from silent infection to severe disease and death. The identification of high-risk patients is a continuing challenge in routine care. We aimed to identify factors that influence clinical worsening. We analyzed 52 cell populations, 71 analytes, and RNA-seq gene expression in the blood of severe patients from the French COVID cohort upon hospitalization (n = 61). COVID-19 patients showed severe abnormalities of 27 cell populations relative to healthy donors (HDs). Forty-two cytokines, neutrophil chemo-attractants, and inflammatory components were elevated in COVID-19 patients. Supervised gene expression analyses showed differential expression of genes for neutrophil activation, interferon signaling, T- and B-cell receptors, EIF2 signaling, and ICOS-ICOSL pathways in COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised analysis confirmed the prominent role of neutrophil activation, with a high abundance of CD177, a specific neutrophil activation marker. CD177 was the most highly differentially-expressed gene contributing to the clustering of severe patients and its abundance correlated with CD177 protein serum levels. CD177 levels were higher in COVID-19 patients from both the French and ""confirmatory"" Swiss cohort (n = 203) than in HDs (P< 0.01) and in ICU than non-ICU patients (P< 0.001), correlating with the time to symptoms onset (P = 0.002). Longitudinal measurements showed sustained levels of serum CD177 to discriminate between patients with the worst prognosis, leading to death, and those who recovered (P = 0.01).

352,How the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the economics of U.S. emergency care,"ObjectiveWe describe how the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic impacted emergency department (ED) economics, acuity, and staffing.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of visits during January to September 2020 compared to 2019 in 136 EDs staffed by a national emergency medicine group. We created ratios of three-week moving averages for 2020 visits, acuity, costs divided by 2019 moving averages, by age and ED size. We tabulated reductions in clinician hours and FTEs compared to early 2020 staffing.

Results2020-2019 ED visit ratios declined in March nadiring mid-April for both adults (to 0.60) and children (to 0.30) and rose thereafter but remained below 2019 levels through September 2020. The ratio of adult RVUs/visit rose to 1.1 for adults and 1.2 for children in the early pandemic, falling to 1.04 and 1.1 through September. The ratio of direct salary expenses in freestanding (FSED) and small EDs declined less dramatically than in medium and large EDs. Clinical revenues in medium and large EDs declined more sharply and recovered slowly but plateaued well below 2019 levels. By September 2020, expenses were still higher than revenues for small EDs, similar for FSEDs, and somewhat higher for medium and large EDs. During the pandemic, physician hours fell 15% and APP hours 27% during COVID-19 translating to 174 lost physician and 193 lost APP FTEs.

353,Predicting the Peak and COVID-19 trend in six high incidence countries: A study based on Modified SEIRD model,"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has claimed the lives of almost a million people across the globe and this trend continues to rise rapidly day by day. The fear of getting infected by Corona virus is affecting the people emotionally, psychologically and mentally. They are not able to work to their full capacity and are also worried about the well beings of their near and dear ones. The National governments have taken up several measures like lockdowns, closing of educational institutions, and work from home for employees of companies wherever feasible. Governments are also advising people to take precautions like not to go out if not necessary, use of mask and keep a distance of appx. 6 ft. if you need to go out as the virus spreads from human to human in close proximity. These measures have helped to limit the spread of this virus in the past few months. However, due to rapid increase in the daily confirmed cases, it is becoming tougher for the governments to provide facilities like testing kits, hospitalization facilities, oxygen cylinders etc. to the infected persons. Thus, there is an urgent need to accurately estimate the number of cases in coming future that can help governments in acquiring the required resources. Further, to handle the economic distress caused by this virus, long-term planning is equally important. Focusing on these two aspects, this paper proposes to use the Modified SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model to predict the peak and spread trend of COVID-19 in six countries namely USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Peru and Colombia having the highest number of confirmed cases. As in COVID-19, even infected asymptomatic persons can spread the infection, the chosen model is well suited as exposed compartment of SEIRD model includes asymptomatic exposed individuals which are infectious. Epidemiological data till 9th September 2020 has been utilised to perform short-term predictions till 31st December 2020.

354,Are commercial antibody assays substantially underestimating SARS-CoV-2 ever infection? An analysis on a population-based sample in a high exposure setting,"BackgroundPerformance of three automated commercial serological IgG-based assays was investigated for assessing SARS-CoV-2 ever (past or current) infection in a population-based sample in a high exposure setting.

MethodsPCR and serological testing was performed on 394 individuals.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2-IgG seroprevalence was 42.9% (95% CI 38.1%-47.8%), 40.6% (95% CI 35.9%-45.5%), and 42.4% (95% CI 37.6%-47.3%) using the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively. Between the three assays, overall, positive, and negative percent agreements ranged between 93.2%-95.7%, 89.3%-92.8%, and 93.8%-97.8%, respectively; Cohen kappa statistic ranged from 0.86-0.91; and 35 specimens (8.9%) showed discordant results. Among all individuals, 12.5% (95% CI 9.6%-16.1%) had current infection, as assessed by PCR. Of these, only 34.7% (95% CI 22.9%-48.7%) were seropositive by at least one assay. A total of 216 individuals (54.8%; 95% CI 49.9%-59.7%) had evidence of ever infection using antibody testing and/or PCR during or prior to this study. Of these, only 78.2%, 74.1%, and 77.3% were seropositive in the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively.

ConclusionsAll three assays had comparable performance and excellent agreement, but missed at least 20% of individuals with past or current infection. Commercial antibody assays can substantially underestimate ever infection, more so when infection rates are high.",Gheyath K. Nasrallah; Soha R. Dargham; Farah Shurrab; Duaa W.

355,Risk-driven responses to COVID-19 eliminate the tradeoff between lives and livelihoods,"BackgroundResponses to COVID-19 pandemic are conditioned by a perceived tradeoff between saving lives and paying the economic costs of contact-reduction measures. We develop and test the hypothesis that when populations endogenously respond to risk this tradeoff disappears.

MethodsWe develop a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission where populations endogenously reduce contacts in response to risk of death. We estimate the model for 118 countries constituting 7.05 billion people and assess the existence of a tradeoff between saving lives and livelihoods.

ResultsWe show that with endogenous responses communities go through three phases - rapid early outbreaks, control through initial response, and a longer period of quasi-equilibrium endemic infection with effective reproduction number (Re) fluctuating around one. Analytical characterization of this phase shows little tradeoff between contact reduction levels (underpinning economic costs) and death rates. Empirically estimating the model, we find no positive correlation (r = -0.241, p = 0.009) between (log) death rates and (normalized) contact levels across nations. While contact reduction levels are broadly similar across countries (5-95 percentile: 0.521-0.867 of pre-pandemic contacts), expected death rates vary greatly, by over two orders of magnitude (5-95 percentile: 0.03-17 deaths per million per day).

InterpretationWhether by choice or by the force of crippling death tolls, most societies will bring down interactions enough to contain SARS-CoV-2s spread. What we control is the severity of death toll required to compel us to act: greater responsiveness to risk can bring down deaths with no excess economic costs.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe study how endogenous changes in behaviors, in response to risk of death, moderate the tradeoff between deaths and interaction levels in communities exposed to COVID-19 pandemic. We searched for existing models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and how they incorporate changes in policies and behaviours in response to changing risk levels. Most common are the use of time-based changes in basic reproduction number to capture those behavioural responses, or empirically specified policies that have been enacted in response to the epidemic. These methods, while effective for empirical estimation of historical trajectories, do not inform the tradeoff we are seeking to understand. A smaller subset of prior work does include endogenous responses to risk, mostly in the form of policy switches that activate when risk exceeds some threshold, with notable exceptions that include continuous responses potentially more suitable for the study at hand. To our knowledge these prior formalizations do not focus on teasing out the perceived tradeoff between interaction levels in a community and public health burden of the epidemic. Therefore, the powerful intuition that a strong tradeoff exists between saving lives and livelihoods remains unchallenged.

Added value of this studyBy introducing an endogenous and continuous response function connecting perceived risk levels to contact levels, we examine the existence of a tradeoff between contact levels and death rates across communities. We find this extension leads to a long quasi-equilibrium phase during which effective reproduction number remains around 1. During this phase our model predicts little tradeoff between contact reductions (the driver of economic costs) and death rates. We find empirical support for this extension and its predictions using data from 118 countries constituting more than 7 billion people. While countries show limited variation in their estimated contact reduction levels, deaths vary by two orders of magnitude.

Implications of all available evidenceIn a pandemic individuals and communities respond to risk, not only by following government mandates, but also through their personal choices protecting their own and others lives. Formalizing this observation into models of contagion largely eliminates the tradeoff between saving lives and livelihoods in responding to a pandemic. More responsive policies promise to save lives with no additional economic costs compared to weaker response functions.",Hazhir Rahmandad; Tse Yang Lim,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247924,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247924,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
356,Maintenance therapy with infliximab or vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel disease is not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence: UK experience in the 2020 pandemic,"BackgroundThere has been great concern amongst clinicians and patients that immunomodulatory treatments for IBD may increase risk of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or progression to severe disease.

MethodsSera from 640 patients attending for maintenance infliximab or vedolizumab infusions between April and June 2020 at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK) and Royal London Hospital (London, UK) were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Demographic and clinical data were collated from electronic patient records and research databases.

ResultsSeropositivity rates of 3.0% (12/404), 7.2% (13/236), and 12.5% (7/56) were found in the Oxford and London adult IBD cohorts and London paediatric IBD cohorts respectively. Seroprevalence rates in the Oxford adult IBD cohort were lower than that seen in non-patient facing health-care workers within the same hospital (7.2%). Seroprevalence rates of the London paediatric IBD cohort were comparable to a contemporary healthy cohort collected at the same hospital (54/386, 13.6%).

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rates are not elevated in patients with IBD receiving maintenance infliximab or vedolizumab infusions. There is no rationale based on these data for elective interruption of maintenance therapy, and we recommend continuation of maintenance therapy.

357,Modeling of aerosol transmission of airborne pathogens in ICU rooms of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure,"The COVID-19 pandemic has generated many concerns about cross-contamination risks, particularly in hospital settings and Intensive Care Units (ICU). Virus-laden aerosols produced by infected patients can propagate throughout ventilated rooms and put medical personnel entering them at risk. Experimental results found with a schlieren optical method have shown that the air flows generated by a cough and normal breathing were modified by the oxygenation technique used, especially when using High Flow Nasal Canulae, increasing the shedding of potentially infectious airborne particles. This study also uses a 3D Computer Fluid Dynamics model based on a Lattice Boltzmann Method to simulate the air flows as well as the movement of numerous airborne particles produced by a patients cough within an ICU room under negative pressure. The effects of different mitigation scenarii on the amount of aerosols potentially containing SARS-CoV-2 that are extracted through the ventilation system are investigated. Numerical results indicate that adequate bed orientation and additional air treatment unit positioning can increase by 40% the number of particles extracted and decrease by 25% the amount of particles deposited on surfaces 45s after shedding. This approach could help lay the grounds for a more comprehensive way to tackle contamination risks in hospitals, as the model can be seen as a proof of concept and be adapted to any room configuration.",Cyril Crawford; Emmanuel Vanoli; Baptiste Decorde; Maxime Lancelot; Camille Duprat; Christophe Josserand; Jonathan Jilesen; Lila Bouadma; Jean-Francois Timsit,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247551,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247551,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
358,Acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield the vulnerable during the COVID-19 outbreak: a qualitative study in six Sudanese communities,"BackgroundShielding of high-risk groups from coronavirus disease (COVID-19), either within their households or safe communal structures, has been suggested as a realistic alternative to severe movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in low-income countries. To our knowledge, this concept has not been tested or evaluated in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield persons at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, during the COVID-19 epidemic in six communities in Sudan.

MethodsWe purposively sampled participants from six communities, illustrative of urban, rural and forcibly-displaced settings. In-depth telephone interviews were held with 59 members of households with one or more members at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Follow-up interviews were held with 30 community members after movement restrictions were eased across the country. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a two-stage deductive and inductive thematic analysis.

ResultsMost participants were aware that some people are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes but were unaware of the concept of shielding. Most participants found shielding acceptable and consistent with cultural inclinations to respect elders and protect the vulnerable. However, extra-household shielding arrangements were mostly seen as socially unacceptable. Participants reported feasibility concerns related to the social isolation of shielded persons and loss of income for shielding families. The acceptability and feasibility of shielding strategies were reduced after movement restrictions were eased, as participants reported lower perception of risk in their communities and increased pressure to comply with social commitments outside the house.

ConclusionShielding is generally acceptable in the study communities. Acceptability is influenced by feasibility, and by contextual changes in the epidemic and associated policy response. The promotion of shielding should capitalise on the cultural and moral sense of duty towards elders and vulnerable groups. Communities and households should be provided with practical guidance to implement feasible shielding options. Households must be socially, psychologically and financially supported to adopt and sustain shielding effectively.",Nada Abdelmagid; Salma A.E.

359,COVID-19 in persons affected by Hansen's disease in Brazil,"BackgroundHansens disease (HD) is endemic in Brazil, a country with the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest number of COVID-19 deaths. COVID-19 in persons affected by HD has not been described at population level in this country.

MethodsWe collated numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths among patients who were receiving routine treatment for HD at six centres across Brazil (Belem, Bauru, Brasilia, Vitoria, Petrolina, Palmas) between 1st March and 10th December 2020.

ResultsOf 1,333 HD patients receiving treatment, 70 (5.2%) reported having had COVID-19. Almost all patients (97% (1,296/1,333)) including all but one of the COVID-19 cases were receiving MDT comprising rifampicin (600mg once per month), dapsone (100mg daily), and clofazimine (50 mg daily plus 300 mg once per month). Four patients died, including a patient in their 30s on MDT who had a severe type 2 HD reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum) and who was taking clofazimine 100mg daily.

ConclusionsWe cannot determine from these preliminary data whether persons affected by Hansens disease have a higher or lower risk of COVID-19 and related mortality compared with the general population. We will continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19 in persons affected by and treated for HD and extend this to monitor SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness in this group of patients.",Patrícia Deps; Taynah Repsold; Claudio Salgado; Raquel de Carvalho Bouth; Selma Regina Penha Silva Cerqueira; Marisa Simon Brezinscki; Rebeca Ruppert Galarda Baptista Peixoto; Jaison Antonio Barreto; Andrea Fonseca; Marlene Peixoto; Seyna Ueno Mendes; Rafael Pereira Rabelo Mendes; Pedro Paulo dos Santos Oliveira; Ciro Martins Gomes,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247262,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247262,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
360,Mathematical assessment of the roles of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 dynamics: a multigroup modeling approach,"A novel coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 (COVID-19), causing a pandemic that continues to inflict unprecedented public health and economic burden in all nooks and corners of the world. Although the control of COVID-19 has largely focused on the use of basic public health measures (primarily based on using non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine, isolation, social-distancing, face mask usage and community lockdowns), a number of exceptionally-promising vaccines are about to be approved for use in humans by the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration. We present a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the candidate vaccines, particularly for the case where the vaccination program is complemented with a social-distancing control measure at a certain compliance level. The model stratifies the total population into two subgroups, based on whether or not they habitually wear face mask in public. The resulting multigroup model, which takes the form of a compartmental, deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parametrized using COVID-19 cumulative mortality data. Conditions for the asymptotic stability of the associated disease-free equilibrium, as well as expression for the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold, are derived. This study shows that the prospect of COVID-19 elimination using any of the three candidate vaccines is quite promising, and that such elimination is more feasible if the vaccination program is combined with social-distancing control measures (implemented at moderate to high level of compliance).",Abba B Gumel; Enahoro A Iboi; Calistus N Ngonghala; Gideon A Ngwa,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247916,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247916,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True

MethodsA spatio-temporal ecological framework was applied to determine census-tracts that had significantly higher rates of occupations likely to be deemed essential: food-service, business and finance, healthcare support, and maintenance. Real-time mobility data was used to determine the average daily percent of residents not leaving their place of residence. Spatial regression models were constructed for each occupation proportion among census-tracts within a large urban area.

ResultsAfter adjusting for demographics, results indicate census-tracts with higher proportion of food-service workers, healthcare support employees, and office administration staff are likely to have increased mobility.

ConclusionsIncreased mobility among communities is likely to exacerbate COVID-19 mitigation efforts. This increase in mobility was also found associated with specific demographics suggesting it may be occurring among underserved and vulnerable populations.

362,Screening for high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 identifies pre-symptomatic subjects among healthy healthcare workers,"BackgroundPre-symptomatic subjects are spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and strategies that could identify these subjects, particularly in hospital settings, are needed.

MethodsWe tested a cohort of 9449 employees at work at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies, linked the screening results to sick leave records and examined the association between screening results and past or future sick leave using multinomial logistic regression.

ResultsWe found that healthcare workers with high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus, as indicated by the Cycle threshold (Ct) value in the PCR, had the highest risk for sick leave in the two weeks after testing (OR 11{middle dot}97 (CI 95% 6{middle dot}29-22{middle dot}80)) whereas subjects with low amounts of virus had the highest risk for sick leave in the past three weeks before testing (OR 6{middle dot}31 (4{middle dot}38-9{middle dot}08)). Only 2{middle dot}5% of employees were SARS-CoV-2 positive while 10{middle dot}5% were positive by serology and 1{middle dot}2% were positive in both tests. Serology-positive subjects were not at excess risk for future sick leave (OR 1{middle dot}06 (95% CI, 0{middle dot}71-1{middle dot}57)), but virus-positive subjects had a 7{middle dot}23 fold (95% CI, 4{middle dot}52-11{middle dot}57)) increased risk for sick leave within two weeks post testing.

ConclusionsScreening of asymptomatic healthcare workers for high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus using Ct values will identify pre-symptomatic subjects who will develop disease in the next few weeks. Identification of potentially contagious, pre-symptomatic subjects is likely critical for protecting patients and healthcare workers.

363,Association of University Reopening Policies with New Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in the United States,"Reopening of universities in the U.S. has been controversial in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We leveraged several publicly available data sources to study the association of county-level new confirmed COVID-19 case rates since September 1st and the number of students returning to campus across 2,893 U.S. counties with and without universities. In 1,069 U.S. counties with universities, we also studied the association of different reopening policies (online, in-person, hybrid) on new confirmed COVID-19 cases. Multivariate regression models estimated both effects of university reopening and different reopening policies. Mean number of daily confirmed cases per 10,000 county population was 1.51 from August 1st to August 31st, and 1.98 from September 1st to October 22nd. Mean number of students returning to universities was 2.1% (95% CI, 1.8% to 2.3%) of the county population and the number of students returning to campus had a positive association ({beta} = 2.006, p-value < 0.001) with new confirmed COVID-19 cases within the local county region where the institution resided. For U.S. counties with universities, the mean proportion of online enrollment within each county was 40.1% (95% CI, 37.4% to 42.8%), with most students enrolling in-person or hybrid mode. In comparison to holding class in-person, reopening universities online ({beta} = -0.329, p-value < 0.001) or in a hybrid mode ({beta} = -0.272, p-value = 0.012) was negatively associated with new confirmed COVID-19 cases. These findings could help public health officials consider policies to mitigate additional waves of infection during the upcoming winter.

Significance StatementOur study finds that higher numbers of students returning to campus was associated with an increase in new confirmed COVID-19 cases; reopening online or partially online was associated with slower spread of the virus, in comparison to in-person reopening.

364,Unique predictors of intended uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine,"IntroductionAn effective vaccine for COVID-19 is only of value if the public has confidence in taking it. There is little data on COVID-19-specific vaccine confidence or its determinants in the United States. The objective of this study was to determine public confidence in a COVID-19 vaccine.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of Pennsylvanian adults, August-October, 2020, to identify their likelihood of taking an approved, no-cost coronavirus vaccine, general vaccine acceptance, and sociodemographic traits to identify predictors of vaccine acceptance.

ResultsOf the 950 respondents, 55% were ""very likely"", 20% ""somewhat likely"", 14% ""unsure"", 4% ""somewhat unlikely"", and 7% ""very unlikely"" to take a coronavirus vaccine, even though 70% had taken the flu vaccine since September 2019. The strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance were trust in the system evaluating vaccines and perceptions of local COVID-19 vaccination norms. The strongest predictors of negative vaccine intentions were worries about unknown side-effects and positive attitudes toward natural infection. Sociodemographic factors, political views, and religiosity did not predict vaccine intentions.

365,Assessing Durability of Vaccine Effect Following Blinded Crossover in COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trials,"BackgroundSeveral candidate vaccines to prevent COVID-19 disease have entered large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials and some have demonstrated substantial short-term efficacy. Efficacious vaccines should, at some point, be offered to placebo participants, which will occur before long-term efficacy and safety are known.

MethodsFollowing vaccination of the placebo group, we show that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be derived by assuming the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the placebo crossovers. This reconstruction allows estimation of both vaccine durability and potential vaccine-associated enhanced disease.

ResultsPost-crossover estimates of vaccine efficacy can provide insights about durability, identify waning efficacy, and identify late enhancement of disease, but are less reliable estimates than those obtained by a standard trial where the placebo cohort is maintained. As vaccine efficacy estimates for post-crossover periods depend on prior vaccine efficacy estimates, longer pre-crossover periods with higher case counts provide better estimates of late vaccine efficacy. Further, open-label crossover may lead to riskier behavior in the immediate crossover period for the unblinded vaccine arm, confounding vaccine efficacy estimates for all post-crossover periods.

ConclusionsWe advocate blinded crossover and continued follow-up of trial participants to best assess vaccine durability and potential delayed enhancement of disease. This approach allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain participants on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunological and clinical effectiveness over time.",Dean Follmann; Jonathan Fintzi; Michael P.

366,Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission may prevent or dampen a spring wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths in 2021,"Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials assess vaccine efficacy against disease (VEDIS), the ability of a vaccine to block symptomatic COVID-19. They will only partially discriminate whether VEDIS is mediated by preventing infection as defined by the detection of virus in the airways (vaccine efficacy against infection defined as VESUSC), or by preventing symptoms despite breakthrough infection (vaccine efficacy against symptoms or VESYMP). Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEINF), defined as the decrease in secondary transmissions from infected vaccine recipients versus from infected placebo recipients, is also not being measured. Using mathematical modeling of data from King County Washington, we demonstrate that if the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which have observed VEDIS>90%, mediate VEDIS predominately by complete protection against infection, then prevention of a fourth epidemic wave in the spring of 2021, and associated reduction of subsequent cases and deaths by 60%, is likely to occur assuming rapid enough vaccine roll out. If high VEDIS is explained primarily by reduction in symptoms, then VEINF>50% will be necessary to prevent or limit the extent of this fourth epidemic wave. The potential added benefits of high VEINF would be evident regardless of vaccine allocation strategy and would be enhanced if vaccine roll out rate is low or if available vaccines demonstrate waning immunity. Finally, we demonstrate that a 1.0 log vaccine-mediated reduction in average peak viral load might be sufficient to achieve VEINF=60% and that human challenge studies with 104 infected participants, or clinical trials in a university student population could estimate VESUSC, VESYMP and VEINF using viral load metrics.",David A Swan; Ashish Goyal; Chloe Bracis; Mia Moore; Elizabeth Krantz; Elizabeth R Brown; Fabian Cardozo-Ojeda; Daniel B Reeves; Fei Gao; Peter B Gilbert; Lawrence Corey; Myron S Cohen; Holly Janes; Dobromir Dimitrov; Joshua T Schiffer,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248120,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.20248120,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,True
367,Profiling of oral microbiota and cytokines in COVID-19 patients,"SARS-CoV-2 presence has been recently demonstrated in the sputum or saliva, suggesting how the shedding of viral RNA outlasts the end of symptoms. Recent data from transcriptome analysis show that oral cavity mucosa harbors high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, highlighting its role as a double-edged sword for SARS-CoV-2 body entrance or interpersonal transmission. In the present study, for the first time, we demonstrate the oral microbiota structure and inflammatory profile of COVID-19 patients. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients and matched healthy controls underwent naso/oral-pharyngeal and oral swabs. Microbiota structure was analyzed by 16S rRNA V2 automated targeted sequencing, while oral and sera concentrations of 27 cytokines were assessed using magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays. A significant diminution in species richness was observed in COVID-19 patients, along with a marked difference in beta-diversity. Species such as Prevotella salivae and Veillonella infantium were distinctive for COVID-19 patients, while Neisseria perflava and Granulicatella elegans were predominant in controls. Interestingly, these two groups of oral species oppositely clustered within the bacterial network, defining two distinct Species Interacting Group (SIGs). Pro-inflammatory cytokines were distinctive for COVID-19 in both oral and serum samples, and we found a specific bacterial consortium able to counteract them, following a novel index called C4 firstly proposed here.

368,Identification of bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors from a library of natural products in vitro,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public health issue. To screen for antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) pseudovirus system using an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector with a luciferase reporter gene to screen 188 small potential antiviral compounds. Using this system, we identified nine compounds, specifically, bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, that potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, with EC50 values of 0.1-10 M. Mechanistic studies showed that these compounds, reported as calcium channel blockers (CCBs), inhibited Ca2+-mediated membrane fusion and consequently suppressed coronavirus entry. These candidate drugs showed broad-spectrum efficacy against the entry of several coronavirus pseudotypes (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 [S-D614 and S-G614]) in different cell lines (293T, Calu-3, and A549). Antiviral tests using native SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells confirmed that four of the drugs (SC9/cepharanthine, SC161/hernandezine, SC171, and SC185/neferine) reduced cytopathic effect and supernatant viral RNA load. Among them, cepharanthine showed the strongest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.

369,Hepatitis C Virus Drugs Simeprevir and Grazoprevir Synergize with Remdesivir to Suppress SARS-CoV-2 Replication in Cell Culture,"Effective control of COVID-19 requires antivirals directed against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here we assess ten available HCV protease inhibitor drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. There is a striking structural similarity of the substrate binding clefts of SARS- CoV-2 Mpro and HCV NS3/4A proteases, and virtual docking experiments show that all ten HCV drugs can potentially bind into the Mpro binding cleft. Seven of these HCV drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease activity, while four dock well into the PLpro substrate binding cleft and inhibit PLpro protease activity. These same seven HCV drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in Vero and/or human cells, demonstrating that HCV drugs that inhibit Mpro, or both Mpro and PLpro, suppress virus replication. Two HCV drugs, simeprevir and grazoprevir synergize with the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir to inhibit virus replication, thereby increasing remdesivir inhibitory activity as much as 10-fold.

370,Computational Analysis of Dynamic Allostery and Control in the three SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the COVID-19 pandemic, has no vaccine or antiviral drugs available to the public, at the time of writing. The virus non-structural proteins are promising drug targets because of their vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which covalently and competitively bind the active site of the non-structural proteins, but little has been done to address regions other than the active site, i.e. for non-competitive inhibition. Here we extend previous work on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (nsp5) to three other SARS-CoV-2 proteins: host shutoff factor (nsp1), papain-like protease (nsp3, also known as PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (nsp12, also known as RdRp) in complex with nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors. Using open-source software (DDPT) to construct Elastic Network Models (ENM) of the chosen proteins we analyse their fluctuation dynamics and thermodynamics, as well as using this protein family to study convergence and robustness of the ENM. Exhaustive 2-point mutational scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies suggest several new candidate regions, distant from the active site, for control of the proteins function, which may assist the drug development based on the current small molecule binding screens. The results also provide new insights, including non-additive effects of double-mutation or inhibition, into the active biophysical research field of protein fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.",Igors Dubanevics; Charles Heaton; Carlos Riechmann; Tom C B McLeish,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.422477,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.422477,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
371,Neuroinvasion and encephalitis following intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause neurological disease in humans, but little is known about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system. Herein, using K18-hACE2 mice, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and encephalitis is associated with mortality in these mice. Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 105 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after infection. The highest virus titers in the lungs were observed at day 3 and declined at days 5 and 6 after infection. In contrast, very high levels of infectious virus were uniformly detected in the brains of all the animals at days 5 and 6. Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection. Our data indicate that direct infection of CNS cells together with the induced inflammatory response in the brain resulted in the severe disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice.",Pratima Kumari; Hussin A Rothan; Janhavi P Natekar; Shannon Stone; Heather Pathak; Philip G Strate; Komal Arora; Margo A Brinton; Mukesh Kumar,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422714,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422714,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
372,Surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 drive airway epithelial cells to induce interferon-dependent inflammation,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic, robustly activates the host immune system in critically ill patients. Understanding how the virus engages the immune system will facilitate the development of needed therapeutic strategies. Here we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that the SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins Spike (S) and Envelope (E) activate the key immune signaling interferon (IFN) pathway in both immune and epithelial cells independent of viral infection and replication. These proteins induce reactive oxidative species generation and increases in human and murine specific IFN-responsive cytokines and chemokines, similar to their upregulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Induction of IFN signaling is dependent on canonical but discrepant inflammatory signaling mediators as the activation induced by S is dependent on IRF3, TBK1, and MYD88 while that of E is largely MYD88 independent. Furthermore, these viral surface proteins, specifically E, induced peribronchial inflammation and pulmonary vasculitis in a mouse model. Finally we show that the organized inflammatory infiltrates are dependent on type I IFN signaling, specifically in lung epithelial cells. These findings underscore the role of SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins, particularly the understudied E protein, in driving cell specific inflammation and their potential for therapeutic intervention.

Author SummarySARS-CoV-2 robustly activates widespread inflammation, but we do not understand mechanistically how the virus engages the immune system. This knowledge will facilitate the development of critically needed therapeutic strategies to promote beneficial immune responses will dampening harmful inflammation. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins spike and envelope alone activated innate cell function and the interferon signaling pathway. This activation occurred in both immune and epithelial cells, and mechanistic studies demonstrated dependence on known key inflammatory signaling mediators, IRF3, TBK1, and MYD88. In animal studies, we showed that these viral surface proteins induce epithelial cell IFN-dependent lung pathology, reminiscent to acute COVID-19 pulmonary infection. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into the role of SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins, particularly the understudied E protein, in driving cell specific inflammation.",Gautam Anand; Alexandra M Perry; Celeste L Cummings; Emma St. Raymond; Regina A Clemens; Ashley L Steed,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422710,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422710,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
373,Targeting Scavenger Receptor Type B-1 (SR-B1) and Cholesterol Inhibits Entry of SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus in Cell Culture,"The novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has now caused a global pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is known as COVID-19. To date, few treatments for COVID-19 have proven effective, and the current standard of care is primarily supportive. As a result, novel therapeutic strategies are in high demand. Viral entry into target cells is frequently sensitive to cell membrane lipid composition and membrane organization. Evidence suggests that cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is most efficient when the target cell plasma membrane is replete with cholesterol; and recent data implicate cholesterol flux through the high-affinity receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoprotein (HDL), called scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1), as critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here, we demonstrate that a cholesterol-poor synthetic biologic high-density lipoprotein (HDL NP) targets SR-B1 and inhibits cell entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus. Human cells expressing SR-B1 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and viral entry can be inhibited by 50-80% using HDL NPs in an SR-B1-dependent manner. These results indicate that HDL NP targeting of SR-B1 is a powerful potential therapy to combat COVID-19 and other viral diseases.",Stephen E Henrich; Kaylin M McMahon; Nicole Palacio; Pankaj Bhalla; Pablo Penaloza-MacMaster; Colby Shad Thaxton,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.420133,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.420133,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
374,SARS-CoV-2 Requires Cholesterol for Viral Entry and Pathological Syncytia Formation,"Many enveloped viruses induce multinucleated cells (syncytia), reflective of membrane fusion events caused by the same machinery that underlies viral entry. These syncytia are thought to facilitate replication and evasion of the host immune response. Here, we report that co-culture of human cells expressing the receptor ACE2 with cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike, results in synapse-like intercellular contacts that initiate cell-cell fusion, producing syncytia resembling those we identify in lungs of COVID-19 patients. To assess the mechanism of spike/ACE2-driven membrane fusion, we developed a microscopy-based, cell-cell fusion assay to screen [~]6000 drugs and >30 spike variants. Together with cell biological and biophysical approaches, the screen reveals an essential role for membrane cholesterol in spike-mediated fusion, which extends to replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Our findings provide a molecular basis for positive outcomes reported in COVID-19 patients taking statins, and suggest new strategies for therapeutics targeting the membrane of SARS-CoV-2 and other fusogenic viruses.

375,Recurrent emergence and transmission of a SARS-CoV-2 Spike deletion ΔH69/V70,"SARS-CoV-2 Spike amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain (RBD) occur relatively frequently and some have a consequence for immune recognition. Here we report recurrent emergence and significant onward transmission of a six-nucleotide deletion in the S gene, which results in loss of two amino acids: H69 and V70. Of particular note this deletion, H69/V70, often co-occurs with the receptor binding motif amino acid replacements N501Y, N439K and Y453F. One of the delH69/V70+ N501Y lineages, B.1.1.7, is comprised of over 1400 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the UK and includes eight S gene mutations: RBD (N501Y and A570D), S1 (delH69/V70 and del144/145) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H). Some of these mutations have possibly arisen as a result of the virus evolving from immune selection pressure in infected individuals and possibly only one chronic infection in the case of lineage B.1.1.7. We find the delH69/V70 enhances viral infectivity, indicating its effect on virus fitness is independent to the N501Y RBM change. Enhanced surveillance for the delH69/V70 deletion with and without RBD mutations should be considered as a priority. Such mutations have the potential to enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to generate vaccine escape variants that would have otherwise significantly reduced viral fitness.",Steven Kemp; William Harvey; Rawlings Datir; Dami Collier; Isabella Ferreira; Alessandro Carabelii; David L Robertson; Ravindra K Gupta,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422555,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422555,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
376,Decomposing the sources of SARS-CoV-2 fitness variation in the United States,"The fitness of a pathogen is composite phenotype determined by many different factors influencing growth rates both within and between hosts. Determining what factors shape fitness at the host population-level is especially challenging because both intrinsic factors like pathogen genetics and extrinsic factors such as host behaviour influence between-host transmission potential. These challenges have been highlighted by controversy surrounding the population-level fitness effects of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their relative importance when compared against non-genetic factors shaping transmission dynamics. Building upon phylodynamic birth-death models, we develop a new framework to learn how hundreds of genetic and non-genetic factors have shaped the fitness of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate the fitness effects of all amino acid variants and several structural variants that have circulated in the United States between February and September 2020 from viral phylogenies. We also estimate how much fitness variation among pathogen lineages is attributable to genetic versus non-genetic factors such as spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates. Up to September 2020, most fitness variation between lineages can be explained by background spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates across geographic regions. Furthermore, no genetic variant including the Spike D614G mutation has had a significant effect on population-level fitness. Instead, the rapid increase in the frequency of the Spike D614G can be explained by the variant having a spatial transmission advantage due to first establishing in regions with higher transmission rates during the earliest stages of the pandemic.",Lenora Kepler; Marco Hamins-Puertolas; David A Rasmussen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422739,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.422739,2020-12-14,2020-12-14,,False
377,The Potential for SARS-CoV-2 to Evade Both Natural and Vaccine-induced Immunity,"SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the surface of susceptible cells through extensive interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) anchored in cell membranes. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the spike protein are able to prevent antibody binding, yet while maintaining the ability to bind ACE2 and viral infectivity, mutations in the spike protein identified in cases of human infection were mapped to the crystallographically-determined interfaces between the spike protein and ACE2 (PDB entry 6M0J), antibody CC12.1 (PDB entry 6XC2), and antibody P2B-2F6 (PDB entry 7BWJ).

Both antibody binding interfaces partially overlap with the ACE2 binding interface. Among 16 mutations that map to the RBD:CC12.1 interface, 11 are likely to disrupt CC12.1 binding but not ACE2 binding. Among 12 mutations that map to the RBD:P2B-2F6 interface, 8 are likely to disrupt P2B-2F6 binding but not ACE2 binding. As expected, none of the mutations observed to date appear likely to disrupt the RBD:ACE2 interface.

We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 with mutated forms of the spike protein may retain the ability to bind ACE2 while evading recognition by antibodies that arise in response to the original wild-type form of the spike protein. It seems likely that immune evasion will be possible regardless of whether the spike protein was encountered in the form of infectious virus, or as the immunogen in a vaccine. Therefore, it also seems likely that reinfection with a variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 may occur among people who recover from Covid-19, and that vaccines with the ability to generate antibodies against multiple variant forms of the spike protein will be necessary to protect against variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 that are already circulating in the human population.",Emily Shang; Paul Axelsen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.422567,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.13.422567,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,,False
378,Generation of a SARS-CoV-2 Replicon as a Model System to Dissect Virus Replication and Antiviral Inhibition,"SARS-CoV-2 research and antiviral discovery are hampered by the lack of a cell-based virus replication system that can be readily adopted without biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) restrictions. Here, the construction of a non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon and its application in deciphering viral replication mechanisms and evaluating SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors are presented. The replicon genome is replication competent but does not produce progeny virions. Its replication can be inhibited by RdRp mutations or by known SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds. Using this system, a high-throughput antiviral assay has also been developed. Significant differences in potencies of several SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in different cell lines were observed, which highlights the challenges of discovering antivirals capable of inhibiting viral replication in vivo and the importance of testing compounds in multiple cell culture models. The generation of a SARS-CoV-2 replicon provides a powerful platform to expand the global research effort to combat COVID-19.",Xi He; Shuo Quan; Min Xu; Silveria Rodriguez; Shih Lin Goh; Jiajie Wei; Arthur Fridman; Kenneth A Koeplinger; Steve S Carroll; Jay A Grobler; Amy S Espeseth; David B Olsen; Daria J Hazuda; Dai Wang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.422532,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.12.422532,2020-12-13,2020-12-13,,False
379,Evaluation of in vitro activity of copper gluconate against SARS-CoV-2 using confocal microscopy-based high content screening,"ContextSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged late in 2019 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). There is an urgent need to develop curative and preventive therapeutics to limit the current pandemic and to prevent the re-emergence of Covid-19. This study aimed to assess the in vitro activity of copper gluconate against SRAS-CoV-2.

MethodsVero E6 cells were treated with copper gluconate 18 hours before infection. Cells were infected with a recombinant GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2. Infected cells were maintained in fresh medium containing copper gluconate for an additional 48-hour period. The infection level was measured by the confocal microscopy-based high content screening method. The cell viability in presence of copper gluconate was assessed by XTT assay.

ResultsThe viability of Vero E6 cells treated with copper gluconate up to 200 M was found to be similar to that of untreated cells, but it dropped below 40% with 400 M of this agent. The infection rate was 23.8%, 18.9%, 20.6%, 6.9%, 5.3%,5.2% in cells treated with 0, 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 M of copper gluconate respectively. As compared to untreated cells, the number of infected cells was reduced by 71%, 77%, and 78% with 25, 50, and 100 M of copper gluconate respectively (p < 0.05).

ConclusionCopper gluconate was found to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Furthers studies are needed to determine whether copper homeostasis could play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

380,A novel cell culture system modeling the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the global pandemic of COVID-19, and no effective antiviral agents and vaccines are available. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a biosafety level-3 (BLS-3) agent, impeding the basic research into its biology and the development of effective antivirals. Here, we developed a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) cell culture system for production of transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP). This trVLP expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N), which is required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2-GFP/{Delta}N trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be achieved and exclusively confined in the cells ectopically expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, but not MERS-CoV N. Genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in the N-expressing cells. Moreover, intein-mediated protein trans-splicing approach was utilized to split the viral N gene into two independent vectors, and the ligated viral N protein could function in trans to recapitulate entire viral life cycle, further securing the biosafety of this cell culture model. Based on this BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 cell culture model, we developed a 96-well format high throughput screening for antivirals discovery. We identified salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium, lycorine chloride and nigericin sodium as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, we developed a convenient and efficient SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics tool to dissect the virus life cycle under a BSL-2 condition.

381,SARS-CoV-2 RNA reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome,"Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding and recurrence of PCR-positive tests have been widely reported in patients after recovery, yet these patients most commonly are non-infectious1-14. Here we investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for PCR-positive tests. In support of this hypothesis, we found chimeric transcripts consisting of viral fused to cellular sequences in published data sets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultured cells and primary cells of patients, consistent with the transcription of viral sequences integrated into the genome. To experimentally corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT, and that these DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed. Human endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells, suggesting a molecular mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in patients. This novel feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain why patients can continue to produce viral RNA after recovery and suggests a new aspect of RNA virus replication.",Liguo Zhang; Alexsia Richards; Andrew Khalil; Emile Wogram; Haiting Ma; Richard A.

Here, we present the most comprehensive S-protein-based linear B-cell epitope candidate list by combining epitopes predicted by eight widely-used immune-informatics methods with the epitopes curated from literature published between Feb 6, 2020 and July 10, 2020. We find four top prioritized linear B-cell epitopes in the hotspot regions of S protein can specifically bind with serum antibodies from horse, mouse, and monkey inoculated with different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates or a patient recovering from COVID-19.

Here, we show that 2-8% of people in Eurasia carry a variant promoter region of the DPP4 gene inherited from Neandertals.

385,Millisecond-scale molecular dynamics simulation of spike RBD structure reveals evolutionary adaption of SARS-CoV-2 to stably bind ACE2,"The Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike (S) protein interacts with host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry to host cells and initiate infection1-3. Detailed, accurate understanding of key interactions between S RBD and ACE2 provides critical information that may be leveraged in the development of strategies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Utilizing the published sequences and cryo-EM structures of both the viral S RBD and ACE24,5, we performed in silico molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of free S RBD and of its interaction with ACE2 over the exceptionally long durations of 2.9 and 2 milliseconds, respectively, to elucidate the nature and relative affinity of S RBD surface residues for the ACE2 binding region. Our findings reveal that free S RBD has assumed an optimized ACE2 binding-ready conformation, incurring little entropic penalty for binding, an evolutionary adaptation that contributes to its high affinity for the receptor6. We further identified high probability molecular binding interactions that inform both vaccine design and therapeutic development, which may include recombinant ACE2-based spike decoys7 and/or allosteric S RBD-ACE2 binding inhibitors8,9 to prevent or arrest infection and thus disease.",Gard Nelson; Oleksandr Buzko; Aaron Bassett; Patricia R Spilman; Kayvan Niazi; Shahrooz Rabizadeh; Patrick Soon-Shiong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.422055,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.422055,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,,False
386,"Social and racial inequalities in COVID-19 risk of hospitalisation and death across Sao Paulo state, Brazil","BackgroundLittle evidence exists on the differential health effects of COVID-19 on disadvantaged population groups. Here we characterise the differential risk of hospitalisation and death in Sao Paulo state, Brazil and show how vulnerability to COVID-19 is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study using hospitalised severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) notified from March to August 2020, in the Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente de Sao Paulo (SIMI-SP) database. We examined the risk of hospitalisation and death by race and socioeconomic status using multiple datasets for individual-level and spatio-temporal analyses. We explained these inequalities according to differences in daily mobility from mobile phone data, teleworking behaviour, and comorbidities.

FindingsThroughout the study period, patients living in the 40% poorest areas were more likely to die when compared to patients living in the 5% wealthiest areas (OR: 1{middle dot}60, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}48 - 1{middle dot}74) and were more likely to be hospitalised between April and July, 2020 (OR: 1{middle dot}08, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}04 - 1{middle dot}12). Black and Pardo individuals were more likely to be hospitalised when compared to White individuals (OR: 1{middle dot}37, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}32 - 1{middle dot}41; OR: 1{middle dot}23, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}21 - 1{middle dot}25, respectively), and were more likely to die (OR: 1{middle dot}14, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}07 - 1{middle dot}21; 1{middle dot}09, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}05 - 1{middle dot}13, respectively).

InterpretationLow-income and Black and Pardo communities are more likely to die with COVID-19. This is associated with differential access to healthcare, adherence to social distancing, and the higher prevalence of comorbidities.

387,Intention of health care workers to accept COVID-19 vaccination and related factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundConsidering medical and economic burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a high COVID-19 vaccination coverage among health care workers (HCWs) is an urgent need.

ObjectiveTo estimate the intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19 vaccination and to find out related factors.

DesignWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this study.

Data sourcesWe searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, CINAHL and medRxiv from January 1, 2020 to December 02, 2020.

MethodsThe heterogeneity between results was very high and thus we applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects. We performed subgroup and meta-regression analysis to identify possible resources of heterogeneity.

ResultsEleven studies, including 8847 HCWs met the inclusion criteria. The overall proportion of HCWs that intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination was 55.9% (95% CI: 43.6-67.9%) with a wide range among studies from 27.7% to 81.5%. Intention of HCWs to accept COVID-19 vaccination was higher in studies with moderate quality and in studies that were conducted in Europe. The following factors were associated with increased HCWs willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19: male gender, older age, physician profession, fewer work experience, comorbidity among HCWs, seasonal influenza vaccination, stronger vaccine confidence, positive attitude towards a COVID-19 vaccine, fear about COVID-19, individual perceived risk about COVID-19, and contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

ConclusionsHCWs represent a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reluctance or refusal of HCWs to vaccinate against COVID-19 could diminish the trust of individuals and trigger a ripple effect in the general public. Since vaccination is a complex behavior, understanding the way that HCWs take the decision to accept or not COVID-19 vaccination will give us the opportunity to develop the appropriate interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Knowledge of the factors that affect intention of HWCs to accept COVID-19 vaccination is limited and there is an urgent need for further and more valid studies.",Petros A Galanis; Irene Vraka; Despoina Fragkou; Angeliki Bilali; Daphne Kaitelidou,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246041,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246041,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
388,Effects of photobiomodulation therapy combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring intubation: a pragmatic randomized placebo-controlled trial,"BackgroundPhotobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) when used isolated or combined with static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF) has been proven benefits on skeletal muscle increasing performance and reducing fatigue, increasing oxygen saturation, and modulating inflammatory process. However, it is unknown whether the effects observed with this therapy on respiratory muscles will be similar to the effects previously observed on skeletal muscles.

ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate whether PBMT-sMF is able to decrease the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to reduce the mortality rate of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, increasing the respiratory function and modulating the inflammatory process.

MethodsWe conducted a prospectively registered, pragmatic, triple-blinded (patients, therapists and outcome assessors), randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PBMT-sMF in patients with severe COVID-19, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, admitted to the ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PBMT-sMF (6 sites at the lower thorax - 189 J total, and 2 sites at the neck area - 63 J total) or placebo PBMT-sMF daily during all the ICU stay. The primary outcome was length of stay in the ICU defined by either discharge or death. The secondary outcomes were survival rate, muscle function of diaphragm, change in blood tests, change in mechanical ventilation parameters and change in arterial blood gas analysis.

ResultsA total of 30 patients underwent randomization (with 15 assigned to PBMT-sMF and 15 to placebo) and were analyzed. The length of stay in the ICU for the placebo group was 23.06 days while for the PBMT-sMF group was 16.26. However, there was no statistically difference between groups for the length of stay in the ICU (mean difference - MD = -6.80; 95% CI = -18.71 to 5.11). Regarding the secondary outcomes were observed statistically differences in favor of PBMT-sMF for diaphragm thickness, fraction of inspired oxygen, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, C-reactive protein, lymphocytes count, and hemoglobin (p<0.05).

ConclusionAmong patients with severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, PBMT-sMF was not superior to placebo in decrease the length of stay in the ICU. In contrast, PBMT-sMF increased muscle function of diaphragm, improved ventilatory parameters, decreased C-reactive protein levels and hemoglobin count, and increased lymphocytes count.",Thiago De Marchi; Fabiano Francio; Joao Vitor Ferlito; Renata Monteiro Weigert; Cristiane Aparecida de Oliveira; Ana Paula Merlo; Delcio Luis Pandini; Bolivar Antonio Pasqual Junior; Daniela Frare Giovanella; Shaiane Silva Tomazoni; Ernesto Cesar Pinto Leal-Junior,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.02.20237974,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.02.20237974,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
389,Neurological Disorders associated with COVID-19 Hospital Admissions : Experience of a Single Tertiary Healthcare Centre,"BackgroundEarly reports have detailed a range of neurological symptoms in patients with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is a lack of detailed description and incidence of the neurological disorders amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We describe a range of neurological disorders (other than non-specific neurological symptoms), including their clinical, radiological and laboratory findings, encountered in our cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to a large tertiary institution.

MethodsWe reviewed our prospectively collated database of all adult Neurology referrals, Neurology and Stroke admissions and Neurological multi-disciplinary team meetings for all hospitalized patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 from 17 March 2020 to 31 August 2020.

ResultsTwenty-nine of 1243 COVID-19 inpatients (2.3%) presented with COVID-19-related neurological disorders. The mean age was 68.9 +/- 13.5(SD) years, age range of 34-97 years, and there were 16 males. 22 patients had confirmed, 5 were probable and 2 had suspected COVID-19 infection according to the WHO case classification. Eight patients (27%) required critical care admission. Neurological symptoms at presentation included acute confusion and delirium, seizures, and new focal neurological deficits. Based on the pre-defined neurological phenotype, COVID-19 patients were grouped into four main categories. 16 patients had cerebrovascular events (13 with acute ischaemic stroke and 3 had haemorrhagic features), 7 patients were found to have inflammatory, non-inflammatory and autoimmune encephalopathy (including 2 with known Multiple Sclerosis), whilst disorders of movement and peripheral nervous system were diagnosed in 3 patients each.

ConclusionAlthough the exact prevalence and aetiology remain unclear, new onset of neurological disorders, in addition to anosmia, is non-sporadic during the acute COVID-19-infection.

Furthermore, we study a usage stop effect induced by a false positive quarantine. Our results reveal that policy makers should adjust digital contact tracing apps to the behavioral characteristics of a society.

391,Routine asymptomatic testing strategies for airline travel during the COVID-19 pandemic: a simulation analysis,"BackgroundAirline travel has been significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concern for individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission risk from importation. Routine viral testing strategies for COVID-19 may facilitate safe airline travel through reduction of individual and/or population-level risk, although the effectiveness and optimal design of these ""test-and-travel"" strategies remain unclear.

MethodsWe developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of airline travelers to evaluate the effectiveness of various testing strategies to reduce individual risk of infection and population-level risk of transmission. We evaluated five testing strategies in asymptomatic passengers: i) anterior nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) within 3 days of departure; ii) PCR within 3 days of departure and PCR 5 days after arrival; iii) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection); iv) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR 5 days after arrival; and v) PCR within 3 days of arrival alone. The travel period was defined as three days prior to the day of travel and two weeks following the day of travel, and we assumed passengers followed guidance on mask wearing during this period. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period (population-level transmission risk); the secondary outcome was the proportion of infectious persons detected on the day of travel (individual-level risk of infection). Sensitivity analyses were conducted.

FindingsAssuming a community SARS-CoV-2 incidence of 50 daily infections, we estimated that in a cohort of 100,000 airline travelers followed over the travel period, there would be a total of 2,796 (95% UI: 2,031, 4,336) infectious days with 229 (95% UI: 170, 336) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test (within 3 days prior to departure) reduced the number of infectious days by 35% (95% UI: 27, 42) and identified 88% (95% UI: 76, 94) of the actively infectious travelers on the day of flight; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 79% (95% UI: 71, 84). The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days by 32% (95% UI: 25, 39) and identified 87% (95% UI: 81, 92) of the actively infectious travelers; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 70% (95% UI: 65, 75). The post-travel PCR test alone (within 3 days of landing) reduced the number of infectious days by 42% (95% UI: 31, 51). The ratio of true positives to false positives varied with the incidence of infection. The overall study conclusions were robust in sensitivity analysis.

InterpretationRoutine asymptomatic testing for COVID-19 prior to travel can be an effective strategy to reduce individual risk of COVID-19 infection during travel, although post-travel testing with abbreviated quarantine is likely needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when traveling from a high to low incidence setting.",Mathew V Kiang; Elizabeth T Chin; Benjamin Q Huynh; Lloyd A C Chapman; Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer; Bryan Greenhouse; George W Rutherford; Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo; Diane Havlir; Sanjay Basu; Nathan C Lo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246132,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246132,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True

MethodsThis study is a retrospective case-series of symptomatic patients presenting to a single ED with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 12-August 9, 2020. We collected patient-level information regarding demographics, public insurance status (Medicare or Medicaid), comorbidities, level of care, and mortality using a structured chart review. We compared demographics and comorbidities of patients who were (1) able to convalesce at home, (2) required admission to general medical service, (3) required admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or (4) died within 30 days of the index visit. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to report adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) with hospital admission versus ED discharge home.

ResultsIn total, 993 patients who presented to the ED with symptoms were included in the analysis with 370 (37.3%) patients requiring hospital admission and 70 (7.1%) patients requiring ICU care. Patients requiring admission were more likely to be Black or African American, to be Hispanic or Latino, or to have public insurance (either Medicaid or Medicare.) On multivariable logistic regression analysis comparing which patients required hospital admission, African-American race (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.8) and Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5-2.0) were not associated with need for admission but, public insurance (Medicaid: aOR 3.4, 95% CI 2.2-5.4; Medicare: aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.3; Medicaid and Medicare: aOR 3.6 95% CI 2.1-6.2) and the presence of hypertension (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7), diabetes (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), obesity (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), heart failure (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-11.2), and hyperlipidemia (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) were identified as independent predictors of hospital admission.

ConclusionComorbidities and public insurance are predictors of more severe illness for patients with SARS-CoV-2. This study suggests that the disparities in severity seen in COVID-19 among African Americans and Hispanics are likely to be closely related to low socioeconomic status and chronic health conditions and do not reflect an independent predisposition to disease severity.",Sophia Newton; Benjamin Zollinger; Jincong Freeman; Seamus Moran; Alexandra Helfand; Kayla Authelet; Matthew McHarg; Nataly Montano Vargas; Robert Shesser; Joanna Cohen; Derek A.T.

However, it is unknown whether lipid levels have improved in recovered patients. In this study, a 3-6 month follow-up study was performed to examine serum levels of laboratory values in 107 discharged COVID-19 patients (mild = 59; severe/critical = 48; diagnoses on admission). 61 patients had a revisit chest CT scan. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze changes in laboratory values. LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). LDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in mild cases (p < 0.05). With adjustment of the factor of traditional Chinese medicine, LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly improved at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). Increases in HDL-c significantly correlated with increases in numbers of white blood cells (p<0.001) and decreases in levels of C-reactive protein (p < 0.05) during patients recovery. Residue lesions were observed in CT images in 69% (42 of 61) of follow-up patients.

396,Neutralising antibodies drive Spike mediated SARS-CoV-2 evasion,"SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is critical for virus infection via engagement of ACE2, and amino acid variation in Spike is increasingly appreciated. Given both vaccines and therapeutics are designed around Wuhan-1 Spike, this raises the theoretical possibility of virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs. Here we report fatal SARS-CoV-2 escape from neutralising antibodies in an immune suppressed individual treated with convalescent plasma, generating whole genome ultradeep sequences by both short and long read technologies over 23 time points spanning 101 days. Little evolutionary change was observed in the viral population over the first 65 days despite two courses of remdesivir. However, following convalescent plasma we observed dynamic virus population shifts, with the emergence of a dominant viral strain bearing D796H in S2 and{Delta} H69/{Delta}V70 in the S1 NTD of the Spike protein. As serum neutralisation waned, viruses with the escape genotype diminished in frequency, before returning during a final, unsuccessful course of convalescent plasma. In vitro, the Spike escape variant conferred decreased sensitivity to multiple units of convalescent plasma/sera from different recovered patients, whilst maintaining infectivity similar to wild type. These data reveal strong positive selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy and identify the combination of Spike mutations D796H and{Delta} H69/{Delta}V70 as a broad antibody resistance mechanism against commonly occurring antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.",Steven A Kemp; Dami A Collier; Rawlings Datir; Salma Gayed; Aminu Jahun; Myra Hosmillo; Isabella ATM Ferreira; Chloe Rees-Spear; Petra Mlcochova; Ines Ushiro Lumb; David Roberts; Anita Chandra; Nigel Temperton; Katherine Sharrocks; Elizabeth Blane; John A Briggs; - The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium; - The CITIID-NIHR BioResource COVID-19 Collaboration; Ken G Smith; John R Bradley; Chris Smith; Richard Goldstein; Ian G Goodfellow; Anna Smielewska; Jordan P Skittrall; Theo Gouliouris; Effrossyni Gkrania-Klotsas; Chris JR Illingworth; Laura E McCoy; Ravindra K Gupta,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.20241927,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.20241927,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True

ObjectiveTo study the effect of AYUSH formulation (Kabasura Kudineer tablets, Shakti drops and Turmeric plus) as an add-on treatment in patients with mild COVID - 19

MethodologySingle centre, two arms, open labelled randomized controlled trial with a total of 30 patients (15 in the intervention arm and 15 in the standard care arm). Intervention arm received a combination of 3 AYUSH formulation along with the standard of care treatment for 21 days. All patients were followed for 28 days. Symptom severity (using Modified Jackson scale), negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (using RTPCR) and quality of life (WHOWOL BREF questionnaire) was assessed.

ResultsFifteen patients (93.8%) in the intervention group and twelve patients (92.3%) in the standard care arm had complete resolution of symptoms (P value= 0.36). Negative conversion for SARS-CoV-2 was seen in thirteen patients (92.9%) in intervention arm and eleven patients (100%) in standard care arm at day 28 (P value = 0.56). There was no difference in the quality of life scores between the 2 groups.

398,"The burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population: Results from a statewide survey in Karnataka, India","BackgroundGlobally, the routinely used case-based reporting and IgG serosurveys underestimate the actual prevalence of COVID-19. Simultaneous estimation of IgG antibodies and active SARS-CoV-2 markers can provide a more accurate estimation.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 16416 people covering all risk groups was done between 3-16 September 2020 using the state of Karnatakas infrastructure of 290 hospitals across all 30 districts. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active, and total prevalence, while multinomial regression identified predictors.

FindingsThe overall adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27 {middle dot}3% (95% CI: 25 {middle dot}7-28 {middle dot}9), including IgG 16 {middle dot}4% (95% CI: 15 {middle dot}1 - 17 {middle dot}7) and active infection 12 {middle dot}7% (95% CI: 11 {middle dot}5-13 {middle dot}9). The case-to-infection ratio was 1:40, and the infection fatality rate was 0 {middle dot}05%. Influenza-like symptoms or contact with a COVID-19 positive patient are good predictors of active infection. The RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatic participants compared to 47% in asymptomatic.

InterpretationThis is the first comprehensive survey providing accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden anywhere in the world. Further, our findings provide a reasonable approximation of population immunity threshold levels. Using the RAT kits and following the syndromic approach can be useful in screening and monitoring COVID-19. Leveraging existing surveillance platforms, coupled with appropriate methods and sampling framework, renders our model replicable in other settings.",Giridhara R Babu; Rajesh Sundaresan; Siva Athreya; Jawaid Akhtar; Pankaj Kumar Pandey; Parimala S Maroor; Padma MR; Lalitha R; Mohammed Shariff; Lalitha Krishnappa; CN Manjunath; MK Sudarshan; Gururaj G; Ranganath TS; Vasanth Kumar DE; Pradeep Banandur; Deepa R; Shilpa Shiju; Eunice Lobo; Asish Satapathy; Lokesh Alahari; Prameela; Vinitha T; Anita Desai; V Ravi,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.20243949,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.20243949,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
399,Antibody landscape against SARS-CoV-2 proteome revealed significant differences between non-structural/ accessory proteins and structural proteins,"The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 proteome is largely unknown, especially for non-structural proteins and accessory proteins. Here we collected 2,360 COVID-19 sera and 601 control sera. We analyzed these sera on a protein microarray with 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, built an antibody response landscape for IgG and IgM. We found that non-structural proteins and accessory proteins NSP1, NSP7, NSP8, RdRp, ORF3b and ORF9b elicit prevalent IgG responses. The IgG patterns and dynamic of non-structural/ accessory proteins are different from that of S and N protein. The IgG responses against these 6 proteins are associated with disease severity and clinical outcome and declined sharply about 20 days after symptom onset. In non-survivors, sharp decrease of IgG antibodies against S1 and N protein before death was observed. The global antibody responses to non-structural/ accessory proteins revealed here may facilitate deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunology.

HighlightsO_LIAn antibody response landscape against SARS-CoV-2 proteome was constructed

Previous methods for adjusting reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which usually have lots of missing values that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. We show this Bayesian approach lead to accurate estimates of the epidemic curve and time-varying reproductive numbers and is robust to deviations from model assumptions. We apply the Bayesian approach to a COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproductive number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the ones based on the reported curve.",Tenglong Li; Laura F.

Public universities in urban centers represent a substantial proportion of college students in the United States. We implemented a cross-sectional population-based online survey of 2,282 students in a large, public university in New York City in April 2020. We created weights to account for non-response and used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with mental health outcomes. Students experienced high rates of anxiety/depression and financial instability due to the pandemic. Half of the students reported anxiety/depression (54.5%) and an increased need for mental health services (49.0%) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority (81.1%) reported loss of household income, and half (49.8%) reported worries about losing housing. High levels of food (aPR=1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.6) and housing (aPR=1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.4) insecurity were the strongest predictors of anxiety/depression. Household and personal experiences with possible COVID-19 symptoms were also associated with anxiety/depression or the need for increased mental health services.

404,Impact of Convalescent Plasma Transfusion (CCP) In Patients With Previous Circulating Neutralizing Antibodies (nAb) to COVID-19,"INTRODUCTIONCOVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) transfusion has emerged in the past months as an alternative approach to treat pneumonia cases of SARS-CoV-2. Current evidence regarding characteristics of the plasma product, the titer of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in the transfused units, time to onset of intervention, and impact of nAbs produced by the patient are limited and heterogeneous.

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe describe the preliminary results of 104 patients with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 transfused with CCP at three medical centers in Brazil. All enrolled patients were transfused with doses between 200 mL through 600mL of ABO compatible CCP on days 0-2 after enrolment. Clinical parameters were monitored and nAbs titration was performed using the cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test with SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank MT126808.1).

RESULTSForty-one patients achieved clinical improvement on day 14, and multivariable logistic regression showed that nAbs T (from CCP units transfused) (p= 0.001), nAbs P0 (on day of enrolment) (p=0.009) and use of other supportive therapies (p<0.001) were associated with higher odds for this clinical improvement. Considering ICU length of stay (LOS) and length of mechanical ventilation, in our analysis, nAbs P0 were associated with a significant reduction in ICU LOS (p=0.018) and duration of mechanical ventilation (p<0.001). Administration of CCP after 10 days of symptom onset was associated with increases in ICU length of stay (p<0.001).

DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONDespite the study limitations, our data have shown an association between patients previously acquired nAbs and clinical outcomes. The potential value of timely administration of CCP transfusion before day 10 of disease onset was demonstrated and nAbsP0, but not nAbsT, were associated with ICU LOS, and duration of mechanical ventilation on the improvement of clinical outcomes was also demonstrated. In conclusion, we consider these data are useful parameters to guide future CPP transfusion strategies to COVID-19.",Ana Paula Hitomi Yokoyama; Silvano Wendel; Carolina Bonet-Bub; Roberta M Fachini; Ana Paula F Dametto; Fernando Blumm; Valeria F Dutra; Gabriela Candelaria; Araci M Sakashita; Rafael Rahal Guaragna Machado; Rita Fontao-Wendel; Nelson Hamerschlak; Ruth Achkar; Murillo Assuncao; Patricia Scuracchio; Victor Nudelman; Laerte Pastore; Joao Renato R Pinho; Mirian Dal Ben; Roberto Kalil Filho; Alexandre R Marra; Mariane T Amano; Esper Kallas; Alfredo Salim Helito; Carlos Roberto R Carvalho; Danielle Bastos Araujo; Edison Luiz Durigon; Anamaria A Camargo; Luiz V Rizzo; Luiz Fernando L Reis; Jose Mauro Kutner,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246173,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246173,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True

Recently, we reported preliminary BNT162b2 safety and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2 vaccine trial1. We present here antibody and T cell responses from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 19-55 years of age, after BNT162b2 prime/boost vaccination at 1 to 30 {micro}g dose levels. BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses, with S-binding IgG concentrations above those in a COVID-19 human convalescent sample (HCS) panel. Day 29 (7 days post-boost) SARS-CoV-2 serum 50% neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.3-fold (1 {micro}g) to 3.3-fold (30 {micro}g) those of the HCS panel. The BNT162b2-elicited sera neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 S variants. Concurrently, in most participants, S-specific CD8+ and T helper type 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cells had expanded, with a high fraction producing interferon-{gamma} (IFN{gamma}). Using peptide MHC multimers, the epitopes recognised by several BNT162b2-induced CD8+ T cells when presented on frequent MHC alleles were identified. CD8+ T cells were shown to be of the early-differentiated effector-memory phenotype, with single specificities reaching 0.01-3% of circulating CD8+ T cells. In summary, vaccination with BNT162b2 at well tolerated doses elicits a combined adaptive humoral and cellular immune response, which together may contribute to protection against COVID-19.",Ugur Sahin; Alexander Muik; Isabel Vogler; Evelyna Derhovanessian; Lena M Kranz; Mathias Vormehr; Jasmin Quandt; Nicole Bidmon; Alexander Ulges; Alina Baum; Kristen Pascal; Daniel Maurus; Sebastian Brachtendorf; Verena L Loerks; Julian Sikorski; Peter Koch; Rolf Hilker; Dirk Becker; Ann-Kathrin Eller; Jan Gruetzner; Manuel Tonigold; Carsten Boesler; Corinna Rosenbaum; Ludwig Heesen; Marie-Cristine Kuehnle; Asaf Poran; Jesse Z Dong; Ulrich Luxemburger; Alexandra Kemmer-Brueck; David Langer; Martin Bexon; Stefanie Bolte; Tania Palanche; Armin Schultz; Sybille Baumann; Azita J Mahiny; Gabor Boros; Jonas Reinholz; Gabor T Szabo; Katalin Kariko; Pei-Yong Shi; Camila Fontes-Garfias; John L Perez; Mark Cutler; David Cooper; Christos A Kyratsous; Philip R Dormitzer; Kathrin U Jansen; Oezlem Tuereci,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20245175,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20245175,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
406,Effect of clustering and correlation of belief systems on infectious disease outbreaks,"Contact between people with similar opinions and characteristics occurs at a higher rate than among other people, a phenomenon known as homophily. The presence of clusters of unvaccinated people has been associated with increased incidence of infectious disease outbreaks despite high vaccination coverage. The epidemiological consequences of homophily regarding other beliefs and correlations among belief systems are however poorly understood. Here, we use a simple compartmental disease model as well as a more complex COVID-19 model to study how homophily and correlation of belief systems in a social interaction network affect the probability of disease outbreak and COVID-19-related mortality. We find that the current social context, characterized by the presence of homophily and correlations between who vaccinates, who engages in risk reduction, and individual risk status, corresponds to a situation with substantially worse disease burden than in the absence of heterogeneities. In the presence of an effective vaccine, relative effects of homophily and correlation of belief systems become stronger. Further, the optimal vaccination strategy depends on the degree of homophily regarding vaccination status as well as the relative level of risk mitigation high- and low-risk individuals practice.

408,Characterizing superspreading of SARS-CoV-2: from mechanism to measurement,"Superspreading is a ubiquitous feature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, with a few primary infectors leading to a large proportion of secondary infections. Despite the superspreading events observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks, the mechanisms behind the phenomenon are still poorly understood. Here, we show that superspreading is largely driven by heterogeneity in contact behavior rather than heterogeneity in susceptibility or infectivity caused by biological factors. We find that highly heterogeneous contact behavior is required to produce the extreme superspreading estimated from recent COVID-19 outbreaks. However, we show that superspreading estimates are noisy and subject to biases in data collection and public health capacity, potentially leading to an overestimation of superspreading. These results suggest that superspreading for COVID-19 is substantial, but less than previously estimated.

It is important to investigate the transmission dynamic of COVID-19 to help understand the impact of the disease on public health and economy. While a number of epidemic models have been available to study infectious diseases, they are in-adequate to describe the dynamic of COVID-19. In this paper, we develop a new epidemic model which utilizes a set of ordinary differential equations with unknown parameters to delineate the transmission process of COVID-19. Different from the traditional epidemic models, this model accounts for asymptomatic infections as well the lag between symptoms onset and the confirmation date of infection. We describe an estimation procedure for the unknown parameters in the proposed model by adapting the iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) algorithm to the reported number of confirmed cases. To assess the performance of our proposed model, we examine COVID-19 data in Quebec for the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020 and carry out sensitivity studies under a variety of assumptions. To reflect the transmission potential of an infected case, we derive the basic reproduction number from the proposed model.

We developed and applied an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based approach to analyse social-media public sentiment in the UK and the US towards COVID-19 vaccinations, to understand public attitude and identify topics of concern.

MethodsOver 300,000 social-media posts related to COVID-19 vaccinations were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook-posts from the UK and 144,864 from the US, along with 40,268 tweets from the UK and 98,385 from the US respectively, from 1st March - 22nd November 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends and topics of discussion. These were analysed longitudinally and geo-spatially, and a manual reading of randomly selected posts around points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis.

ResultsWe found overall averaged positive, negative and neutral sentiment in the UK to be 58%, 22% and 17%, compared to 56%, 24% and 18% in the US, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness and trials as well as concerns over safety, economic viability and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to national surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly.

ConclusionsAI-enabled social-media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments, alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude.

413,Through The Back Door: Expiratory Accumulation of SARS-Cov-2 in the Olfactory Mucosa as Mechanism for CNS Penetration,"IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus supposed to enter the organism through aerosol or fomite transmission to the nose, eyes and oropharynx. It is responsible for various clinical symptoms, including hyposmia and other neurological ones. Current literature suggests the olfactory mucosa as a port of entry to the CNS, but how the virus reaches the olfactory groove is still unknown. Because the first neurological symptoms of invasion (hyposmia) do not correspond to first signs of infection, the hypothesis of direct contact through airborne droplets during primary infection and therefore during inspiration is not plausible. The aim of this study is to evaluate if a secondary spread to the olfactory groove in a retrograde manner during expiration could be more probable.

MethodsFour three-dimensional virtual models were obtained from real CT scans and used to simulate expiratory droplets. The volume mesh consists of 25 million of cells, the simulated condition is a steady expiration, driving a flow rate of 270 ml/s, for a duration of 0.6 seconds. Droplet diameter is of 5 m.

ResultsThe analysis of the simulations shows the virus to have a high probability to be deployed in the rhinopharynx, on the tail of medium and upper turbinates. The possibility for droplets to access the olfactory mucosa during the expiratory phase is lower than other nasal areas, but consistent.

DiscussionThe data obtained from these simulations demonstrates that virus can be deployed in the olfactory groove during expiration.

414,"Into the SARS-CoV-2 playgrounds: investigating the origins of the Belgian second wave, from an Antwerp perspective","BackgroundBelgium has been struggling with a second pandemic wave caused by SARS-CoV-2.

AimThe goal of this study was to estimate rates of carriership and viral loads in the general population in order to evaluate the dynamics leading to the second wave.

MethodsSince the major Antwerp hospitals implemented extensive (pre-)admission SARS-CoV-2 screening of patients (eg. prior to elective surgery), they have gathered valuable information regarding the viral prevalence, incidence, and viral loads in the general population throughout the pandemic period. Prevalences and incidences were calculated and compared with available governmental data (numbers of positively tested and contacted cases). Major government coronavirus responses were taken into account.

ResultsThe overall positivity rate of (pre)admission screenings was 1.3% (35.4% of positive cases carrying high viral loads). The highest prevalence of carriership was found in the elderly (2.6% for +80 y). 0-18 year-olds tested positive in 0.9% of cases. We estimated that, by extrapolation of cohort data, 20.3 % of the Antwerp population contracted the virus, whereas only 3.0 % was tested positive. In September, restriction measures were eased at a time when increased incidences were being observed.

ConclusionThe estimation that only a small proportion of the positive cases (including cases with high viral loads) was detected and traced, in combination with a country-wide easing of restriction measures within a period of increasing incidences (and within an overall high base-line prevalence of the virus), were, in our opinion, the major drivers in the origin of the second pandemic wave.",Reinout Naesens; Laura Heireman; Sarah Vandamme; Philippe Willems; Bruno Van Herendael; Walter Verstrepen; Pieter De Schouwer; Peggy Bruynseels,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246462,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246462,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
415,SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in renal transplant and haemodialysis patients treated with convalescent plasma,"BackgroundWhen patients with chronic kidney disease are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) they can face two specific problems: Virus-specific immune responses may be impaired and remdesivir, an antiviral drug described to shorten the time to recovery, is contraindicated. Antiviral treatment with convalescent plasma could be an alternative treatment option.

MethodsIn this case series we present two kidney transplant recipients and two patients dependent on haemodialysis who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received convalescent plasma. Antibodies against the spike 1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 were determined sequentially by IgG ELISA and neutralization assay and specific T cell responses by interferon-gamma ELISpot.

ResultsPrior to treatment, in three patients antibodies were undetectable by ELISA (ratio < 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers ([&le;] 1:40). One patient was also negative to the ELISpot and two showed weak responses. After convalescent plasma treatment we observed an increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG ratio and neutralization titer) and of specific T cell responses. After intermittent clinical improvement one kidney transplant recipient again developed typical symptoms at day 12 after treatment and received a second cycle of convalescent plasma treatment. Altogether, three patients clinically improved and could be discharged from hospital. However, one multimorbid female in her early eighties deceased.

ConclusionsOur data suggest that the success of convalescent plasma therapy may only be temporary in patients with chronic kidney disease; which requires an adaptation of the treatment regimen.

416,COVID-19 Test Strategy to Guide Quarantine Interval in University Students,"BACKGROUNDFollowing COVID-19 exposure, the CDC recommends a 10-14 day quarantine for asymptomatic individuals and more recently a 7 day quarantine with a negative PCR test. We performed a university-based prospective student cohort study to determine if early PCR negativity predicts day 14 negativity.

METHODSWe enrolled 101 asymptomatic, quarantining, students, performed nasopharyngeal swabs for viral testing on days 3 or 4, 5, 7, 10 and 14 and determined the proportion of concordant negative results for each day versus day 14 with a two-sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval.

RESULTSOverall, 14 of 90 (16%, 95% CI: 9% - 25%) tested positive while in quarantine, with 7 initial positive tests on day 3 or 4, 5 on day 5, 2 on day 7, and none on day 10 or 14. Rates of concordant negative test results are: day 5 vs. day 14 = 45/50 (90%, 95% CI: 78% - 97%); day 7 vs. day 14 = 47/52 (90%, 95% CI: 79% - 97%); day 10 vs. day 14 = 48/53 (91%, 95% CI:79% - 97%), with no evidence of different negative rates between earlier days and day 14 by McNemars test, p > 0.05.

CONCLUSIONSThe 16% positive rate supports the ongoing need to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases, but this prospective study provides the first direct evidence that exposed asymptomatic students ages 18-44 years in a university setting are at low risk if released from quarantine at 7 days if they test negative PCR test prior to release.",Jill M Kolesar; Tyler Gayheart; Lance Poston; Eric Monday; Derek Forster; Elizabeth Belcher; Rani Jaiswal; J.

DesignObservational and retrospective study over 6 months.

SettingIntensive care unit (ICU) of a high complexity hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

PatientsPatients older than 18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study.

Variables of interestDemographic characteristics such as sex and age, comorbidities, laboratory results, imaging results, ventilatory mechanics data, complications, and mortality were recorded.

ResultsA total of 168 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included. 66% were men with a median age of 65 years (58-75. 79.7% had at least one comorbidity. The most frequent comorbidity was arterial hypertension, affecting 52.4% of the patients. 67.9 % required invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), and no patient was treated with non-invasive ventilation. Most of the patients in MV (73.7%) required neuromuscular blockade due to severe hypoxemia. 36% of patients were ventilated in the prone position.

419,Assessing the Performance of COVID-19 Forecasting Models in the U.S.,"Dozens of coronavirus (COVID-19) forecasting models have been created; however, little information exists on their performance. Here we examine the performance of nine commonly-used COVID-19 forecasting models, as well as equal- and performance-weighted ensembles, based on their knowledge - i.e., accuracy and precision, and their  self-knowledge - i.e.,  calibration and  information. Calibration and information are measures commonly employed in structured expert judgment to assess an experts ability to meaningfully communicate the extent and limits of their knowledge.1 Data on observed COVID-19 mortality in 4 states, selected to reflect differences in racial composition and COVID-19 case rates, over eight weeks in the summer of 2020 provided the basis for evaluating model predictions.

Only two models showed little bias (geometric mean of observed/predicted < 10%) and good precision (geometric standard deviation of observed/predicted < 1.6). Three models demonstrated good calibration and information. However, only one model exhibited superior performance in both dimensions.

Nearly all models under-predicted COVID-19 mortality, some quite substantially. Further, model performance depends on racial composition and case rates, and forecasts in the short-term outperform forecasts in the medium-term on all criteria. The performance-weighted ensembles also outperformed the equal-weighted ensemble on all criteria.

The ability of models to accurately and precisely predict mortality and the ability of the modelers to provide meaningful characterizations of the uncertainty in their estimates are potentially important to model developers and to those using model output to inform decisions.",Kyle J.

420,SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 hospitalised patients in Switzerland: a prospective cohort profile,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, which emerged in China in late 2019, rapidly spread across the world causing several million victims in 213 countries. Switzerland was severely hit by the virus, with 43000 confirmed cases as of September 1st, 2020.

AimIn cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in addition to their mandatory reporting system.

MethodsPatients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive PCR test, from 20 Swiss hospitals, are included. Data collection follows a custom Case Report Form based on WHO recommendations and adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms started more than 5 days after the patients admission date.

ResultsAs of September 1st, 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168 - 59.5%),and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778 - 76.2%), with a median age of 68 (IQR 54-79). Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported: hypertension (1481 - 61.7%), cardiovascular diseases (948 - 39.5%), and diabetes (660 - 27.5%) being the most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4 -21.1%), haematological and oncological diseases (3 - 15.8%) being the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4%) episodes, mostly for respiratory diseases (2470 - 93.2% in adults, 16 - 55.2% in children), renal (681 - 25.7%) and cardiac (631 - 23.8%) complication for adults. The second and third most frequent complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7 - 24.1%). A targeted treatment was given in 1299 (35.6%) episodes, mostly with hydroxychloroquine (989 - 76.1%). Intensive care units stays were reported in 578 (15.8%) episodes. 527 (14.5%) deaths were registered, all among adults.

ConclusionThe surveillance system has been successfully initiated and provides a very representative set of data for Switzerland.

421,Risk of adverse outcomes with COVID-19 in the Republic of Ireland,"AimsTo compare the risk of adverse outcomes (i.e. hospital/intensive care admission, death) in population sub-groups during two periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland.

MethodsWe analysed routinely-collected, publicly-available data on 67,900 people with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection between 29th Feb to 14th Nov 2020. This period encompassed two waves of infection and two corresponding national lockdowns. For two observational periods covering each wave (W1, W2), each ending 17-19 days before implementation of high-level national restrictions, we segmented the population based on age and underlying clinical conditions.

ResultsThe prevalence of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was 1.4%. The risk of admission to hospital, admission to intensive care, and death was 7.2%, 0.9%, and 2.5%, respectively. Compared to younger confirmed cases, those aged [&ge;]65 y had increased risk of hospital admission (RR 5.61), ICU admission (RR 3.56), and death (RR 60.8). W2 was associated with more cases and fewer adverse events than W1. The risk of all adverse outcomes was reduced in W2 than in W1.

DESIGNObservational, retrospective, control study of anti-Receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM titers from serial plasma samples drawn before and after CCP administration. Clinical improvement in CCP recipients is assessed and compared to COVID-19 control patients.

SETTINGPatients hospitalized with severe COVID19, United States, between April 17 and July 19, 2020

PARTICIPANTS34 patients hospitalized with severe or life threatening COVID-19 and who consented and received a CCP transfusion, 95 control patients with COVID-19 not transfused with CCP. 34 out the 95 control patients were matched for age, sex, and the level of respiratory support required. Patients less than 18 years old were excluded.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESSerial trends of anti-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM titers in CCP recipients are compared to those in control patients. The primary outcome is survival at 30 days, and the secondary outcomes are length of ventilatory and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, length of stay (LOS) in the hospital, and LOS in the ICU.

RESULTSCCP transfusion occurred in 34 patients at a median of 12 days following COVID-19 symptom onset. Immediately prior to CCP transfusion, patients median anti-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM titers were 1:3200 (IQR, 1:50 to 1:9600) and 1:320 (IQR, 1:40 to 1:640) respectively. Following a Loess regression analysis, the kinetics and distribution of anti-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in plasma from CCP recipients were comparable to those from a control group of 68 patients who did not receive CCP. CCP recipients presented with similar survival, similar duration on ventilatory and/or ECMO support, as well as ICU and hospital LOS, compared to a matched control group of 34 patients.

424,Impact of Nasopharyngeal Specimen Quality on SARS-CoV-2 Test Performance,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle of threshold (Ct) has been used to estimate quantitative viral load, with the goal of targeting isolation precautions for individuals with COVID-19 and guiding public health interventions. However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct values obtained from SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity.

MethodsWe performed amplification of a human gene target ({beta}-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1311 NP specimens collected from patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP specimen quality, characterized by high Ct values for the human gene target {beta}-actin Ct, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and {beta}-actin Ct.

ResultsLow quality NP swabs are less likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio 0.654, 95%CI 0.523 to 0.802). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and {beta}-actin Ct values (slope 0.169, 95%CI 0.092 to 0.247). COVID-19 disease severity was not associated with {beta}-actin Ct values.

ConclusionsVariability in NP specimen quality accounts for significant differences in the sensitivity of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays. If unrecognized, low quality NP specimens, which are characterized by a low level of amplifiable human DNA target, may limit the application of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to direct infection control and public health interventions.",Melissa Richard-Greenblatt; Matthew J Ziegler; Valerie Bromberg; Elizabeth Huang; Hatem O Abdallah; Pam Tolomeo; Ebbing Lautenbach; Laurel Glaser; Brendan J Kelly,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246520,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246520,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
425,COVID-19 vaccine confidence and hesitancy among healthcare workers: a cross-sectional survey from a MERS-CoV experienced nation,"ObjectivesThis study aimed to identify COVID-19 vaccine perception, acceptance, confidence, hesitancy, and barriers among healthcare workers (HCW).

MethodsAn online national cross-sectional pilot-validated questionnaire was self-administered by HCW in Saudi Arabia, a nation with MERS-CoV experience. The main outcome variable was HCWs acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and the level of anxiety using generalized anxiety disorder 7.

ResultOut of 1512 HCWs who completed the study questionnaire--944 (62.4%) women and 568 (37.6%) men--1058 (70%) were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis revealed that male HCWs (ORa=1.551, 95% CI: 1.122-2.144), HCWs who believe in vaccine safety (ORa=2.151; 95% CI:1.708-2.708), HCWs who believe that COVID vaccines are the most likely way to stop the pandemic (ORa=1.539; 95% CI: 1.259-1.881), and HCWs who rely on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for COVID 19 updates (ORa=1.505, 95% CI: 1.125-2.013) were significantly associated with reporting willingness to be vaccinated. However, HCWs who believed vaccines were rushed without evidence-informed testing were found to be 60% less inclined to accept COVID-19 vaccines (ORa=0.394, 95% CI: 0.298- 0.522).

We examined the association between retirement home and community level characteristics and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in retirement homes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of licensed retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, from March 1st - September 24th, 2020. Our primary outcome was a COVID-19 outbreak ([&ge;]1 resident or staff confirmed case by validated nucleic acid amplification assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations between retirement home and community level characteristics and COVID-19 outbreaks.

ResultsOur cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed 56,491 residents. There were 172 (22.3%) COVID-19 retirement home outbreaks involving 1,045 (1.9%) residents and 548 staff (1.5%). COVID-19 cases were distributed unevenly across retirement homes, with 1,593 (92.2%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) of homes. The adjusted hazard of a COVID-19 outbreak in a retirement home was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, homes that were co-located with a long-term care facility, large corporate owned chains, homes that offered many services onsite, increases in regional COVID-19 incidence, and a higher community-level ethnic concentration.

InterpretationReadily identifiable retirement home-level characteristics are independently associated with COVID-19 outbreaks and may support risk identification.

Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis formation, possess anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, and may be particularly effective for treating patients with COVID-19.

ObjectiveTo evaluate whether initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission is associated with decreased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

DesignObservational cohort study.

SettingNationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.

ParticipantsAll patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection March 1 to July 31, 2020, without a history of therapeutic anticoagulation.

ExposuresProphylactic doses of subcutaneous heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or direct oral anticoagulants.

Main Outcomes and Measures30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation.

ResultsOf 4,297 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 3,627 (84.4%) received prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission. More than 99% (n=3,600) received subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin. We observed 622 deaths within 30 days of admission, 513 among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation. Most deaths (510/622, 82%) occurred during hospitalization. In inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses, cumulative adjusted incidence of mortality at 30 days was 14.3% (95% CI 13.1-15.5) among those receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 18.7% (95% CI 15.1-22.9) among those who did not. Compared to patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those who did had a 27% decreased risk for 30-day mortality (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.81). Similar associations were found for inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation. Quantitative bias analysis demonstrated that results were robust to unmeasured confounding (e-value lower 95% CI 1.77). Results persisted in a number of sensitivity analyses.

428,Conundrum of re-positives COVID-19 cases: A Systematic review of Case reports and Case series,"IntroductionThere have been case reports and case series published for RT PCR positive COVID - 19 cases that became RT PCR negative but subsequently became RT PCR positive after a symptom free interval following a negative RT PCR test. These cases may include re-positive, reactivated and re-infection cases. Hence, the systematic review to summarize and synthesize evidence from all available case series and case reports published was undertaken.

MethodologyThe systematic review of case series and case reports was registered with Prospero with registration number CRD42020210446. PRISMA guidelines were followed for conducting the systematic review. Studies published in English language only were considered for the Systematic Review. Inclusion criteria for studies included case reports and case series which have documented cases of positive RT-PCR after a period of improvement or negative RT PCR. Reviews, opinions and animal studies were excluded. Case reports which described clinical presentation or manifestations of COVID-19 cases were also excluded from the studies. Methodological quality was assessed using modified Murad scale.

ResultsA total of 30 case reports/case series were included in the study, wherein a total of 219 cases were included. In re-positive cases, the age range varied from 10 months to 91 years. The pooled proportion using random effects was 12% with 95% CI from 09% to 15%. Among the re-positives, a total of 57 cases (26%) of the cases had co-morbidities. A total of 51 (23.3%) and 17 (7.8%) re-positive cases had been treated with antivirals and corticosteroids respectively. Among the symptomatic cases, the disease severity was lesser as compared to the initial episode of illness. Only a few studies have confirmed the presence of antibodies after the first episode. The few studies that had done contact tracing of re-positives did not find any positive cases among those in contact with re-positives.

ConclusionThis systematic review presents the review of all the case reports and case series on recurrence of COVID 19 disease. Although limited evidence has been generated due to paucity of such studies and shortcomings in the study designs of case reports and case-series, nonetheless, the evidence generated can still be used in making clinical decisions and framing policy guidelines",Arun K Yadav; Subhadeep Ghosh; Sudhir Dubey,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20223990,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20223990,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
429,Optimal test allocation strategy for COVID-19,"Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infections is key to controlling the spread of the virus and preventing severe disease. A central public health challenge is defining test allocation strategies in the presence of limited resources. Inthis paper, we provide a mathematical framework for defining anoptimal strategy for allocating viral tests. The framework accounts for imperfect test results, selective testing in certain high-risk patient populations, practical constraints in terms of budget and/or total number of available tests, and the purpose of testing. Our method is not only useful for detecting infected cases, but can also be used for long-time surveillance to monitor for new outbreaks, which will be especially important during ongoing vaccine distribution across the world. In our proposed approach, tests can be allocated across population strata defined by symptom severity and other patient characteristics, allowing the test allocation plan to prioritize higher risk patient populations. We illustrate our framework using historical data from the initial wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City. We extend our proposed method to address the challenge of allocating two different types of tests with different costs and accuracy (for example, the expensive but more accurate RT-PCR test versus the cheap but less accurate rapid antigen test), administered under budget constraints. We show how this latter framework can be useful to reopening of college campuses where university administrators are challenged with finite resources for community surveillance. We provide a R Shiny web application allowing users to explore test allocation strategies across a variety of pandemic scenarios. This work can serve as a useful tool for guiding public health decision-making at a community level and adapting to different stages of an epidemic, and it has broader relevance beyond the COVID-19 outbreak.",Jiacong Du; Lauren J Beesley; Seunggeun Lee; Xiang Zhou; Walter Dempsey; Bhramar Mukherjee,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246629,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.20246629,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
430,The trade-off between mobility and vaccination for COVID-19 control: a metapopulation modeling approach,"November 2020 received a string of encouraging results from leading vaccine developers raising hopes for the imminent availability of an effective and safe vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2. In the present work, we discuss the theoretical impact of introducing a vaccine across a range of scenarios. In particular, we investigate how vaccination coverage, efficacy, and delivery time affect the control of the transmission dynamics in comparison to mobility restrictions. The analysis is based on a metapopulation epidemic model structured by risk. We perform a global sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method. Our analysis suggest that the reduction of mobility among patches play a significant role in the mitigation of the disease close to the effect of immunization coverage of 30% achieved in 4 months. Moreover, for an immunization coverage between 20%-50% achieved in the first half of 2021 with a vaccine efficacy between 70%-95%, the percentage reduction in the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is between 30%-50% by the end of 2021 in comparison with the no vaccination scenario.",Fernando Saldana; Jorge X.

431,Will the COVID-19 pandemic lead to a tsunami of suicides? A Swedish nationwide analysis of historical and 2020 data,"BackgroundVarious surveys have documented a negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the populations mental health. There is widespread concern about a surge of suicides, but evidence supporting a link between global pandemics and suicide is very limited. Using historical data from the three major influenza pandemics of the 20th century, and recently released data from the first half of 2020, we aimed to investigate whether an association exists between influenza deaths and suicide deaths.

MethodsAnnual data on influenza death rates and suicide rates were extracted from the Statistical Yearbook of Sweden from 1910-1978, covering the three 20th century pandemics, and from Statistics Sweden for the period from January to June of each year during 2000-2020. COVID-19 death data were available for the first half of 2020. We implemented non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) models to explore if there is a short-term and/or long-term effect of increases and decreases in influenza death rates on suicide rates during 1910-1978. Analyses were done separately for men and women. Descriptive analyses were used for the available 2020 data.

FindingsBetween 1910-1978, there was no evidence of either short-term or long-term significant associations between influenza death rates and changes in suicides. The same pattern emerged in separate analyses for men and women. Suicide rates in January-June 2020 revealed a slight decrease compared to the corresponding rates in January-June 2019 (relative decrease by -1.2% among men and -12.8% among women).

InterpretationWe found no evidence of short or long-term association between influenza death rates and suicide death rates across three 20th century pandemics or during the first six months of 2020 (when the first wave of COVID-19 occurred). Concerns about a substantial increase of suicides may be exaggerated.

432,Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across time and countries,"Understanding the drivers of vaccine acceptance is crucial to the success of COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns. Across 25 national samples from 12 different countries we examined the psychological correlates of willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (total N = 25,334), with a focus on risk perception and trust in a number of relevant actors, both in general and specifically regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Male sex, trust in medical and scientific experts and worry about the virus emerge as the most consistent predictors of reported vaccine acceptance across countries. In a subset of samples we show that these effects are robust after controlling for attitudes towards vaccination in general.

In a cohort of 25 consecutive COVID-19 survivors admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital (76% male), 80% of them had at least one sonographic abnormality of diaphragm muscle structure or function.

Specifically, when compared to established normative data, 76% had reduced diaphragm thickening ratio (impaired contractility), and 20% patients had reduced diaphragm muscle thickness (atrophy).

434,"First and second waves of coronavirus disease-19: A comparative study in hospitalized patients in Reus, Spain","Many countries have seen a two-wave pattern in reported cases of coronavirus disease-19 during the 2020 pandemic, with a first wave during spring followed by the current second wave in late summer and autumn. Empirical data show that the characteristics of the effects of the virus do vary between the two periods. Differences in age range and severity of the disease have been reported, although the comparative characteristics of the two waves still remain largely unknown. Those characteristics are compared in this study using data from two equal periods of 3 and a half months. The first period, between 15th March and 30th June, corresponding to the entire first wave, and the second, between 1st July and 15th October, corresponding to part of the second wave, still present at the time of writing this article. Two hundred and four patients were hospitalized during the first period, and 264 during the second period. Patients in the second wave were younger and the duration of hospitalization and case fatality rate were lower than those in the first wave. In the second wave, there were more children, and pregnant and post-partum women. The most frequent signs and symptoms in both waves were fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cough, and the most relevant comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic neurological diseases. Patients from the second wave more frequently presented renal and gastrointestinal symptoms, were more often treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and corticoids, and less often with invasive mechanical ventilation, conventional oxygen therapy and anticoagulants. Several differences in mortality risk factors were also observed. These results might help to understand the characteristics of the second wave and the behaviour and danger of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mediterranean area and in Western Europe.

435,SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in Saliva Rises Gradually and to Moderate Levels in Some Humans,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings often occurs before symptom onset, therefore testing strategies that can reliably detect people in the early phase of infection are urgently needed. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is especially critical to protect vulnerable populations who require frequent interactions with caretakers. Rapid COVID-19 tests have been proposed as an attractive strategy for surveillance, however a limitation of most rapid tests is their low sensitivity. Low-sensitivity tests are comparable to high sensitivity tests in detecting early infections when two assumptions are met: (1) viral load rises quickly (within hours) after infection and (2) viral load reaches and sustains high levels (>105- 106 RNA copies/mL). However, there are no human data testing these assumptions. In this study, we document a case of presymptomatic household transmission from a healthy young adult to a sibling and a parent. Participants prospectively provided twice-daily saliva samples. Samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR and we measured the complete viral load profiles throughout the course of infection of the sibling and parent. This study provides evidence that in at least some human cases of SARS-CoV-2, viral load rises slowly (over days, not hours) and not to such high levels to be detectable reliably by any low-sensitivity test. Additional viral load profiles from different samples types across a broad demographic must be obtained to describe the early phase of infection and determine which testing strategies will be most effective for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection before transmission can occur.

436,QT Interval Prolongation in Patients Treated for COVID-19,"BackgroundMany of the drugs commonly used for the treatment of COVID-19 cause QT interval prolongation and increase the risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. It has been shown that maintaining serum potassium and magnesium levels above 4 and 3 mg/dL, respectively, would prevent the QTc prolongation.

ObjectiveTo determine if keeping only the serum magnesium level above 3 mg/dL could be considered an effective measure to prevent QTc prolongation in patients with COVID-19 receiving these drugs.

MethodsIn a retrograde observational study, QTc interval was measured in 14 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 before and 3 days after initiation of treatment with either hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir, while their serum magnesium levels were kept [&ge;]3 mg/dL.

ResultsThe baseline QTc interval of 412 (SD 36) ms significantly increased by an average of 34 (95% CI 13 to 55) ms after 3 days of treatment. 5 patients, mostly those with lower serum potassium levels, had QTc prolongation [&ge;]60 ms.

439,"Projecting the impact of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Ontario, Canada","BackgroundResults of phase III vaccine clinical trials against COVID-19, although encouraging and well above initial expectations, have only reported on efficacy against disease and its severity. We evaluated the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreak and disease outcomes in Ontario, Canada.

MethodsWe used an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with COVID-19 characteristics, demographics of Ontario, and age-specific clinical outcomes derived from outbreak data. We implemented a two-dose vaccination program, prioritizing healthcare workers and high-risk individuals, with 40% vaccine coverage and vaccine efficacy of 95% against disease. Vaccines were distributed at a rate of 30 doses per day per 10,000 population with a 6-day schedule per week. We projected the impact of vaccination on attack rates, hospitalizations, and deaths. For scenario analyses, we varied the vaccine efficacy against infection, under the assumption of 5% pre-existing population immunity.

ResultsWith no protection against infection, a two-dose vaccination campaign with a time interval of 21 days between doses reduced attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths by 44.6% (95% CrI: 34.5% - 54.3%), 63.4% (95% CrI: 56.1% - 69.9%), and 70.0% (95% CrI: 62.6% - 75.8%), respectively. These reductions were improved with increased vaccine efficacy against infection, with similar estimated ranges in the corresponding scenarios with a 28-day time interval between vaccine doses.

ConclusionsVaccination can substantially mitigate ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, even when vaccines offer limited protection against infection.

440,Intense and Mild Wave of COVID-19 in The Gambia: a Cohort Analysis,"BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is evolving differently in Africa compared to other regions, with lower transmission and milder clinical presentation. Reasons for this are not fully understood. Recent data from Eastern and Southern Africa suggest that transmission may be higher than measured. Detailed epidemiological data in different African settings is urgently needed.

MethodsWe calculated cumulative rates of SAR-CoV-2 infections per 1,000 people at risk in The Gambia (2.42 million individuals) using publicly available data. We evaluated these rates in a cohort of 1,366 employees working at the MRC Unit The Gambia @LSHTM (MRCG) where systematic surveillance of symptomatic cases and contact tracing was implemented. Cumulative rates among the Gambian population were stratified by age groups and, among MRCG staff, by occupational exposure risk. SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted on oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal samples with consistent sampling and laboratory procedures across cohorts.

FindingsBy September 2020, 3,579 cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 115 deaths had been identified; with 67% of cases detected in August. Among them, 191 cases were MRCG staff; all of them were asymptomatic/mild, with no deaths. The cumulative incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection among MRCG staff (excluding those with occupational exposure risk) was 129 per 1,000, at least 20-fold higher than the estimations based on diagnosed cases in the adult Gambian population.

441,What positives can be taken from the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia?,"ObjectiveTo investigate whether Australians have experienced any positive effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the disruption to society and daily life.

MethodsNational online longitudinal survey. As part of a June 2020 survey, participants (n=1370) were asked  In your life, have you experienced any positive effects from the COVID-19 pandemic (yes/no), with a free-text explanation if yes, and also completed the WHO-Five well-being index. Differences were explored by demographic variables. Free-text responses were thematically coded.

Results960 participants (70%) reported experiencing at least one positive effect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living with others (p=.045) and employment situation (p<.001) at baseline (April), were associated with experiencing positive effects. Individuals working for pay from home were more likely to experience positive effects compared to those who were not working for pay (aOR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.32, 0.63, p<.001), or who were working for pay outside the home (aOR=0.40, 95%CI: 0.28, 0.58, p<.001). Age and education were not associated with positive effects when controlling for employment and household numbers. There was an overall effect of gender (p=.001), where those identifying as female were more likely than males (aOR=1.62, 95%CI: 1.25, 2.09) to report experiencing a positive effect. 54.2% of participants reported a sufficient level of wellbeing, 23.2% low wellbeing and a further 22.6% very low wellbeing. Of those experiencing positives, 945/960 (98%) provided an explanation. The three most common themes were  Family time (33%),  Work flexibility (29%), and  Calmer life (19%).

ConclusionA large proportion of surveyed Australians reported positive effects resulting from changes to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Enhancing these aspects may build community resilience to cope with future pandemic responses. The needs of people living alone, and of those having to work outside the home or who are unemployed, should be considered by health policy makers and employers in future pandemic preparedness efforts, as these groups were least likely to report positive experiences and may be more vulnerable.",Samuel Cornell; Brooke Nickel; Erin Cvejic; Carissa Bonner; Kirsten J McCaffery; Julie Ayre; Tessa Copp; Carys Batcup; Jennifer MJ Isautier; Thomas Dakin; Rachael Dodd,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247346,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247346,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True

443,Airborne magnetic nanoparticles: environmental risk factors for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"ObjectivesTo examine the impact of concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution on the incidence of COVID-19.

MethodsPublicly available data of COVID-19 deaths in March/October 2020 were compared with concentrations of PM2.5 measured in previous years at urban and suburban areas in Thessaloniki. Similar publicly available data of PM2.5 concentrations from Tehran were gathered for comparison. Cross-correlation and Granger causality analysis were performed in order to assess linkage.

ResultsOn the one hand, the mean PM2.5 concentrations in Thessaloniki were significantly higher in the winter, however the magnetic fraction of particulate matter in the autumn is twice its annual average, suggesting that traffic-related emissions alone may not explain the entire variability of PM2.5. On the other hand, it is implied that changes in coronavirus-related deaths follow changes in airborne magnetite, with the correlation between the two data sets being maximized at the lag time of one-month. Further insight is provided by the monthly pattern of PM2.5 mass concentrations in Tehran. We find that air pollution Granger causes COVID-19 deaths (p<0.05).

ConclusionsA significant association has been found between PM2.5 values and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a bunch of regions. Reported links between pollution levels, climate conditions and other factors affecting vulnerability to COVID-19 may instead reflect inhalation exposure to magnetic nanoparticles. A hypothesis has been set that ubiquitous airborne magnetite pollution, together with certain climatic conditions, may promote a longer permanence of the viral particles in the air, thus favoring transmission.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABS{blacktriangleright}{blacktriangleright} Due to their small dimensions, airborne particles are able to penetrate through inhalation into many human organs, from the lungs to the cardiovascular system and the brain, which can threaten our health.

444,Predictors of Physical and Mental Health in Healthcare Teams Working with COVID-19 patients: a scoping review protocol.,"IntroductionAs a result of the current pandemic (COVID-19), many clinical teams are exposed to stressful situations that may lead to physical and mental issues for clinical staff themselves (we exclude the effects of personal infection with the virus). Recent studies suggest some predictors could depend on context, notably country and the type of the health system.

Methods and AnalysisThis protocol was follows using the PRISMA-ScR guideline (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews), which was revised and approved by the research team. This study aims to identify factors and evidence of the physical, behavioural and mental consequences of sustained clinical practice in a continuing pandemic. Our research seeks to fill this gap in the literature, and the results may suggest to governments, healthcare authorities and healthcare providers appropriate measures to mitigate risks to healthcare workers during a pandemic response.

Dissemination and ethicsThe current research design is based on the use of publicly available information and does not require ethical approval. The findings will be disseminated in conferences. Results will be published and additionally shared with relevant local and national authorities.

Strengths and Limitations of the studyThis will be the first scoping review to identify factors and evidence of the physical, behavioural and mental consequences of sustained clinical practice in a continuing pandemic with health impacts for clinical staff.

The search strategy includes six electronic databases with peer-reviewed literature, as well as a broad range of grey literature sources.

Although this study will not require a quality appraisal, which is consistent with the framework proposed by Arksey and OMalley, the current study will formally assess the studies quality.

This scoping review study has been registered with Open Science Framework to enhance its transparency.

The search strategy proposed is broad, but the search strategy is limited to articles published in English, Spanish, Portuguese or Italian.",Nelson Aguirre-Duarte; John Ovretveit; Timothy Kenealy,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247304,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247304,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
445,The COVID University Challenge: a Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points Assessment of the Return of Students to Higher Education Establishments,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted economies and societies throughout the world in 2020. Education was especially affected, with schools and universities widely closed for long periods. People under 25 years have the lowest risk of severe disease but their activities can be key to persistent ongoing community transmission. A challenge arose for how to provide education, including university level, without the activities of students increasing wider community SARS- CoV-2 infections.

We used a Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) framework to assess the risks associated with university student activity and recommend how to mitigate these risks. This tool appealed because it relies on multi-agency collaboration and interdisciplinary expertise and yet is low cost, allowing rapid generation of evidence-based recommendations.

We identified key critical control points associated with university student activities, lifestyle and interaction patterns both on-and-off campus. Unacceptable contact thresholds and the most up-to-date guidance were used to identify levels of risk for potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as well as recommendations based on existing research and emerging evidence for strategies that can reduce the risks of transmission. Employing the preventative measures we suggest can reduce the risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among and from university students. Reduction of infectious disease transmission in this demographic will reduce overall community transmission, lower demands on health services and reduce risk of harm to clinically vulnerable individuals while allowing vital education activity to continue. HACCP assessment proved a flexible tool for risk analysis in a specific setting in response to an emerging infectious disease threat.",Kelly L Edmunds; Laura Bowater; Julii S Brainard; Jean-Charles de Coriolis; Iain R Lake; Rimsha R Malik; Lorraine Newark; Neil Ward; Kay Yeoman; Paul R Hunter,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247676,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247676,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
446,Diverse Functional Autoantibodies in Patients with COVID-19,"COVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are characterized by exaggerated and misdirected host immune responses1-8. While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease1, the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP) to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (the ""exoproteome""). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary, these findings implicate a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.",Eric Y.

447,Comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics in New Zealand,"ObjectivesCirculating antibodies are important markers of previous infection and immunity. Questions remain with respect to the durability and functionality of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This study explored antibody responses in recovered COVID-19 patients in a setting where the probability of re-exposure is effectively nil, owing to New Zealands successful elimination strategy.

MethodsA triplex bead-based assay that detects antibody isotype (IgG, IgM and IgA) and subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) responses against Nucleocapsid (N) protein, Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was developed. After establishing baseline levels with pre-pandemic control sera (n=113), samples from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease (n=189) collected up to eight months post-infection were examined. The relationship between antigen-specific antibodies and neutralising antibodies (NAbs) was explored with a surrogate neutralisation assay that quantifies inhibition of the RBD/hACE-2 interaction.

ResultsWhile most individuals had broad isotype and subclass responses to each antigen shortly after infection, only RBD and S protein IgG, as well as NAbs, were stable over the study period, with 99%, 96% and 90% of samples, respectively, having responses over baseline 4-8 months post-infection. Anti-RBD antibodies were strongly correlated with NAbs at all time points (Pearsons r [&ge;] 0.87) and feasibility of using finger prick sampling to accurately measure anti-RBD IgG was demonstrated.

ConclusionAntibodies to SARS-CoV-2 persist for up to eight months following mild to moderate infection. This robust response can be attributed to the initial exposure without immune boosting given the lack of community transmission in our setting.",Alana L Whitcombe; Reuben McGregor; Alyson Craigie; Alex James; Richard Charlewood; Natalie Lorenz; James M J Dickson; Campbell R Sheen; Barbara Koch; Shivani Fox-Lewis; Gary McAuliffe; Sally A Roberts; Susan C Morpeth; Susan Taylor; Rachel H Webb; Susan Jack; Arlo Upton; James Ussher; Nicole J Moreland,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20246751,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20246751,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
448,SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity at the binding sites of oligonucleotides used for COVID-19 diagnosis,"ImportanceSARS-CoV-2 genomic variants impacts the overall sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis, leading to false-negative diagnosis and the continued spread of the virus.

ObjectiveTo evaluate how nucleotide variability in target primer binding sites of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes may impact diagnosis using different recommended primer/probe sets, as well as to suggest the best primer/probes for diagnosis.

DesignWe downloaded 105,118 public SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID (Sept, 25th, 2020), removed genomes of apparent worst quality (genome length <29kb and/or >5% ambiguous bases) and missing metadata, and performed an analysis of complementarity for the 13 most used diagnostic primers/probe sets for RT-PCR detection. We calculated the N rate and % of genome recovery, with all primer/probe-sets considering viral origin and clade. Results: Our findings indicate that currently, the Paris_nCoV-IP2, -IP4 and WHO|E_Sarbeco primer/probe sets for COVID-19, to perform the best diagnostically worldwide, recovering >99.5% of the good quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID, with no mismatches. The Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP primer/probe set, among the first to be designed during the pandemic, was the most susceptible to currently most abundant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Mismatches encompassing the binding sites for this set are more frequent in Clade-GR and are highly prevalent in over 30 countries globally, including Brazil and India, two of the hardest hit countries. Conclusions: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients may be hampered by significant variability in parts of the viral genome that are targeted by some widely used primer sets. The geographic distribution of different viral clades indicates that continuous assessment of primer sets via sequencing-based surveillance and viral evolutionary analysis is critical to accurate diagnostics. This study highlights sequence variance in target regions that may reduce the efficiency of primer:target hybridization that in turn may lead to the undetected spread of the virus. As such, due to this variance, the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP-set should be used with caution, or avoided, especially in countries with high prevalence of the GR clade.

Key Points

QuestionHow variable are the binding-sites of primers/probes used for COVID-19 diagnosis?

FindingsWe investigated nucleotide variations in primer-binding sites used for COVID-19 diagnosis, in 93,143 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and found primer sets targeting regions of increasingly nucleotide variance over time, such as the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP. The frequency of these variations is higher in Clade-GR whose frequency is increasing worldwide. Paris_nCoV-IP2, IP4 and WHO|E_Sarbeco performed best.

449,Development And Performance Evaluation of A Rapid In-House ELISA for Retrospective Serosurveillance of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundIn the ongoing pandemic situation of COVID-19, serological tests can complement the molecular diagnostic methods, and can be one of the important tools of sero-surveillance and vaccine evaluation.

AimTo develop and evaluate a rapid SARS-CoV-2 specific ELISA for detection of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG from patients biological samples.

MethodsIn order to develop the ELISA, three panels of samples (n=184) have been used: panel 1 (n=19) and panel 2 (n=60) were collected from RT-PCR positive patients within 14 and after 14 days of onset of clinical symptoms respectively, whereas panel 3 consisted of negative samples (n=105) collected either from healthy donors or pre-pandemic dengue patients. As a capturing agent full-length SARS-CoV2 specific recombinant nucleocapsid was immobilized. Commercial SARS-CoV2 IgG kit based on chemiluminescent assay was used for the selection of samples and optimization of the assay. The threshold cut-off point, inter-assay and intra-assay variations were determined. The total assay time for this in-house ELISA was set for 30 minutes.

ResultsThe assay time was set at a total of 30 minutes with the sensitivity of 84% (95% confidence interval, CI, 60.4%, 96.6%) and 98% (95% CI, 91.1%, 100.0%), for panel 1 and 2 respectively, with over all 94.9% sensitivity (95% CI 87.5%, 98.6%). Moreover, the clinical specificity is 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9%, 99.4%) with no cross reaction with dengue sample. The overall positive and negative predictive values are 96.2% (95% CI 89.2%, 99.2%) and 96.2% (95% CI, 90.6% 99.0%) respectively. In-house ELISA demonstrated 100% positive and negative percent agreement with ROCHE (Elecsys; Anti-SARS-CoV-2), with a Cohens kappa value of 1.00 (very strong agreement), while comparing 13 positive and 17 negative confirmed cases.

ConclusionThe assay is rapid and can be applied as one of the early and retrospective sero-monitoring tools in all over the affected areas.",Bijon Kumar Sil; Mumtarin Jannat Oishee; Md.

450,Environmental monitoring shows SARS-CoV-2 contamination of surfaces in food plants,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented new challenges to food manufacturers. In addition to preventing the spread of microbial contamination of food, with SARS-CoV-2, there is an additional focus on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in food plant personnel. During the early phase of the pandemic, several large outbreaks of Covid-19 occurred in food manufacturing plants resulting in deaths and economic loss. In March of 2020, we assisted in implementation of environmental monitoring programs for SARS-CoV-2 in 116 food production facilities. All participating facilities had already implemented measures to prevent symptomatic personnel from coming to work. During the study period, from March 17, 2020 to September 3, 2020, 1.23% of the 22,643 environmental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that infected individuals are actively shedding virus. Virus contamination was commonly found on frequently touched surfaces. Most plants managed to control their environmental contamination when they became aware of the positive findings. Comparisons of the personnel test results to environmental contamination in one plant showed a good correlation between the two. Our work illustrates that environmental monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a surrogate for identifying the presence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic personnel in workplaces and may aid in controlling infection spread.

451,COVID-19 prediction in South Africa: Understanding the unascertained cases -- the hidden part of the epidemiological iceberg,"BackgroundUnderstanding the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a critical epidemiological problem in South Africa that reported the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from the African continent.

MethodsIn this study, we applied two existing epidemiological models, an extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model (eSIR) and SAPHIRE, to fit the daily ascertained infected (and removed) cases from March 15 to July 31 in South Africa. To combine the desirable features from the two models, we further extended the eSIR model to an eSEIRD model.

ResultsUsing the eSEIRD model, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics in South Africa was characterized by the estimated basic reproduction number (R0) at 2.10 (95%CI: [2.09,2.10]). The decrease of effective reproduction number with time implied the effectiveness of interventions. The low estimated ascertained rate was found to be 2.17% (95%CI: [2.15%, 2.19%]) in the eSEIRD model. The overall infection fatality ratio (IFR) was estimated as 0.04% (95%CI: [0.02%, 0.06%]) while the reported case fatality ratio was 4.40% (95% CI: [<0.01%, 11.81%]). As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative number of ascertained cases and total infected would reach roughly 801 thousand and 36.9 million according to the long-term forecasting.

ConclusionsThe dynamics based on our models suggested a decline of COVID-19 infection and that the severeness of the epidemic might be largely mitigated through strict interventions. Besides providing insights on the COVID-19 dynamics in South Africa, we develop powerful forecasting tools that allow incorporating ascertained rate and IFR estimation and inquiring into the effect of intervention measures on COVID-19 spread.

452,Mathematical modelling projections versus the actual course of the COVID-19 epidemic following the nationwide lockdown in Kyrgyzstan,"Kyrgyzstan was placed under a two-month, nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic, starting on March 25, 2020. Given the highly disruptive effects of the lockdown on the national economy and peoples lives, the government decided not to extend lockdown beyond the initially planned date of May 10, 2020. The strategy chosen by the government was close to the input parameters of our models baseline scenario,  full lockdown release, which we presented to policymakers in April 2020, along with various other hypothetical scenarios with managed lockdown release options. To explore whether our model could accurately predict the actual course of the epidemic following the release of lockdown, we compared the outputs of the baseline scenario, such as new cases, deaths, and demand for and occupancy of hospital beds, with actual official reports. Our analysis revealed that the model could accurately predict the timing of the epidemic peak, with a difference of just two weeks, although the magnitude of the peak was overestimated compared with the official statistics. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of the official reports remains debatable, so outputs relating to the size of the epidemic and related pressures on the health system will need to be updated if new evidence becomes available.",Ainura Moldokmatova; Aida Estebesova; Aizhan Dooronbekova; Chynar Zhumalieva; Aibek Mukambetov; Talant Abdyldaev; Aisuluu Kubatova; Shamil Ibragimov; Nurbolot Usenbaev; Ainura Kutmanova; Lisa J White,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247247,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20247247,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
453,Did people really drink bleach to prevent COVID-19? A tale of problematic respondents and a guide for measuring rare events in survey data,"Society is becoming increasingly dependent on survey research. However, surveys can be impacted by participants who are non-attentive, respond randomly to survey questions, and misrepresent who they are and their true attitudes. The impact that such respondents can have on public health research has rarely been systematically examined. In this study we examine whether Americans began to engage in dangerous cleaning practices to avoid Covid-19 infection. Prior reports have suggested that people began to engage in highly dangerous cleaning practices during the Covid-19 pandemic, including ingesting household cleansers such as bleach. In a series of studies totaling close to 1400 respondents, we show that 80-90% of reports of household cleanser ingestion are made by problematic respondents. These respondents report impossible claims such as  recently having had a fatal heart attack and  eating concrete for its iron content at a similar rate to ingesting household cleaners. Additionally, respondents frequent misreading or misinterpreting the intent of questions accounted for the rest of such claims. Once inattentive, mischievous, and careless respondents are taken out of the analytic sample we find no evidence that people ingest cleansers. The relationship between dangerous cleaning practices and health outcomes also becomes non-significant once problematic respondents are taken out of the analytic sample. These results show that reported ingestion of household cleaners and other similar dangerous practices are an artifact of problematic respondent bias. The implications of these findings for public health and medical survey research, as well as best practices for avoiding problematic respondents in surveys are discussed.",Leib Litman; Zohn Rosen; Cheskie Ronsezweig; Sarah L.

454,Understanding patterns of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation measures: A qualitative interview study.,"In an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the UK government has introduced a series of mitigation measures. The success of these measures in preventing transmission is dependent on adherence, which is currently considered to be low. Evidence highlights the disproportionate impact of mitigation measures on individuals from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, as well as among those on a low income, and an understanding of barriers to adherence in these populations is needed. In this qualitative study we examined patterns of adherence to mitigation measures and reasons underpinning these behaviors among people on low income and those from BAME communities.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants from BAME and low-income White backgrounds. The topic guide was designed to explore how individuals are adhering to social distancing and self-isolation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore in detail the reasons underpinning this behavior. Data were analyzed using  thematic analysis following which charts were used to help compare concepts within and between participants and develop an understanding of patterns of adherence.

Participants were confused by the constantly changing and seemingly contradictory rules and guidance. As a result, decisions were made about how best to protect themselves and their household from COVID-19, and from the detrimental impact of lockdown restrictions. This was not always in line with government advice. We identified three categories of adherence to lockdown measures 1) caution motivated super-adherence 2) risk-adapted partial-adherence and 3) necessity-driven partial-adherence. Decisions about adherence considered potential for exposure to the virus, ability to reduce risk through use of protective measures, and perceived importance of/need for the behavior.

This research highlights a need for a more nuanced understanding of adherence to lockdown measures. Provision of practical and financial support could reduce the number of people who have to engage in necessity-driven partial-adherence. Information about viral transmission could help people assess the risk associated with partial-adherence more accurately. More evidence is required on population level risks of people adopting risk-adapted partial-adherence.",Sarah Denford; Kate S Morton; Helen Lambert; Juan Zhang; Louise E.

455,Addressing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Decontamination: Methylene Blue and Light Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 on N95 Respirators and Masks with Maintenance of Integrity and Fit,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary to protect front-line healthcare personnel. These shortages underscore the urgent need for simple, efficient, and inexpensive methods to decontaminate SARS-CoV-2-exposed PPE enabling safe reuse of masks and respirators. Efficient decontamination must be available not only in low-resourced settings, but also in well-resourced settings affected by PPE shortages. Methylene blue (MB) photochemical treatment, hitherto with many clinical applications including those used to inactivate virus in plasma, presents a novel approach for widely applicable PPE decontamination. Dry heat (DH) treatment is another potential low-cost decontamination method.

MethodsMB and light (MBL) and DH treatments were used to inactivate coronavirus on respirator and mask material. We tested three N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), two medical masks (MMs), and one cloth community mask (CM). FFR/MM/CM materials were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (a Betacoronavirus), murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (a Betacoronavirus), or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (an Alphacoronavirus), and treated with 10 {micro}M MB followed by 50,000 lux of broad-spectrum light or 12,500 lux of red light for 30 minutes, or with 75{degrees}C DH for 60 minutes. In parallel, we tested respirator and mask integrity using several standard methods and compared to the FDA-authorized vaporized hydrogen peroxide plus ozone (VHP+O3) decontamination method. Intact FFRs/MMs/CM were subjected to five cycles of decontamination (5CD) to assess integrity using International Standardization Organization (ISO), American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) test methods.

FindingsOverall, MBL robustly and consistently inactivated all three coronaviruses with at least a 4-log reduction. DH yielded similar results, with the exception of MHV, which was only reduced by 2-log after treatment. FFR/MM integrity was maintained for 5 cycles of MBL or DH treatment, whereas one FFR failed after 5 cycles of VHP+O3. Baseline performance for the CM was variable, but reduction of integrity was minimal.

InterpretationMethylene blue with light and DH treatment decontaminated masks and respirators by inactivating three tested coronaviruses without compromising integrity through 5CD. MBL decontamination of masks is effective, low-cost and does not require specialized equipment, making it applicable in all-resource settings. These attractive features support the utilization and continued development of this novel PPE decontamination method.",Thomas S Lendvay; James Chen; Brian H Harcourt; Florine E.M. Scholte; F.

456,Implementation of novel and conventional outbreak control measures in managing a COVID-19 outbreak in a large UK prison,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 can spread rapidly within correctional facilities. On, following identification of a confirmed COVID-19 case in a prisoner in Prison A (UK), an Outbreak Control Team was convened consisting of prison staff and public health experts from Public Health England and the UK National Health Service.

MethodsAt the start of the outbreak, four prisoners and 40 staff were isolating with COVID-19 symptoms. An outbreak was declared and full prison lockdown implemented.

Prompt implementation of novel outbreak control measures prevented an explosive prison outbreak, specifically establishment of dedicated isolation and cohorting units, including (i) Reverse Cohorting Units (RCUs) for accommodating new detainees; (ii) Protective Isolation Units (PIUs) for isolating symptomatic prisoners (new detainees and existing residents), and (iii) Shielding Units (SUs) to protect medically vulnerable prisoners.

FindingsIn total, 120 probable and 25 confirmed cases among prisoners and staff were recorded between. Among prisoners, there were six possible, 79 probable, and three confirmed cases. Among staff, there were 83 possible, 79 probable, and 22 confirmed cases. Testing of symptomatic prisoners was limited for most of the outbreak, with only 33% of probable cases tested. This explains the low number of confirmed cases (three) among prisoners despite the large number of probable cases (n=81; 92%). Over 50% of the initial cases among prisoners were on the two wings associated with the index case.

InterpretationRapid transmission of SARS-COV-2 was prevented through proactive steps in identifying and isolating infected prisoners (and staff), cohorting new admissions and shielding vulnerable individuals. These novel and cost-effective approaches can be implemented in a wide range of correctional facilities globally and proved effective even in the absence of mass testing.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA systematic literature search on Pubmed from database inception to October 2020 was conducted. The broad terms included were ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-COV-2"" OR ""coronavirus"" AND ""prison"" OR ""correctional facility"" OR ""place of detention"" OR ""penitentiary"" OR ""detention centre"". There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists and forward citations of all articles pertinent to the study objectives. We identified 122 results. Only two prison outbreak reports were identified, both focusing on prisons in the USA. Outbreak guidance identified during the literature review was typically adapted from other institutional settings such as care homes and hospital, with a focus on self-isolation, social distancing, reduced admissions and rapid testing. Many of these features form the basis of CDC, WHO and ECDC prison outbreak guidance. However, these measures have not proven effective in many countries, resulting in major and sustained COVID-19 outbreaks in regions such as the USA and South America. Therefore, alternative and cost-effective approaches need to be considered to reduce the transmission of SARS-COV-2.

Added value of this studyThis study outlines novel outbreak control measures (not reported elsewhere in the literature), that were clearly efficacious in preventing the rapid transmission of SARS-COV-2 in a large UK prison. These include: (1) the timely establishment of ""Reverse Cohorting Units"" to accommodate new prison admissions, allowing emergent infectious cases to be detected before entering the general population; (2) ""Protective Isolation Units"" for accommodating confirmed / suspected cases and (3) ""Shielding Units"" to protect prisoners most at risk from COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe innovative and cost-effective interventions presented here proved effective in controlling the spread of SARS-COV-2, even in the absence of mass testing. The best defence against incursions of future infection into global prisons is implementation of strict outbreak control measures, specifically the screening and quarantining of new prison admissions.",Paul Coleman; Roger Gajraj; Joht Singh Chandan; Anjana Roy; Victoria Lumby; Anna Taylor; Paul Newton; Jonathan Swindells,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20234641,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20234641,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
457,"An emergency system for monitoring pulse oximetry, peak expiratory flow and body temperature of patients with COVID-19 at home: Development and preliminary application","BackgroundCOVID-19 is characterized by a rapid change in the patients condition, with major changes occurring over a few days. Our aim was to develop and evaluate an emergency system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients stay in their homes.

Methodology/Principal findingsThe system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patients condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW(R) environment that is able to provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation (SpO2), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and 12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented reduced SpO2 (p<0.0001) and increased BPM values (p<0.0001). Three patients (25%) presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored patients presented events of desaturation (SpO2<92%). The experimental results were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidences that the proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19.

ConclusionsAn emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in these patients. This system may contribute to conserve hospital resources for those most in need, while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute deterioration, requiring urgent assessment.",Leonardo P Motta; Pedro P F Silva; Bruno M Borguezan; Jorge L M Amaral; Lucimar G Milagres; Marcio N Boia; Marcos R Ferraz; Roberto Mogami; Rodolfo A Nunes; Pedro Lopes de Melo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247650,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247650,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
458,Potential role of aberrant mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in pathogenesis of IgA Nephropathy,"Aberrant mucosal immunity has been suggested to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a global concern. However, whether the mucosal immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 influences the clinical manifestations of IgAN patients remains unknown. Here we tracked the SARS-CoV-2 anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels in a cohort of 88 COVID-19 patients. We found that 52.3% of the COVID-19 patients produced more SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgA than IgG or IgM, and the levels of the IgA were stable during 4-41 days of infection. Among these IgA-dominated COVID-19 patients, we found a severe COVID-19 patient concurrent with IgAN. The renal function of the patient declined presenting with increased serum creatinine during the infection and till 7 months post infection. This patient predominantly produced anti-RBD IgA as well as total IgA in the serum compared to that of healthy controls. The analysis of the IgA-coated microbiota as well as proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, which was mainly produced in the intestine, reveals intestinal inflammation, although no obvious gastrointestinal symptom was reported. The mucosal immune responses in the lung are not evaluated due to the lack of samples from respiratory tract. Collectively, our work highlights the potential adverse effect of the mucosal immune response towards SARS-CoV-2, and additional care should be taken for COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases like IgAN.",Zhao Zhang; Guorong Zhang; Meng Guo; Wanyin Tao; Xingzi Liu; Haiming Wei; Tengchuan Jin; Yuemiao Zhang; Shu Zhu,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247668,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247668,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,True
459,IGI-LuNER: single-well multiplexed RT-qPCR test for SARS-CoV-2,"Commonly used RT-qPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics require 2-3 separate reactions or rely on detection of a single viral target, adding time and cost or risk of false-negative results. Currently, no test combines detection of widely used SARS-CoV-2 E- and N-gene targets and a sample control in a single, multiplexed reaction. We developed the IGI-LuNER RT-qPCR assay using the Luna Probe Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix with publicly available primers and probes to detect SARS-CoV-2 N gene, E gene, and human RNase P (NER). This combined, cost-effective test can be performed in 384-well plates with detection sensitivity suitable for clinical reporting, and will aid in future sample pooling efforts, thus improving throughput of SARS-CoV-2 detection.

460,EVs analysis in the COVID-19 era: insights on serum inactivation protocols towards downstream isolation and analysis,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 crisis, the handling of biological samples from known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals demanded the use of inactivation protocols aimed at ensuring laboratory operators safety. While not standardized, these practices can be roughly divided in two categories, namely heat inactivation and solvent-detergent treatments. As such, these routine procedures should also apply to samples intended for Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) analysis. Assessing the impact of virus inactivating pre-treatments is therefore of pivotal importance, given the well-known variability introduced by different pre-analytical steps on downstream EVs isolation and analysis. Common guidelines on inactivation protocols tailored to best address EVs-specific requirements will be likely needed among the EVs community, yet deep investigations in this direction havent been reported so far.

In the attempt of sparking interest on this highly relevant topic, we here provide preliminary insights on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation practices to be adopted prior serum EVs analysis by comparing solvent/detergent treatment vs. heat inactivation. Our analysis entailed the evaluation of EVs recovery and purity along with biochemical, biophysical and biomolecular profiling by means of Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, Western Blotting, Atomic Force Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, miRNA content (digital droplet PCR) and tetraspanin assessment by antibody microarrays. Our data suggest an increase in ultracentrifugation (UC) recovery following heat-treatment, however accompanied by a marked enrichment in EVs-associated contaminants. On the contrary, solvent/detergent treatment is promising for small EVs (< 150nm range), yet a depletion of larger vesicular entities was detected. This work represents a first step towards the identification of optimal bio-samples inactivation protocols targeted to EVs analysis.",Roberto Frigerio; Marco Brucale; Andrea Ridolfi; Silvia Galbiati; Riccardo Vago; Greta Bergamaschi; Anna Ferretti; Marcella Chiari; Francesco Valle; Alessandro Gori; Marina Cretich,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.417758,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.417758,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,False
461,Duplex formation between the template and the nascent strand in the transcription-regulating sequences determines the site of template switching in SARS - CoV-2,"Recently published transcriptomic data of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus show that there is a large variation in the frequency and steady state levels of subgenomic mRNA sequences. This variation is derived from discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis where the polymerase switches template from a 3 proximal genome body sequence to a 5 untranslated leader sequence. This leads to a fusion between the common 5 leader sequence and a 3 proximal body sequence in the RNA product. This process revolves around a common core sequence (CS) that is present at both the template sites that make up the fusion junction. Base-pairing between the leader CS and the nascent complementary minus strand body CS, and flanking regions (together called the transcription regulating sequence, TRS) is vital for this template switching event. However, various factors can influence the site of template switching within the same TRS duplex. Here, we model the duplexes formed between the leader and complementary body TRS regions, hypothesising the role of the stability of the TRS duplex in determining the major sites of template switching for the most abundant mRNAs. We indicate that the stability of secondary structures and the speed of transcription play key roles in determining the probability of template switching in the production of subgenomic RNAs.",Amanda B Buckingham; Fanny Salasc; Gennaro Iaconis; Isobel Jarvis; Harriet C T Groom; Julia Kenyon; Andrew M L Lever,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.416818,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.416818,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,False
462,Conformational Ensembles of Non-Coding Elements in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome from Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"The 5 untranslated region (UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 genome is a conserved, functional and structured genomic region consisting of several RNA stem-loop elements. While the secondary structure of such elements has been determined experimentally, their three-dimensional structure is not known yet. Here, we predict structure and dynamics of five RNA stem-loops in the 5-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 by extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, more than 0.5ms of aggregate simulation time, in combination with enhanced sampling techniques. We compare simulations with available experimental data, describe the resulting conformational ensembles, and identify the presence of specific structural rearrengements in apical and internal loops that may be functionally relevant. Our atomic-detailed structural predictions reveal a rich dynamics in these RNA molecules, could help the experimental characterisation of these systems, and provide putative three-dimensional models for structure-based drug design studies.",Sandro Bottaro; Giovanni Bussi; Kresten Lindorff-Larsen,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.421784,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.421784,2020-12-11,2020-12-11,,False
463,BNT162b vaccines are immunogenic and protect non-human primates against SARS-CoV-2,"A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed in quantities sufficient to immunise large populations. We report the preclinical development of two BNT162b vaccine candidates, which contain lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-derived immunogens. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted, trimerised receptor-binding domain (RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane spike glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation (P2 S). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the P 2S trimers are in the two-RBD  down, one-RBD  up state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong TH1 CD4+ and IFN{gamma}+ CD8+ T-cell responses. Prime/boost vaccination of rhesus macaques with BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titres 8.2 to 18.2 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. The vaccine candidates protect macaques from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with BNT162b2 protecting the lower respiratory tract from the presence of viral RNA and with no evidence of disease enhancement. Both candidates are being evaluated in phase 1 trials in Germany and the United States. BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global, pivotal Phase 2/3 trial (NCT04380701, NCT04368728).",Annette B. Vogel; Isis Kanevsky; Ye Che; Kena A.

464,Profound Treg perturbations correlate with COVID-19 severity,"The hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease has been an uncontrolled inflammatory response, resulting from poorly understood immunological dysfunction. We explored the hypothesis that perturbations in FoxP3+ T regulatory cells (Treg), key enforcers of immune homeostasis, contribute to COVID-19 pathology. Cytometric and transcriptomic profiling revealed a distinct Treg phenotype in severe COVID-19 patients, with an increase in both Treg proportions and intracellular levels of the lineage-defining transcription factor FoxP3, which correlated with poor outcomes. Accordingly, these Tregs over-expressed a range of suppressive effectors, but also pro-inflammatory molecules like IL32. Most strikingly, they acquired similarity to tumor-infiltrating Tregs, known to suppress local anti-tumor responses. These traits were most marked in acute patients with severe disease, but persisted somewhat in convalescent patients. These results suggest that Tregs may play nefarious roles in COVID-19, via suppressing anti-viral T cell responses during the severe phase of the disease, and/or via a direct pro-inflammatory role.",Silvia Galvan-Pena; Juliette Leon; Kaitavjeet Chowdhary; Daniel A.

We investigated the potential anti-coronavirus activities from an oral liquid of traditional medicine, Respiratory Detox Shot (RDS), which contains mostly herbal ingredients traditionally used to manage lung diseases. Here we report that RDS inhibited the infection of target cells by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, and by infectious wild-type SARS-CoV-2.

467,Untargeted metabolomics of COVID-19 patient serum reveals potential prognostic markers of both severity and outcome.,"The diagnosis of COVID-19 is normally based on the qualitative detection of viral nucleic acid sequences. Properties of the host response are not measured but are key in determining outcome. Although metabolic profiles are well suited to capture host state, existing metabolomics studies are either underpowered, measure only a restricted subset of metabolites ( targeted metabolomics), compare infected individuals against uninfected control cohorts that are not suitably matched, or do not provide a compact predictive model.

We here provide a well-powered, untargeted metabolomics assessment of 120 COVID-19 patient samples acquired at hospital admission. The study aims to predict patients infection severity (i.e. mild or severe) and potential outcome (i.e. discharged or deceased).

High resolution untargeted LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on patient serum using both positive and negative ionization. A subset of 20 intermediary metabolites predictive of severity or outcome were selected based on univariate statistical significance and a multiple predictor Bayesian logistic regression model. The predictors were selected for their relevant biological function and include cytosine (reflecting viral load), kynurenine (reflecting host inflammatory response), nicotinuric acid, and multiple short chain acylcarnitines (energy metabolism) among others.

Currently, this approach predicts outcome and severity with a Monte Carlo cross validated area under the ROC curve of 0.792 (SD 0.09) and 0.793 (SD 0.08), respectively.

For samples with higher viral loads (cycle threshold value under 33, based on the CDC qPCR assay) complete genomes were generated. Analysis of junction reads revealed regions of differential transcriptional activity and provided evidence of expression of ORF10.

469,Social Media Insights Into US Mental Health Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. A Longitudinal Twitter Analysis (JANUARY-APRIL 2020),"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions. Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a significant challenge to the worlds mental health and healthcare systems. Considering traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our populations mental health. Significant pluralities of the US population now use social media platforms, such as Twitter, to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field from which to understand personal wellbeing.

PurposeBroadly, this study answers three research questions: RQ1: What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19?; RQ2: To what extent does social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic?; and RQ3: Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?

MethodsWe analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English-language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps1. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n = 354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment tool2.

ResultsLDA topics generated in the early months of the dataset corresponded to major COVID-19 specific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted towards US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis sentiment scores of user timelines were initially high and stable, but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March.

Discussion & ConclusionOur findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased usage rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media usage on mental health, for many social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental healthcare structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.",Danny Valdez; Marijn ten Thij; Krishna C Bathina; Laruen A Rutter; Johan Bollen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.01.20241943,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.01.20241943,2020-12-10,2020-12-10,,True
470,"SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in human airway epithelial cells using a mucoadhesive, amphiphilic chitosan that may serve as an anti-viral nasal spray","There are currently no cures for coronavirus infections, making the prevention of infections the only course open at the present time. The COVID-19 pandemic has been difficult to prevent, as the infection is spread by respiratory droplets and thus effective, scalable and safe preventive interventions are urgently needed. We hypothesise that preventing viral entry into mammalian nasal epithelial cells may be one way to limit the spread of COVID-19. Here we show that N-palmitoyl-N-monomethyl-N,N-dimethyl-N,N,N-trimethyl-6-O-glycolchitosan (GCPQ), a positively charged polymer that has been through an extensive Good Laboratory Practice toxicology screen, is able to reduce the infectivity of SARS-COV-2 in A549ACE2+ and Vero E6 cells with a log removal value of -3 to -4 at a concentration of 10 - 100 g/ mL (p < 0.05 compared to untreated controls) and to limit infectivity in human airway epithelial cells at a concentration of 500 g/ mL (p < 0.05 compared to untreated controls). GCPQ is currently being developed as a pharmaceutical excipient in nasal and ocular formulations. GCPQs electrostatic binding to the virus, preventing viral entry into the host cells, is the most likely mechanism of viral inhibition. Radiolabelled GCPQ studies in mice show that at a dose of 10 mg/ kg, GCPQ has a long residence time in mouse nares, with 13.1% of the injected dose identified from SPECT/CT in the nares, 24 hours after nasal dosing.

471,"A single dose, BCG-adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induces Th1-polarized immunity and high-titre neutralizing antibodies in mice","Next-generation vaccines that are safe, effective and with equitable access globally are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission at a population level. One strategy that has gained significant interest is to  repurpose existing licensed vaccines for use against COVID-19. In this report, we have exploited the immunostimulatory properties of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the vaccine for tuberculosis, to develop a SARS-CoV-2-specific and highly immunogenic vaccine candidate. Combination of BCG with a stabilized, trimeric form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen promoted rapid development of virus-specific IgG antibodies in the sera of vaccinated mice, which could be further augmented by the addition of alum. This vaccine formulation, termed BCG:CoVac, induced a Th1-biased response both in terms of IgG antibody subclass and cytokine release by vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A single dose of BCG:CoVac was sufficient to induce high-titre SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that were detectable as early as 2 weeks post-vaccination; NAb levels were greater than that seen in the sera of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Boosting of BCG:CoVac-primed mice with a heterologous vaccine combination (spike protein plus alum) could further increase SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibody response. BCG:CoVac would be broadly applicable for all populations susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and in particular could be readily incorporated into current vaccine schedules in countries where BCG is currently used.

ImportanceEffective distribution of vaccine to low- and middle-income countries is critical for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, vaccines must offer effective protective immunity yet should be cheap to manufacture and meet cold chain management requirements. This study describes a unique COVID-19 vaccine candidate, termed BCG:CoVac, that when delivered as a single dose induces potent SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity in mice, particularly through generation of high-titre, anti-viral neutralising antibodies. BCG:CoVac is built on safe and well-characterised vaccine components: 1) the BCG vaccine, used for control of tuberculosis since 1921 which also has remarkable  off target effects, protecting children and the elderly against diverse respiratory viral infections; 2) Alhydrogel adjuvant (Alum), a low cost, globally accessible vaccine adjuvant with an excellent safety record in humans (part of >20 licensed human vaccines and in use >70 years); 3) Stabilized, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which stimulates immune specificity for COVID-19. Further assessment in humans will determine if BCG:CoVac can impart protective immunity against not only SARS-CoV-2, but also other respiratory infections where BCG has known efficacy.",Claudio Counoupas; Alberto Stella; Nayan Bhattacharyya; Alice Grey; Karishma Patel; Angela Ferguson; Owen Hutchings; Carl Feng; Umaimainthan Palendira; Megan Steain; Anupriya Aggarwal; Jason Low; Joel Mackay; Anthony Kelleher; Warwick Britton; Stuart Turville; James A Triccas,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.419044,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.419044,2020-12-10,2020-12-10,,False

In the search for small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, drug repurposing is being extensively explored. Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801) is an orally bioavailable nucleoside analog that possesses a relatively broad-spectrum antiviral activity including against coronaviruses. We here studied the effect of EIDD-2801 in a well-established Syrian hamster SARS-CoV2 infection model. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with 200 mg/kg BID of EIDD-2801 for four consecutive days, starting from the day of infection, significantly reduced infectious virus titers and viral RNA loads in the lungs and markedly improved lung histopathology. When onset of treatment was delayed until 1 or 2 days after infection, a very modest antiviral effect was observed.

473,Betulonic acid derivatives inhibiting coronavirus replication in cell culture via the nsp15 endoribonuclease,"The lack of medication to suppress coronavirus infections is a main reason for the dramatic course of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to identify suitable coronavirus drug targets and corresponding lead molecules. Here we describe the discovery of a class of coronavirus inhibitors acting on nsp15, a hexameric protein component of the viral replication-transcription complexes, endowed with immune evasion-associated endoribonuclease activity. SAR exploration of these 1,2,3-triazolo fused betulonic acid derivatives yielded lead molecule 5h as a strong inhibitor (antiviral EC50: 0.6 M) of human coronavirus 229E replication. An nsp15 endoribonuclease active site mutant virus was markedly less sensitive to 5h, and selected resistance to the compound mapped to mutations in the N-terminal part of nsp15, at an interface between two nsp15 monomers. The biological findings were substantiated by the nsp15 binding mode for 5h, predicted by docking. Hence, besides delivering a distinct class of inhibitors, our study revealed a druggable pocket in the nsp15 hexamer with relevance for anti-coronavirus drug development.",Besir Krasniqi; Annelies Stevaert; Benjamin Van Loy; Tien Nguyen; Joice Thomas; Julie Vandeput; Dirk Jochmans; Volker Thiel; Ronald Dijkman; Wim Dehaen; Arnout Voet; Lieve Naesens,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.418996,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.418996,2020-12-10,2020-12-10,,False
474,An interactive viral genome evolution network analysis system enabling rapid large-scale molecular tracing of SARS-CoV-2,"Comprehensive analyses of viral genomes can provide a global picture on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and help to predict the oncoming trends of pandemic. This molecular tracing is mainly conducted through extensive phylogenetic network analyses. However, the rapid accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genomes presents an unprecedented data size and complexity that has exceeded the capacity of existing methods in constructing evolution network through virus genotyping. Here we report a Viral genome Evolution Network Analysis System (VENAS), which uses Hamming distances adjusted by the minor allele frequency to construct viral genome evolution network. The resulting network was topologically clustered and divided using community detection algorithm, and potential evolution paths were further inferred with a network disassortativity trimming algorithm. We also employed parallel computing technology to achieve rapid processing and interactive visualization of >10,000 viral genomes, enabling accurate detection and subtyping of the viral mutations through different stages of Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, several core viral mutations can be independently identified and linked to early transmission events in Covid-19 pandemic. As a general platform for comprehensive viral genome analysis, VENAS serves as a useful computational tool in the current and future pandemics.",Yunchao Ling; Ruifang Cao; Jiaqiang Qian; Jiefu Li; Haokui Zhou; Liyun Yuan; Zhen Wang; Guangyong Zheng; Guoping Zhao; Yixue Li; Zefeng Wang; Guoqing Zhang,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.417121,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.417121,2020-12-10,2020-12-10,,False

Here, we report the design and versatile applications of orthogonal CC dimer-forming peptides with a dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range. In vitro stability and specificity was confirmed in mammalian cells by enzyme reconstitution, transcriptional activation using a combination of DNA-binding and a transcriptional activation domain, and cellular-enzyme-activity regulation based on externally-added peptides. In addition to cellular regulation, coiled-coil-mediated reporter reconstitution was used for the detection of cell fusion mediated by the interaction between the spike protein of pandemic SARS-CoV2 and the ACE2 receptor.

476,SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16 activation mechanism and a cryptic pocket with pan-coronavirus antiviral potential,"Coronaviruses have caused multiple epidemics in the past two decades, in addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic that is severely damaging global health and the economy. Coronaviruses employ between twenty and thirty proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? While experimentally-derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over one millisecond of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16s conformational ensemble in order to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models (MSMs), we investigate if Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.

Statement of SignificanceCoronaviruses are a major threat to human health. These viruses employ molecular machines, called proteins, to infect host cells and replicate. Characterizing the structure and dynamics of these proteins could provide a basis for designing small molecule antivirals. In this work, we use computer simulations to understand the moving parts of an essential SARS-CoV-2 protein, understand how a binding partner turns it on and off, and identify a novel pocket that antivirals could target to shut this protein off. The pocket is also present in other coronaviruses but not in the related human protein, so it could be a valuable target for pan-coronavirus antivirals.",Neha Vithani; Michael D Ward; Maxwell I Zimmerman; Borna Novak; Jonathan H.

477,Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by HIV-1 specific broadly neutralizing antibodies and polyclonal plasma,"Cross-reactive epitopes (CREs) are similar epitopes on viruses that are recognized or neutralized by same antibodies. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, similar to type I fusion proteins of viruses such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is heavily glycosylated. Viral Env glycans, though host derived, are distinctly processed and thereby recognized or accommodated during antibody responses. In recent years, highly potent and/or broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that are generated in chronic HIV-1 infections have been defined. These bnAbs exhibit atypical features such as extensive somatic hypermutations, long complementary determining region (CDR) lengths, tyrosine sulfation and presence of insertions/deletions, enabling them to effectively neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses despite extensive variations within the core epitopes they recognize. As some of the HIV-1 bnAbs have evolved to recognize the dense viral glycans and cross-reactive epitopes (CREs), we assessed if these bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Several HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 while one HIV-1 CD4 binding site bnAb, N6, neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, neutralizing plasma antibodies of chronically HIV-1 infected children showed cross neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our observations suggest that human monoclonal antibodies tolerating extensive epitope variability can be leveraged to neutralize pathogens with related antigenic profile.

ImportanceIn the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be a critical feature of recovered patients. HIV-1 bnAbs recognize extensively diverse cross-reactive epitopes and tolerate diversity within their core epitope. Given the unique nature of HIV-1 bnAbs and their ability to recognize and/or accommodate viral glycans, we reasoned that the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be targeted by HIV-1 specific bnAbs. Herein, we showed that HIV-1 specific antibodies cross-react and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Understanding cross-reactive neutralization epitopes of antibodies generated in divergent viral infections will provide key evidence for engineering so called super-antibodies (antibodies that can potently neutralize diverse pathogens with similar antigenic features). Such cross-reactive antibodies can provide a blueprint upon which synthetic variants can be generated in the face of future pandemics.",Nitesh Mishra; Sanjeev Kumar; Swarandeep Singh; Tanu Bansal; Nishkarsh Jain; Sumedha Saluja; Jayanth Kumar Palanichamy; Riyaz A Mir; Subrata Sinha; Kalpana Luthra,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.418806,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.418806,2020-12-10,2020-12-10,,False
478,Conformational diversity of CDR region during affinity maturation determines the affinity and stability of Sars-Cov-1 VHH-72 nanobody,"The affinity maturation of Sars-Cov-1 VHH-72 nanobody from its germline predecessor has been studied at the molecular level. The effect of somatic mutations accumulated during affinity maturation process on flexibility, stability and affinity of the germline and affinity matured nanobody was studied. Affinity maturation results in loss of local flexibility in CDR of H3 and this resulted in a gain of affinity towards the antigen. Further affinity maturation was found to destabilize the nanobody. Mechanistically the loss of flexibility of the CDR H3 is due to the redistribution of hydrogen bond network due to somatic mutation A50T, also this contributes significantly to the destability of the nanobody. Unlike antibody, in nanobody the framework region is highly conserved and structural diversity in CDR is the determining factor in diverse antigen binding and also a factor contributing to the stability. This study provide insights into the interrelationship between flexibility, stability and affinity during affinity maturation in a nanobody.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.416164,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.416164,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,False
479,Pre-existing T cell-mediated cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 cannot solely be explained by prior exposure to endemic human coronaviruses,"Several studies have reported the presence of pre-existing humoral or cell-mediated cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in healthy individuals unexposed to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the current literature suggests that this pre-existing cross-reactivity could, in part, derive from prior exposure to  common cold endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs). In this study, we characterised the sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2-derived T-cell epitopes reported in the literature across the entire diversity of the Coronaviridae family. Slightly over half (54.8%) of the tested epitopes did not have noticeable homology to any of the human endemic coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), suggesting prior exposure to these viruses cannot explain the full cross-reactive profiles observed in healthy unexposed individuals. Further, we find that the proportion of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with noticeable sequence homology is extremely well predicted by the phylogenetic distance to SARS-CoV-2 (R2 = 96.6%). None of the coronaviruses sequenced to date showed a statistically significant excess of T-cell epitope homology relative to the proportion of expected random matches given the sequence similarity of their core genome to SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, our results suggest that the repertoire of cross-reactive epitopes reported in healthy adults cannot be primarily explained by prior exposure to any coronavirus known to date, or any related yet-uncharacterised coronavirus.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.415703,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.415703,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,False

A vaccine providing rapid and persistent protection across populations is urgently needed to prevent disease and transmission. We here describe the development of novel COVID-19 DNA plasmid vaccines encoding homodimers consisting of a targeting unit that binds chemokine receptors on antigen-presenting cells (human MIP-1 /LD78{beta}), a dimerization unit (derived from the hinge and CH3 exons of human IgG3), and an antigenic unit (Spike or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2). The candidate encoding the longest RBD variant (VB2060) demonstrated high secretion of a functional protein and induced rapid and dose-dependent RBD IgG antibody responses that persisted up to at least 3 months after a single dose of the vaccine in mice. Neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against the live virus were detected from day 7 after one dose. All tested dose regimens reached titers that were higher or comparable to those seen in sera from human convalescent COVID-19 patients from day 28. T cell responses were detected already at day 7, and were subsequently characterized to be multifunctional CD8+ and Th1 dominated CD4+ T cells. Responses remained at sustained high levels until at least 3 months after a single vaccination, being further strongly boosted by a second vaccination at day 89. These findings, together with the simplicity and scalability of plasmid DNA manufacturing, safety data on the vaccine platform in clinical trials, low cost of goods, data indicating potential long term storage at +2{degrees} to 8{degrees}C and simple administration, suggests the VB2060 candidate is a promising second generation candidate to prevent COVID-19.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.416875,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.416875,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,False
481,Intra-host variability in global SARS-CoV-2 genomes as signatures of RNA editing: implications in viral and host response outcomes,"Since its zoonotic transmission in the human host, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions and has diversified extensively. A hallmark feature of viral system survival is their continuous evolution and adaptation within the host. RNA editing via APOBEC and ADAR family of enzymes has been recently implicated as the major driver of intra-host variability of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Analysis of the intra-host single-nucleotide variations (iSNVs) in SARS-CoV-2 genomes at spatio-temporal scales can provide insights on the consequence of RNA editing on the establishment, spread and functional outcomes of the virus. In this study, using 1,347 transcriptomes of COVID-19 infected patients across various populations, we find variable prevalence of iSNVs with distinctly higher levels in Indian population. Our results also suggest that iSNVs can likely establish variants in a population. These iSNVs may also contribute to key structural and functional changes in the Spike protein that confer antibody resistance.",Not available,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.417519,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.417519,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,False

Using our proprietary technologies, we have engineered a human antibody that recognizes SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein with an enhanced affinity for mucin to improve the antibodys retention in respiratory mucosa. The modified antibody, when administered into mouse nostrils, was shown to block infection in mice that were exposed to high titer SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus 10 hours after the initial antibody treatment. Our data show that the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection is effective in both nasal and lung areas 7 days after viral exposure. The modified antibody is stable in a nasal spray formulation and maintains its SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity. Nasal spray of the modified antibody can be developed as an affordable and effective prophylactic product to protect people from infection by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus in the air.

483,Characterization of protease activity of Nsp3 from SARS-CoV-2 and its in vitro inhibition by nanobodies,"Of the 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) encoded by SARS CoV-2, Nsp3 is the largest and plays important roles in the viral life cycle. Being a large, multidomain, transmembrane protein, Nsp3 has been the most challenging Nsp to characterize. Encoded within Nsp3 is the papain-like protease PLpro domain that cleaves not only the viral protein but also polyubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 from host cells. We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC50s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme.

We report here that spike is trafficked to lysosomes and that the D614G mutation enhances the lysosomal sorting of spike and the lysosomal accumulation of spike-positive punctae in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Spike trafficking to lysosomes is an endocytosis-independent, V-ATPase-dependent process, and spike-containing lysosomes drive lysosome clustering but display poor lysotracker labeling and reduced uptake of endocytosed materials. These results are consistent with a lysosomal pathway of coronavirus biogenesis and raise the possibility that a common mechanism may underly the D614G mutations effects on spike protein trafficking in infected cells and the accelerated entry of SARS-CoV-2 into uninfected cells.",Chenxu Guo; Shang Jui Tsai; Yiwei Ai; Maggie Li; Andrew Pekosz; Andrea Cox; Nadia Atai; Stephen Gould,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.417022,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.417022,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,False
485,Theoretical Epidemic Laws Based on Data of COVID-19 Pandemic,"The standard growth model of epidemic evolution such as the Richards generalized logistic function is remarkably successful because it agrees with almost all previous epidemic data. Yet, it fails to explain intervention measures for mitigations of the ongoing coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It also fails to replicate an endemic phase that occurs in many countries epidemic curves (time series data of daily new cases). These discrepancies demonstrate that new epidemic laws are required to understand, predict and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we show that almost all COVID-19 evolution can be modeled by three innovative epidemic laws. Specifically, based on the world COVID-19 data, we first divide an epidemic curve into three phases: an exponential growth phase, an exponential decay phase, and a constant endemic phase. We next integrate the growth and the decay phases into the first epidemic law with interventions as a model parameter. This law is completely opposite to the Richards generalized logistic function in terms of intervention measures. We then combine the first epidemic law with the endemic phase to form the second epidemic law, which makes the curve of cumulative cases increase linearly as time tends to infinity. The third epidemic law states if an epidemic is composed of multiple epidemic waves, the superposition principle applies. These laws were confirmed by the COVID-19 data from 18 countries including undeveloped, developing and developed countries. Finally, we pave the way for future research to incorporate the proposed theory into the classic SIR model. We anticipate that the results from this research can provide a scientific base for governments to mitigate the COVID-19 and other epidemic disasters.",Junke Guo,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20238253,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20238253,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,True
486,"Smoking, distress and COVID-19 in England: cross-sectional population surveys from 2016 to 2020","BackgroundChanges in the prevalence of mental health problems among smokers due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England have important implications for existing health inequalities. This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers following the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years.

MethodsCross-sectional data were used from a representative survey of smokers (18+) in England (n = 2,927) during four months (April to July) in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Adjusted logistic regressions estimated the associations between past-month psychological distress across two time periods (2016/17 and 2020), and age. Weighted proportions, chi-squared statistics and stratified logistic regression models were used to compare the distributions of minimal, moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-demographic and smoking characteristic categories in 2016/17 and 2020.

ResultsThe prevalence of moderate and severe distress among past-year smokers was higher in 2020 (moderate: 28.79%, 95%CI 26.11-31.60; OR=2.08, 95%CI 1.34-3.25; severe: 11.04%, 9.30-13.12; OR=2.16, 1.13-4.07) than in 2016/17 (moderate: 20.66%, 19.02-22.43; severe: 8.23%, 7.16-9.47). While there was no overall evidence of an interaction between time period and age, young (16-24 years) and middle-age groups (45-54 years) may have experienced greater increases in moderate and older age groups (65+ years) in severe distress from 2016/17 to 2020. There were also increases in 2020 of moderate distress among those from more disadvantaged social grades and of both moderate and severe distress among women and those with low cigarette addiction.

ConclusionsBetween April-July 2016/17 and April-July 2020 in England there were increases in both moderate and severe distress among smokers. The distribution of distress differed between 2016/17 and 2020 and represents a widening of established inequalities, with increases in distress among socio-economically disadvantaged groups, women and diverging age groups.

487,Stress-related emotional and behavioural impact following the first COVID-19 outbreak peak,"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses multiple psychologically-stressful challenges and is associated with increased risk for mental illness. Previous studies have mostly focused on the psychopathological symptoms associated with the outbreak peak.

MethodsWe examined the behavioural and mental health impact of the pandemic in Israel using an online survey. We collected 12,125 responses from 4,933 adult respondents during six weeks encompassing the end of the first outbreak and the beginning of the second. We used clinically validated instruments (Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18), Perceived stress scale (PSS), Brief COPE inventory) to assess anxiety- and depression-related emotional distress, symptoms, and coping strategies, as well as questions designed to specifically assess COVID-19-related concerns.

ResultsRespondents indicated worrying more about the situation in their country and their close ones contracting the virus, than about their own health and financial situation. The reported distress correlates with the number of new COVID-19 cases and higher emotional burden was associated with being female, younger, unemployed, living in low socioeconomic status localities, encountering more people, and experiencing physiological symptoms. Unexpectedly, older age and having a prior medical condition were associated with reduced emotional distress.

ConclusionsOur findings show that inequalities in mental-health burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are relevant also following the initial outbreak, and highlight the environmental context and its importance in understanding individual ability to cope with the long-term stressful challenges of the pandemic.",Asaf Benjamin; Yael Kuperman; Noa Eren; Maya Amitai; Hagai Rossman; Smadar Shilo; Tomer Meir; Ayya Keshet; Orit Nuttman-Shwartz; Eran Segal; Alon Chen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20245787,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20245787,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,True
488,Characterising long-term covid-19: a rapid living systematic review,"ObjectiveTo understand the frequency, profile, and duration of persistent symptoms of covid-19 and to update this understanding as new evidence emerges.

DesignA living systematic review produced in response to the rapidly evolving evidence base for  long covid.

Data sourcesMedline and CINAHL (EBSCO), Global Health (Ovid), WHO Global Research Database on covid-19, LitCOVID, and Google Scholar to 28th September 2020.

Study selectionStudies reporting long-term symptoms and complications among people with confirmed or suspected covid-19, both in those previously hospitalised and those never hospitalised. Only studies incorporating over 100 participants qualified for data extraction and were assessed for risk of bias. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics.

Quality assessmentRisk of bias was assessed using a quality assessment checklist for prevalence studies.

ResultsTwenty-eight studies qualified for data extraction; 16 of these were cohort studies, ten cross-sectional, and two large case series. The analysis included 9,442 adults with covid-19 from 13 countries. The longest mean follow-up period was 111 (SD: 11) days post-hospital discharge. A wide range of systemic, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, and psychosocial symptoms was reported, of which the most common were breathlessness, fatigue, smell and taste disturbance, and anxiety. Persistent symptoms were described across both previously hospitalised and non-hospitalised populations. The quality of evidence was low, with a high risk of bias and heterogeneity in prevalence. The incorporated studies demonstrated limited external validity, a lack of control subjects, and inconsistent data collection methods. Few studies were conducted in primary care, no studies focused solely on children, and no studies were set in low- and middle-income countries.

ConclusionOur findings suggest that  long covid is a complex, heterogeneous condition; however, the limited evidence base currently precludes a precise definition of its symptoms and prevalence. There is a clear need for robust, controlled, prospective cohort studies, including different at-risk populations and settings, incorporating appropriate investigations, collected and recorded in a standardised way.

Systematic review registrationThe protocol was prospectively registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42020211131).

Readers noteThis living systematic review will be updated regularly as new evidence emerges. The search terms and inclusion criteria will be updated in line with new evidence, research priorities and policy needs. This version is the original publication. Updates may occur for up to two years from the date of original publication. When citing this paper please consider adding the version number and date of access for clarity.

489,Health Signatures During COVID-19: A Precision Fitness Case Study,"BACKGROUNDStay-at-home orders have proven a controversial, while effective, method of SARS-CoV-2 containment. However objective measures of how the pandemic and stay-at-home orders are affecting the daily health of uninfected individuals have been lacking.

METHODSWe investigated the effect of pandemic-related events on 61 individuals in San Antonio, Texas whose daily activity and sleep data were recorded via wearable activity trackers from April 2019 to August 2020. We assessed changes in six fitness metrics (steps walked, resting heart rate, sedentary minutes, wake duration after sleep onset, rapid eye movement (REM) duration, total sleep duration). Cluster analysis and time-course analysis identified trends in activity before, after and during stay-at-home orders. Quantitative measures of activities were compared to survey responses.

RESULTSFour behavior patterns during stay-at-home orders were identified. Most individuals suffered declines in healthy habits compared to their daily activity in 2019 and early 2020 (e.g., up to -60% steps walked). Inflection points corresponded with key dates relevant to SARS-CoV-2 including the first reported case in the U.S. (Feb 29) and city-wide stay-at-home orders (Mar 23). Pre-existing conditions (diabetes, asthma) were associated with a steeper than average decline in sleep quality during stay-at-home orders. Unexpectedly, we also identified a group of predominately male individuals who improved their daily fitness during stay-at-home orders.

CONCLUSIONSObjective measures of daily activity indicated most individuals fitness suffered at the onset of stay-at-home orders and slowly returned towards baseline. For a subset of individuals, fitness quantitatively improved - better sleep, more exercise, lower resting heart rate - during stay-at-home orders.",Erin P Pollet; Aishwarya Sathish; Zacharie Maloney; Byron L Long; Jennifer Brethen; Amina Ann Qutub,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20245001,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20245001,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,True
490,SARS Coronavirus-2 microneutralisation and commercial serological assays correlated closely for some but not all enzyme immunoassays,"BackgroundSerological testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies provides important research and diagnostic information relating to COVID-19 prevalence, incidence, and host immune response. A greater understanding of the relationship between functionally neutralising antibodies detected using microneutralisation assays and binding antibodies detected using scalable enzyme immunoassays (EIA) is needed in order to address protective immunity post-infection or vaccination, and assess EIA suitability as a surrogate test for screening of convalescent plasma donors. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with signal cut-off ratios in five commercially available EIAs, and one in-house assay based on expressed spike protein targets.

MethodsSera from individuals recovered from patients or convalescent plasma donors who reported laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=200), and negative control sera collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (n=100) were assessed in parallel. Performance was assessed by calculating EIA sensitivity and specificity with reference to microneutralisation.

ResultsNeutralising antibodies were detected in 166 (83%) samples. Compared with this, the most sensitive EIAs were the Cobas Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (98%) and Vitros Immunodiagnostic Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%), which detect total antibody targeting the N and S1 antigens, respectively. The assay with the best quantitative relationship with microneutralisation was the Euroimmun IgG.

ConclusionsThese results suggest the marker used (total Ab vs IgG vs IgA), and the target antigen are important determinants of assay performance. The strong correlation between microneutralisation and some commercially available assays demonstrate their potential for clinical and research use in assessing protection following infection or vaccination, and use as a surrogate test to assess donor suitability for convalescent plasma donation.",Gregory J Walker; Zin Naing; Alberto Ospina Stella; Malinna Yeang; Joanna Caguicla; Vidiya Ramachandran; Sonia R Isaacs; David Agapiou; Rowena Bull; Sacha Stelzer-Braid; James Daly; Iain B Gosbell; Veronica C Hoad; David O Irving; Joanne M Pink; Stuart Turville; Anthony D Kelleher; William D Rawlinson,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20245696,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20245696,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,True
491,Six-month antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers assessed by virus neutralisation and commercial assays,"We conducted a prospective study in healthcare workers (n=296) of the University Hospital of Lyon, France. Serum samples (n=296) collected six months after disease onset were tested using three commercial assays: the Wantai Ab assay detecting total antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, the bioMerieux Vidas assay detecting IgG to the RBD and the Abbott Architect assay detecting IgG to the N protein. The neutralising antibody (NAb) titre was also determined for all samples with a virus neutralisation assay (VNA) using live virus. The positivity rate was 100% with the Wantai assay, 84.8% with the bioMerieux assay and 55.4% with the Abbott assay. Only 51% of HCWs were positive for the presence of NAb. Less than 10 % of HCWs had a NAb titre greater than 80. At a neutralising titre of 80, the area under the curves [IC 95%] was 0.71 [0.62-0.81], 0.75 [0.65-0.85] and 0.95 [0.92-0.97] for Wantai, Abbott and Vidas respectively. The data presented herein suggest that commercial assays detecting antibodies against the N protein must not be used in long-term seroprevalence surveys while the Wantai assay could be useful for this purpose. VNA should remain the gold standard to assess the protective antibody response, but some commercial assays could be used as first-line screening of long-term presence of NAb.",Antonin Bal; Mary-Anne Trabaud; Jean-Baptiste Fassier; Muriel Rabilloud; Kahina Saker; Carole Langlois; Nicolas Guibert; Constance d'Aubarede; Adele Paul; Dulce Alfaiate; Amelie Massardier; Virginie Pitiot; Florence Morfin; Bruno Lina; Bruno Pozzetto; Sophie Trouillet-Assant,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20245811,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20245811,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,True
492,"SARS-CoV-2 infections in kindergartens and associated households at the start of the second wave in Berlin, Germany - a cross sectional study","ObjectivesThe comparatively large proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the youngest children opens up the possibility that kindergartens represent reservoirs of infection. However, actual surveys in kindergartens beyond individual outbreaks are rare. At the beginning of the second pandemic wave in Berlin, Germany, i.e., end of September 2020, we screened SARS-CoV-2 infections among kindergarten children, staff and connected household members.

MethodsTwelve kindergartens were randomly selected in the Berlin metropolitan area, and a total of 720 participants were recruited (155 pre-school children, 78 staff, 487 household members). Participants were briefly examined and interviewed, and SARS-CoV-2 infections and anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG antibodies were assessed.

ResultsSigns and symptoms, largely resembling common cold, were present in 24.2% of children and 28.9% of staff. However, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected among 701 PCR-tested individuals, and only one childcare worker showed IgG seroreactivity (0.15%; 1/672).

ConclusionsAgainst a backdrop of increased pandemic activity in the community, this cross-sectional study does not suggest that kindergartens are silent transmission reservoirs. Nevertheless, at increasing pandemic activity, reinforced precautionary measures and repeated routine testing appears advisable.",Marlene Thielecke; Stefanie Theuring; Welmoed van Loon; Franziska Hommes; Marcus A.

493,"A novel multi-omics-based identification of symptoms, comorbid conditions, and possible long-term complications in COVID-19","Till date the comprehensive clinical pictures, comorbid conditions, and long-term complications of COVID-19 are not known. Recently using a multi-omics-based strategy, we have predicted the drugs for COVID-19 management with [~]70% accuracy. Here, using a similar multi-omics-based bioinformatics approach and three-ways of analysis, we identified the symptoms, comorbid conditions, and short, mid and possible long-term complications of COVID-19 with [~]90% precision. In our analysis (i) we identified 27 parent, 170 child, and 403 specific conditions associated with COVID-19. (ii) Among the specific conditions, 36 are viral and 53 short-term, 62 short to mid to long-term, 194 mid to long-term, and 57 are congenital conditions. (iii) At a cut off ""count of occurrence"" of 4, we found [~] 90% of the enriched conditions are associated with COVID-19. (iv) Except the dry cough and loss of taste, all other COVID-19 associated mild and severe symptoms are enriched. (v) Cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, kidney, liver, and immune system disorders are found as top comorbid conditions. (vi) Specific diseases such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, COPD, lung injury, diabetes, cirrhosis, mood disorders, dementia, macular degeneration, chronic kidney disease, lupus, arthritis etc. along with several other diseases are also enriched as top candidates. (vii) Interestingly, many cancers and congenital disorders associated with COVID-19 severity are also identified. (viii) Arthritis, dermatomyositis, glioma, diabetes, psychiatric disorder, cardiovascular diseases having bidirectional relationship with COVID-19 are also found as top ranked conditions. Based on the accuracy ([~]90%) of this analysis, long presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human, and our previously proposed ""genetic remittance"" assumption, we hypothesize that all the identified comorbid conditions including the short-long-mid and mid-long non-communicable diseases (NCDs) could also be long-term consequences in COVID-19 survivors and warrants long-term observational studies.",Debmalya Barh; Sandeep Tiwari; Bruno Silva Andrade; Marianna E.

494,"The Impacts of Testing Cadence, Mode of Instruction, and Student Density on Fall 2020 COVID-19 Rates On Campus","We analyzed the COVID-19 infection rate among undergraduate students at 9 colleges and Universities in the greater Boston area and 4 comparison schools elsewhere, from Fall 2020. We assessed whether the cumulative rate of infection is dependent on the mode of instruction (in-person, hybrid, or remote), on the number and density of dorm-resident undergraduates, and/or on COVID-19 testing cadence. We limited our analysis to institutions that have implemented at least weekly PCR testing of dormitory-resident undergraduates. Our primary conclusions are that (i) the fraction of students that succumbed to a COVID-19 infection up through Nov 22, 2020 shows no correlation with either the total number of students on campus, or the fractional occupancy of dormitories, (ii) remote instruction vs. hybrid instruction has no significant measurable impact on cumulative infection rate, and (iii) there is evidence that testing 2 or 3 times per week is correlated with lower infection rates than weekly testing. These data are consistent with a hypothesis of students predominantly acquiring infection off-campus, with little community transmission within dormitory housing. This implies good student compliance with face mask and social distancing protocols.

Significance StatementWe review the incidence of COVID-19 infection among under-graduate students for selected colleges and universities that conducted at least weekly COVID-19 testing during the Fall of 2020. We analyzed the infection-rate dependence on number of students on campus, dormitory residential density, instructional methodology (remote vs. hybrid), and testing cadence.

495,Neighbourhood-level Racial/Ethnic and Economic Inequities in COVID-19 Burden Within Urban Areas in the US and Canada,"The COVID-19 pandemic exhibits stark social inequities in infection and mortality outcomes. We investigated neighborhood-level inequities across cities in the US and Canada for COVID-19 cumulative case rates (46 cities), death rates (12 cities), testing rates and test positivity (12 cities), using measures that characterize social gradients by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic composition, or both jointly. We found consistent evidence of social gradients for case, death and positivity rates, with the most privileged neighborhoods having the lowest rates, but no meaningful variation in the magnitude of inequities between cities. Gradients were not apparent in testing rates, suggesting inadequate testing in the most deprived neighborhoods. Health agencies should monitor and compare inequities as part of their COVID-19 reporting practices and to guide pandemic response efforts.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIWithin urban regions with available data in the US and Canada, there were strong social gradients for case, death and positivity rates
C_LIO_LIThe most racially and/or economically privileged neighborhoods had the lowest rates
C_LIO_LISocial gradients were similar for neighborhood-level measures of racial/ethnic composition, income, racialized economic segregation, and racialized occupational segregation

496,A Selective Increase in OC Symptoms is Driving Information Seeking and Guideline Adherence During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"BackgroundIncreased mental health problems as a reaction to stressful life events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, are common. Critically, successful adaptation helps reduce such symptoms to baseline, preventing long-term psychiatric disorders. It is thus important to understand whether and which psychiatric symptoms only show transient elevations, and which persist long-term and become chronically heightened. At particular risk for the latter trajectory are disorders with symptoms directly affected by the pandemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.

MethodsIn this longitudinal large-scale study (N=416), we assessed how obsessive-compulsive (OC), anxiety, and depression symptoms changed throughout the course of the first pandemic wave in a sample of the general UK public. We further examined how these symptoms affected pandemic-related information seeking and adherence to governmental guidelines.

FindingsAll psychiatric domains were initially elevated, but showed distinct adaptation patterns. Depression scores decreased during the first pandemic wave, however, OC symptoms further increased, even after the end of lockdown. These OC symptoms were directly linked to Covid-related information seeking which gave rise to higher adherence to government guidelines.

InterpretationThe rise and persistence of OC symptoms, despite the ease of Covid-19 restrictions, shows that OCD is disproportionally and chronically affected by the pandemic. This is particularly worrying with regards to the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on public mental health and indicates that patients with OCD may require particular treatment efforts.",Alisa Maria Loosen; Vasilisa Skvortsova; Tobias U.

497,Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study,"ObjectivesIn addition to risking their physical well-being, frontline physicians are enduring significant emotional burden both at work and home during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to identify associated factors among Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Methods and designA cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted between April 21 and May 10, 2020. Outcomes assessed included demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

ResultsThe survey was completed by 412 Bangladeshi physicians. The findings revealed that, in terms of standardized HADS cut-off points, the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians was 67.72% and 48.5% respectively. Risk factors for higher rates of anxiety or depressive symptoms were: being female, physicians who had experienced COVID-19 like symptoms during the pandemic, those who had not received incentives, those who used self-funded PPE, not received adequate training, lacking perceived self-efficacy to manage COVID -19 positive patients, greater perceived stress of being infected, fear of getting assaulted/humiliated, being more connected with social media, having lower income levels to support the family, feeling more agitated, less than 2 hours of leisure activity per day and short sleep duration. All these factors were found to be positively associated with anxiety and depression in unadjusted and adjusted statistical models.

ConclusionsThis study identifies a real concern about the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among Bangladeshi physicians and identifies several associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the vulnerability of the physicians in this extraordinary period whilst they are putting their own lives at risk to help people infected by COVID-19, health authorities should address the psychological needs of medical staff and formulate effective strategies to support vital frontline health workers.

STHRENGHTS & LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDYO_LIThis study reports a novel and concerning findings on the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms with identification of several important associated factors among Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.
C_LIO_LIThe cross-sectional nature of the study design could not establish causal relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
C_LIO_LIThis study was carried out by conducting a web-based survey, which might generate sampling bias by excluding the physicians who do not have access to internet or inactive in social medias, and thus limit the generalizability of the findings.

498,Efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation in severe and critical-ill COVID-19 patients: a controlled study,"Severe and critical ill COVID-19 patients frequently need acute care hospitalization including mechanical ventilation at ICU due to acute respiratory distress. A high proportion of these patients will develop ICU-acquired weakness and a need for rehabilitation. However data on rehabilitation outcomes in these patients are scarce and the efficacy of rehabilitation remains essentially unclear. We therefore compared the rehabilitation outcomes between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and other patients with common pneumonia to assess their rehabilitation efficacies.

We retrospectively compared the performances of six-min walk test (6MWT), chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ), and functional independence measure (FIM) at the discharge from pulmonary rehabilitation between 51 Covid-19 patients and 51 patients with common pneumonia using linear regression controlled for baseline values at entrance, age, sex and cumulative Illness rating scale. Fisher exact test was applied to test whether the odd ratios (ORs) of non-improvement/improvement in 6MWT (>30-m) and CRQ (>10-point) at discharge were different between the two groups.

Covid-19 patients had similar performances at discharge in 6MWT (P-value=0.14), CRQ (P-value=0.55), and 4.2-point higher (P-value=0.004) in FIM compared to the control group. No differences in the outcomes were found between severe and critical COVID-19 patients. The OR of non-improvement/improvement in 6MWT was 0.30 (P-value=0.13) between COVID-19 and control groups; but the odd of non-improvement in CRQ tended to be 3.02 times higher (P-value =0.075) in COVID-19 group.

In-house rehabilitation is effective and suitable for COVID-19 patients irrespective from disease severity. The discrepancy of high physical improvement and relatively low gains of disease related quality of life compared to control patients with common pneumonia is however remarkable. Further studies need to evaluate whether this discrepancy is an indicator of chronic disease development.",Gilbert Buesching; Zhongxing Zhang; Jean Paul Schmid; Thomas Sigrist; Ramin Khatami,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20245936,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20245936,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,True

Our aim was to assess the role of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19.

MethodsA single-center, prospective, observational, sequential cohort study was performed among consecutive adults hospitalized with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 between March- July,2020. Patients were screened for inclusion by a priori criteria, and were included in the favipiravir cohort if SOC+FVP, or the non-favipiravir group if SOC{+/-}other antiviral medications without FVP were administered for >48 hours. Treatment allocation was done per national guidelines. For COVID-19 diagnosis and severity, ECDC and WHO definitions were utilized, and daily per protocol hospital follow-up was done. Primary composite end-point was disease progression (14-day all-cause death, need for mechanical ventilation, or immunomodulatory therapy). For statistical comparison, Fishers exact test and Mann- Whitney U-test were used.

ResultsIn all, 75 patients were included per cohort. In the FVP cohort, chronic heart disease (36/75, 48.0% vs. 16/75, 21.3%, p<0.01) and diabetes mellitus (23/75, 30.7% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p<0.01) were more prevalent, hospital LOS (18.5{+/-}15.5 days vs. 13.0{+/-}8.5 days, p<0.01) was higher. Disease progression (17/75, 22.7% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p=0.13), 14-day all-cause death (9/75, 12.0% vs. 10/75, 13.3%, p=0.8) and need for mechanical ventillation (8/75, 10.7% vs. 4/75, 5.3%, p=0.22) were similar between groups. Immunomodulatory therapies were administered frequently among patients receiving FVP (10/75, 13.3% vs. 1/75, 1.3%, p<0.01).

500,Positive correlation between long term emission of several air pollutants and COVID-19 deaths in Sweden,"Several recent studies have found troubling links between air pollution and both incidence and mortality of COVID-19, the pandemic disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigate whether such a link can be found also in Sweden, a country with low population density and a relatively good air quality in general, with low background levels of important pollutants such as PM2.5 and NO2. The investigation is carried out by relating normalized emission levels of several air pollutants to normalized COVID-19 deaths at the municipality level, after applying a sieve function using an empirically determined threshold value to filter out noise. We find a fairly strong correlation for PM2.5, PM10 and SO2, and a moderate one for NOx. We find no correlation neither for CO, nor (as expected) for CO2. Our results are statistically significant and the calculations are simple and easily verifiable. Since the study considers only emission levels of air pollutants and not measurements of air quality, climatic and meteorological factors (such as average wind speeds) can trivially be ruled out as confounders. Finally, we also show that although there are small positive correlations between population density and COVID-19 deaths in the studied municipalities (which are for the most part rural and non densely populated) they are either weak or not statistically significant.",Lars Helander,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.20244418,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.20244418,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,True
501,Comprehensive analysis of T cell immunodominance and immunoprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in COVID-19 cases,"T cells are involved in control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To establish the patterns of immunodominance of different SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and precisely measure virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we studied epitope-specific T cell responses of approximately 100 convalescent COVID-19 cases. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome was probed using 1,925 peptides spanning the entire genome, ensuring an unbiased coverage of HLA alleles for class II responses. For HLA class I, we studied an additional 5,600 predicted binding epitopes for 28 prominent HLA class I alleles, accounting for wide global coverage. We identified several hundred HLA-restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes. Distinct patterns of immunodominance were observed, which differed for CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and antibodies. The class I and class II epitopes were combined into new epitope megapools to facilitate identification and quantification of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.",Alison Tarke; John Sidney; Conner K Kidd; Jennifer M Dan; Sydney I Ramirez; Esther Dawen Yu; Jose Mateus; Ricardo da Silva Antunes; Erin Moore; Paul Rubiro; Nils Methot; Elizabeth J Phillips; Simon Mallal; April Frazier; Stephen Rawlings; Jason A Greenbaum; Bjoern Peters; Davey M Smith; Shane Crotty; Daniela Weiskopf; Alba Grifoni; Alessandro Sette,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.416750,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.416750,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,False
502,Persistent Cellular Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for an ongoing pandemic that affected millions of individuals around the globe. To gain further understanding of the immune response in recovered individuals we measured T cell responses in paired samples obtained an average of 1.3 and 6.1 months after infection from 41 individuals. The data indicate that recovered individuals show persistent polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific memory that could contribute to rapid recall responses. In addition, recovered individuals show enduring immune alterations in relative numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, expression of activation/exhaustion markers, and cell division.

SummaryWe show that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits broadly reactive and highly functional memory T cell responses that persist 6 months after infection. In addition, recovered individuals show enduring immune alterations in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compartments.",Gaelle Breton; Pilar Mendoza; Thomas Hagglof; Thiago Y.

503,Complete Protection of Nasal and Lung Airways Against SARS-CoV-2 Challenge by Antibody Plus Th1 Dominant N- and S-Specific T-Cell Responses to Subcutaneous Prime and Thermally-Stable Oral Boost Bivalent hAd5 Vaccination in an NHP Study,"BackgroundTo address the dire need for a safe and effective vaccine to protect individuals from and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we developed a COVID-19 vaccine that elicits not only robust humoral responses but also activates T cells. Our bivalent vaccine expresses both an optimized viral spike (S) protein (S-Fusion) and the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein with an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain (N-ETSD) that directs N to the endo/lysosomal subcellular compartment to enhance MHC class II responses. The vaccine antigens are delivered by the second-generation adenovirus serotype 5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-] platform (hAd5) that has been safely administered and found to be effective in generating tumor-specific T cells even in the presence of pre-existing adenovirus immunity. Here, we report our findings on the safety and efficacy of our hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD subcutaneous (SC) prime and thermally-stable oral boost vaccine in generating SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, eliciting N- and S-specific T-cell responses, and providing complete protection with the clearing of virus after challenge in Non-Human Primates (NHP). A key objective of the study was to explore the efficacy of a novel thermally-stable oral hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD to serve as a booster dose following an SC prime.

MethodsGroup 1 NHP received the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine on Days 0 and 14 by SC injection (1011 VP), and on Day 28 by a single oral boost (1010 VP); Group 2 received vaccination on the same schedule, but with an SC prime and two oral boosts. Group 3 placebo NHP were dosed with vehicle-only SC-oral-oral. Blood for the isolation of sera and PBMCs was collected throughout the study. ELISA was used for determination of anti-S IgG levels, cPass for presence of neutralizing antibodies, and ELISpot for interferon-{gamma}(IFN-{gamma}) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) secretion by T cells.

On Study Day 56, all NHP were challenged with intratracheal/intranasal 1 x 106 TCID50/mL SARS-CoV-2. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected on Day 42 pre-challenge and at several time points post-challenge; nasal swabs were collected daily post-challenge. NHP were euthanized on Study Day 70 and tissue collected for histopathological analyses. Viral load and active viral replication were determined in BAL and nasal swab specimens by RT qPCR of genomic and subgenomic RNA, respectively. Safety was determined by cage-side observations such as weight as well as hematology and clinical chemistry analyses of blood.

ResultsThe hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine, both SC and oral, elicited no apparent toxicity seen in clinical chemistry, hematology, or cage-side observations. Neutralizing antibodies were induced in 9 of 10 vaccinated NHP and anti-S IgG positive titers in 10 out of 10. Th1 dominant T-cell responses were elicited by both S and N antigens, with responses being greater for N. Viral replication was inhibited from Day 1 post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge with complete protection in all (10/10) primates within 7 days of challenge from both nasal passages and lung. Replicating SARS-CoV-2 dropped immediately and was undetectable as soon 3 days post-challenge. There was a rapid decline in lymphocytes from the periphery on Day 1 post-challenge and a rebound within 3 days following challenge that was significantly higher by Day 14 post-challenge in Group 1 as compared to Group 3 placebo NHP.

ConclusionsIn the rhesus macaque NHP model, the bivalent hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD subcutaneous and oral vaccine provided complete protection of nasal passages and lung against SARS-CoV-2 challenge by eliciting neutralizing antibodies plus Th1 dominant N- and S-specific T-cell responses. Inhibition of viral replication within the first 24 hours post-challenge, in vaccinated NHP compared to placebo NHP, suggests the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T cells that rapidly cleared infected cells. The rapidity of clearance implies that shedding of live viruses may be attenuated as a result of vaccination and thus the vaccine has the potential to prevent transmission of virus by infected individuals. Clinical trials of hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD are ongoing. The hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD subcutaneous prime/boost vaccine has completed Phase 1 clinical trials and Phase 2/3 trials are actively recruiting. The thermally-stable oral vaccine will enter Phase 1 trials as a prime and boost, as well as explored to provide a boost to subcutaneous vaccination.",Elizabeth Gabitzsch; Jeffrey T Safrit; Mohit Verma; Adrian Rice; Peter Sieling; Lise Zakin; Annie Shin; Brett Morimoto; Helty Adisetiyo; Raymond Wong; Ashish Bezawada; Kyle Dinkins; Joseph Balint; Victor Peykov; Hermes Garban; Philip Liu; Andrew Bacon; Jeff Drew; Patricia Spilman; Lennie Sender; Shahrooz Rabizadeh; Kayvan Niazi; Patrick Soon-Shiong,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.416297,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.416297,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,False
504,Identification of a Novel Susceptibility Marker for SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Subjects and Risk Mitigation with a Clinically Approved JAK Inhibitor in Human/Mouse Cells,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected over 65 million individuals and killed over 1.5 million persons (December 8, 2020; www.who.int)1. While fatality rates are higher among the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities2, host factors that promote susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease are poorly understood. Although individuals with certain autoimmune/inflammatory disorders show increased susceptibility to viral infections, there is incomplete knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in these diseases.3-7 We report that the autoimmune PTPN2 risk variant rs1893217 promotes expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and increases cellular entry mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Elevated ACE2 expression and viral entry were mediated by increased JAK-STAT signalling, and were reversed by the JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel risk biomarker for increased expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and viral entry, and identify a clinically approved therapeutic agent to mitigate this risk.",Marianne R Spalinger; Rong Hai; Jiang Li; Alina N Santos; Tara M Nordgren; Michel L Tremblay; Lars Eckmann; Elaine Hanson; Michael Scharl; Xiwei Wu; Brigid S Boland; Declan F McCole,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.416586,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.09.416586,2020-12-09,2020-12-09,,False
505,Particle-Based COVID-19 Simulator with Contact Tracing and Testing,"GoalCOVID-19 pandemic has emerged as the most severe public health crisis in over a century. As of December 2020, there are more than 60 million cases and 1.4 million deaths. For informed decision making, reliable statistical data and capable simulation tools are needed. Our goal is to develop an epidemic simulator which can model the effects of random population testing and contact tracing.

MethodsOur simulator models each individuals as particles with position, velocity and epidemic status states on a 2D map and runs a SEIR epidemic model with contact tracing and testing modules. The simulator is available in GitHub under MIT license.

ResultsThe results show that the synergistic use of contact tracing and massive testing is effective in suppressing the epidemic (the number of deaths was reduced by 72%).

ConclusionsParticle-based COVID-19 simulator enables the modeling of intervention measures, random testing and contact tracing, for epidemic mitigation and suppression.

506,A 6-mRNA host response whole-blood classifier trained using patients with non-COVID-19 viral infections accurately predicts severity of COVID-19,"BackgroundWhile major progress has been made to establish diagnostic tools for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, determining the severity of COVID-19 remains an unmet medical need. There is a limited availability of hospital resources in this or any pandemic, and appropriately gauging severity would allow for some patients to safely recover in home quarantine, while ensuring that sicker patients get needed care.

MethodsWe here developed a blood-based generalizable host-gene-expression-based classifier for the severity of viral infections and validated it in multiple viral infection settings including COVID-19. We used training data (N=705) from 21 retrospective transcriptomic clinical studies of influenza and other viral illnesses looking at a preselected panel of host immune mRNAs.

ResultsWe selected 6 host mRNAs and trained a logistic regression classifier with a training cross-validation AUROC of 0.90 for predicting 30-day mortality in viral illnesses. Next, in 1,417 samples across 21 independent retrospective validation cohorts the locked 6-mRNA classifier had an AUROC of 0.91 for discriminating patients with severe vs. non-severe infection. Next, in an independent cohort of prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed COVID-19 (N=97) in Athens, Greece, the 6-mRNA locked classifier had an AUROC of 0.89 for identifying patients with severe respiratory failure or 30-day mortality. Finally, we developed an isothermal qRT-LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal gene expression) assay for the 6-mRNA panel to facilitate implementation as a rapid assay.

ConclusionsWith further study, the classifier could assist in the risk assessment of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 to determine severity and level of care, thereby improving patient management and healthcare burden.",Ljubomir Buturovic; Hong Zheng; Benjamin Tang; Kevin Lai; Win Sen Kuan; Mark Gillett; Rahul Santram; Maryam Shojaei; Raquel Almansa; Jose Angel Nieto; Sonsoles Munoz; Carmen Herrero; Nikolaos Antonakos; Panayiotis Koufargyris; Marina Kontogiorgi; Georgia Damoraki; Oliver Liesenfeld; James Wacker; Uros Midic; Roland Luethy; David Rawling; Melissa Remmel; Sabrina Coyle; Yiran Liu; Aditya M Rao; Denis Dermadi; Jiaying Toh; Lara Murphy Jones; Michele Donato; Purvesh Khatri; Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis; Timothy E Sweeney,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20230235,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20230235,2020-12-08,2020-12-08,,True
507,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays for antibody monitoring in natural infection and vaccine trials,"Determinants of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the development of well-standardized, reproducible antibody assays to be utilized in concert with clinical trials to establish correlates of risk and protection. This need has led to the appearance of a variety of neutralization assays used by different laboratories and companies. Using plasma samples from COVID-19 convalescent individuals with mild-to-moderate disease from a localized outbreak in a single region of the western US, we compared three platforms for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization: assay with live SARS-CoV-2, pseudovirus assay utilizing lentiviral (LV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) packaging, and a surrogate ELISA test. Vero, Vero E6, HEK293T cells expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and TZM-bl cells expressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were evaluated. Live-virus and LV-pseudovirus assay with HEK293T cells showed similar geometric mean titers (GMTs) ranging 141-178, but VSV-pseudovirus assay yielded significantly higher GMT (310 95%CI 211-454; p < 0.001). Fifty percent neutralizing dilution (ND50) titers from live-virus and all pseudovirus assay readouts were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.81-0.89). ND50 titers positively correlated with plasma concentration of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) (r = 0.63-0.89), but moderately correlated with nucleoprotein IgG (r = 0.46-0.73). There was a moderate positive correlation between age and spike (Spearmans rho=0.37, p=0.02), RBD (rho=0.39, p=0.013) and nucleoprotein IgG (rho=0.45, p=0.003). ND80 showed stronger correlation with age than ND50 (ND80 rho=0.51 (p=0.001), ND50 rho=0.28 (p=0.075)).

508,Excess deaths associated with the Iranian COVID-19 epidemic: a province-level analysis,"BackgroundThe number of publicly reported deaths from COVID-19 may underestimate the true death toll from the epidemic as they rely on provisional data that are often incomplete or omit undocumented deaths from COVID-19. In addition, these reports may be subject to significant under-reporting due to a limited testing capacity of a country to identify suspect cases. This study estimated the number of seasonal excess deaths attributable to the COVID-19 epidemic in 31 provinces of Iran.

MethodsWe gathered the nationwide and provincial time series of the seasonal all-cause mortality data from spring 2015 to summer 2020 (21 March 2015 to 21 September 2020), in accordance with the Solar Hijri (SH) calendar, from the National Organization for Civil Registration (NOCR). We estimated the expected number of seasonal deaths for each province using a piecewise linear regression model which we established based on the mortality figures for the previous years and considered any significant deviations from the expectation during winter, spring, and summer of 2020 to be directly associated with COVID-19.

ResultsOur analysis shows that from the start of winter to the end of summer (from 22 December 2019 to 21 September 2020), there were a total of 58.9K (95%CI: 46.9K - 69.5K) excess deaths across all 31 provinces with 27% (95%CI: 20% - 34%) estimated nationwide exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, 2 provinces in the central and northern Iran, namely Qom and Golestan, had the highest level of exposure with 57% (95%CI: 44% - 69%) and 56% (95%CI: 44% - 69%), respectively, while another 27 provinces had significant levels of excess mortality in at least one season with >20% population-level exposure to the virus. We also detected unexpectedly high levels of excess mortality during fall 2019 (from 23 September to 21 December 2019) across 18 provinces. Our findings suggest that this spike cannot be a result of an early cryptic transmission of COVID-19 across the country and is also inconsistent with the molecular phylogenetics estimates for the start of the pandemic and its arrival to Iran. However, in the absence of appropriate surveillance data for detecting severe acute respiratory infections we were unable to make a determination as to what caused the spike in fall 2019.

509,Is the glass half full? Extraction-free RT-LAMP to detect SARS-CoV-2 is less sensitive but highly specific compared to standard RT-PCR in 101 samples,"The current scale of public and private testing cannot be expected to meet the emerging need for higher levels of community-level and repeated screening of asymptomatic Canadians for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid point-of-care techniques are increasingly being deployed to fill the gap in screening levels required to identify undiagnosed individuals with high viral loads. However, rapid, point-of-care tests often have lower sensitivity in practice. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 has proven sensitive and specific and provides visual results in minutes. Using a commercially available kit for RT-LAMP and primer set targetting nucleocapsid (N) gene, we tested a blinded set of 101 archived nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples with known RT-PCR results. RT-LAMP reactions were incubated at 65{degrees}C for 30 minutes, using heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab sample in viral transport medium, diluted tenfold in water, as input. RT-LAMP agreed with all RT-PCR defined negatives (N=51), and all positives with Ct less than 20 (N=24), 65% of positives with Ct between 20-30 (N=17), and no positives with Ct greater than 30 (N=9). RT-LAMP requires fewer and different core components, so may not compete directly with the mainline testing workflow, preserving precious central laboratory resources and gold standard tests for those with the greatest need. Careful messaging must be provided when using less-sensitive tests, so that people are not falsely reassured by negative results - ""glass half empty"" - in exchange for reliable detection of those with high levels of virus within an hour, using <$10 worth of chemicals - ""glass half full"".",John J Schellenberg; Margaret A.
