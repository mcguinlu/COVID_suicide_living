0,A Multi-center Study of COVID-19 with Multivariate Prognostic Analysis,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is now a global health concern.However, there is no detailed analysis of the factors related to patients improvement.We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, CT images, and treatment of COVID-19 patients from two different cities in China. Onehundred and sixty-ninepatients were recruited from January 27 to March 17, 2020 at five hospitals in Hubei and Guangxi. Theywere divided into four groups according to age and into two groups according to presence ofcomorbidities. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed for the prognosis of the disease. Fifty-two patients (30.8%) had comorbidities, and the percentage of critical COVID-19was higher in the comorbidities group (11.6%vs.0.9%, p<0.05). Older patients had higher proportion of severe or critical disease.The resultsshowed that lymphocyte count was significantly associated with thenumber ofdays from positive COVID-19 nucleic acid testto negative test; number of days from onset of symptoms to confirmation of diagnosis was significantly associated with the time it took forsymptoms to improve; andnumber of days from onset of symptomsto confirmation of diagnosis and disease severity were significantly associated withchest computed tomography improvement.

1,The quantitative landscape of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2,"Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) appear promising interventions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Over 100 NAbs have been identified so far and several are in clinical trials. Yet, which NAbs would be the most potent remains unclear. Here, we analysed reported in vitro dose-response curves (DRCs) of >70 NAbs and estimated corresponding 50% inhibitory concentrations, slope parameters, and instantaneous inhibitory potentials (IIPs), presenting a comprehensive quantitative landscape of NAb responses to SARS-CoV-2. NAbs with high IIPs are likely to be potent. To assess the applicability of the landscape in vivo, we analysed available DRCs of NAbs from individual patients and found that the responses closely resembled the landscape. Further, we created virtual patient plasma samples by randomly sampling NAbs from the landscape and found that they recapitulated plasma dilution assays from convalescent patients. The landscape thus offers a facile tool for benchmarking NAbs and would aid the development of NAb-based therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201996""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201996,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
2,"Improved Sensitivity, Safety, and Rapidity of COVID-19 Tests by Replacing Viral Storage Solution with Lysis Buffer","Conducting numerous, rapid, and reliable PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 is essential for our ability to monitor and control the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we tested the sensitivity and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples collected directly into a mix of lysis buffer and RNA preservative, thus inactivating the virus immediately after sampling. We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.1{+/-}0.6 (Mean{+/-}SE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests. Overall, we show that using NSLB instead of VTM can improve the sensitivity, safety, and rapidity of COVID-19 tests at a time most needed.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith; Kavithambigai Ellan; Nur Izwani Shaiful Bahrin; Nurul Shielawati Mohamed Rosli; Noorul Hidayah Badri; Teh Norleila Abdul Rahman; Arif Anwar; Rozainanee Mohd Zain; Kevin O.

3,Evolution of COVID-19 cases in selected low- and middle-income countries: past the herd immunity peak?,"We have studied the evolution of COVID-19 in 12 low and middle income countries in which reported cases have peaked and declined rapidly in the past 2-3 months. In most of these countries the declines happened while control measures were consistent or even relaxing, and without signs of significant increases in cases that might indicate second waves. For the 12 countries we studied, the hypothesis that these countries have reached herd immunity warrants serious consideration. The Reed-Frost model, perhaps the simplest description for the evolution of cases in an epidemic, with only a few constant parameters, fits the observed case data remarkably well, and yields parameter values that are reasonable. The best-fitting curves suggest that the effective basic reproduction number in these countries ranged between 1.5 and 2.0, indicating that the curve was flattened in some countries but not suppressed by pushing the reproduction number below 1. The results suggest that between 51 and 80% of the population in these countries have been infected, and that between 0.05% and 2.50% of cases have been detected; values which are consistent with findings from serological and T-cell immunity studies. The infection rates, combined with data and estimates for deaths from COVID-19, allow us to estimate overall infection fatality rates for three of the countries. The values are lower than expected from reported infection fatality rates by age, based on data from several high-income countries, and the country population by age. COVID-19 may have a lower mortality risk in these three countries (to differing degrees in each country) than in high-income countries, due to differences in immune response, prior exposure to coronaviruses, disease characteristics or other factors. We find that the herd immunity hypothesis would not have fit the evolution of reported cases in several European countries, even just after the initial peaks; and subsequent resurgences of cases obviously prove that those countries have infection rates well below herd immunity levels. Our hypothesis that the 12 countries we studied have reached herd immunity should now be tested further, through serological and T cell immunity studies.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20201814""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20201814,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
4,An optimal control policy for COVID-19 pandemic until a vaccine deployment,"When an outbreak starts spreading, policy makers have to make decisions that affects health of their citizens and the economic. Some might induce harsh measures, such as lockdown. Following a long harsh lockdown, economical declines force policy makers to rethink reopening. But what is the most effective reopening strategy? In order to provide an effective strategy, here we propose a control strategy model. Our model assesses the trade-off between social performance and limited medical resources by determining individuals' propensities. The proposed strategy also helps decision makers to find optimal lockdown and exit strategy for each region. Moreover, the financial loss is minimized. In addition, a study of a COVID-19 dataset for Los Angeles County is performed to validate our model and its results.",Jonathan M Blackburn,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202325""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202325,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
5,Base Reproduction Number of COVID-19: Statistic Analysis,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown up to be a pandemic within a short span of time. The quantification of COVID-19 transmissibility is desired for purposes of assessing the potential for a place to start an outbreak and the extent of transmission in the absence of control measures. It is well known that the transmissibility can be measured by reproduction number. For this reason, the large amount of research focuses on the estimations of reproduction number of COVID-19. However, these previous results are controversial and even misleading. To alleviate this problem, Liu et al advised to use averaging technique. Unfortunately, the fluctuant consequence principally arises from data error or model limitations rather than stochastic noise, where the averaging technique doesn't work well. The most likely estimation in USA and Wuhan is about 8.21 and 7.9. However, no enough evidence demonstrates the transmissibility increase of infectious agent of COVID-19 throughout the world.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202010""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202010,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
6,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies among Danish and Swedish Falck emergency and non-emergency healthcare workers,"Background: Knowledge about the COVID-19 outbreak is still sparse especially in a cross-national setting. COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers and evaluating whether certain job functions is associated with a higher risk of being infected, and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that the employees meet during a workday. Finally, we will investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence. Methods: A bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3,272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from June 22, 2020 until August 10, 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied. Results: Of the 3,272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity, and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group. Conclusions: Our study presents geographical variations in seroprevalence within the Falck organization and shows evidence that social interaction is one of the biggest risk factors for getting infected with SARS-CoV-2.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202259""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202259,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
7,Comparison of mental health service activity before and shortly after UK social distancing responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: February-March 2020,"This study sought to provide an early description of mental health service activity before and after national implementation of social distancing for COVID-19. A time series analysis was carried out of daily service-level activity on data from a large mental healthcare provider in southeast London, from 01.02.2020 to 31.03.2020, comparing activity before and after 16.03.2020: i) inpatient admissions, discharges and numbers, ii) contact numbers and daily caseloads (Liaison, Home Treatment Teams, Community Mental Health Teams); iii) numbers of deaths for past and present patients. Daily face-to-face contact numbers fell for liaison, home treatment and community services with incomplete compensatory rises in non-face-to-face contacts. Daily caseloads fell for all services, apart from working age and child/adolescent community teams. Inpatient numbers fell 13.6% after 16th March, and daily numbers of deaths increased by 61.8%.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith; Kavithambigai Ellan,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202150""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202150,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
8,Estimation of the fraction of COVID-19 infected people in U.S. states and countries worldwide,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths have been publicly reported in real-time to control the virus spread. However, substantial undocumented infections have obscured the true prevalence of the virus. A machine learning framework was developed to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in 50 countries and 50 U.S. states from reported test results and deaths, as well as published epidemiological parameters. Severe under-reporting of cases was found to be universal. Our framework projects for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. ~10% of the population has been once infected. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population is estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York the fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202382""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202382,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
9,Sleep apnoea is a risk factor for severe COVID-19,"Objective: To investigate if obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19. To examine whether the risk for contracting COVID-19 is elevated among OSA patients. Design and setting: Registry based retrospective case-control study using Finnish nationwide health registries and the FinnGen Study cohort. Participants: Information regarding OSA diagnosis and COVID-19 infection was extracted from the FinnGen study (N=260,405) with a total of 305 patients who had a recorded PCR-validated COVID-19 infection including 26 (8.5%) individuals who were also OSA patients. Severe COVID-19 (N=83, 27.2%) was defined as an infection requiring hospitalization. Among the hospitalized individuals there were 16 (19.3%) with OSA diagnosis. In addition, we also included in our analysis previously reported risk factors for both severe COVID-19 or risk factors and comorbidities for OSA from FinnGen. Main outcome measures: OSA diagnosis, information concerning COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization, were derived from Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry, Causes of Death Registry and the National Infectious Diseases Registry. Results: We show that OSA is a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization independent from age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (p-unadjusted=1.04x10^-4, OR-adjusted=5.24 [95%CI 1.33 to 23.43], p-adjusted=0.022). OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19 (p=0.49). Conclusion: While an OSA patients risk of contracting COVID-19 is the same as non-OSA individuals, the OSA patients have a five-fold risk to be hospitalized when affected by COVID-19 than non-OSA individuals. Our findings suggest that, in assessment of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, OSA needs to be recognized as one of the comorbidity risk factors for developing a severe form of the disease.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith; Kavithambigai Ellan; Nur Izwani Shaiful Bahrin; Nurul Shielawati Mohamed Rosli; Noorul Hidayah Badri; Teh Norleila Abdul Rahman,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202051""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202051,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
10,Excess Risk of COVID-19 to University Populations Resulting from In-Person Sporting Events,"Background: One of the consequences of COVID-19 has been the cancelation of in-person collegiate sporting events. We explore the impact of having in-person sports on COVID-19 transmission on a college campus, specifically the excess cases within the campus community can be anticipated. Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model representing the interactions between the university community, we model the impact of transient influxes of visitors attending sporting events and ancillary activities (bars, dining out, etc.). We consider a number of scenarios, varying the extent to which visitors interact with the campus, the number of infectious visitors, and the extent to which the campus has controlled COVID-19 absent events. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis, exploring the model's outcomes over a wide range of uncertainty. Results: Events caused an increase in the number of cases among the campus community, ranging from a 25% increase in a scenario where the campus already had an uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had a low prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed lightly with the campus community to an 822% increase where the campus had controlled their COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had both a high prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed heavily with the campus community. The model was insensitive to parameter uncertainty, save for the duration a symptomatic individual was infectious. Conclusion: In-person sporting events represent a threat to the health of the campus community. This is the case even in circumstances where COVID-19 seems controlled both on-campus and among the larger population visitors are drawn from.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith; Kavithambigai Ellan,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202499""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.27.20202499,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
11,Trajectory of COVID-19 epidemic in Europe,"The classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model formulated by Kermack and McKendrick assumes that all individuals in the population are equally susceptible to infection. From fitting such a model to the trajectory of mortality from COVID-19 in 11 European countries up to 4 May 2020 Flaxman et al. concluded that ""major non-pharmaceutical interventions -- and lockdowns in particular -- have had a large effect on reducing transmission"". We show that relaxing the assumption of homogeneity to allow for individual variation in susceptibility or connectivity gives a model that has better fit to the data and more accurate 14-day forward prediction of mortality. Allowing for heterogeneity reduces the estimate of ""counterfactual"" deaths that would have occurred if there had been no interventions from 3.2 million to 262,000, implying that most of the slowing and reversal of COVID-19 mortality is explained by the build-up of herd immunity. The estimate of the herd immunity threshold depends on the value specified for the infection fatality ratio (IFR): a value of 0.3% for the IFR gives 15% for the average herd immunity threshold.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202267""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202267,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
12,SARS-CoV-2 Uses CD4 to Infect T Helper Lymphocytes,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent of a major global outbreak of respiratory tract disease known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infects the lungs and may cause several immune-related complications such as lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm which are associated with the severity of the disease and predict mortality . The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in immune system dysfunction is not fully understood. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human CD4+ T helper cells, but not CD8+ T cells, and is present in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage T helper cells of severe COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) directly binds to the CD4 molecule, which in turn mediates the entry of SARS- CoV-2 in T helper cells in a mechanism that also requires ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Once inside T helper cells, SARS-CoV-2 assembles viral factories, impairs cell function and may cause cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infected T helper cells express higher amounts of IL-10, which is associated with viral persistence and disease severity. Thus, CD4-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of T helper cells may explain the poor adaptive immune response of many COVID- 19 patients.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith; Kavithambigai Ellan; Nur Izwani Shaiful Bahrin; Nurul Shielawati Mohamed Rosli; Noorul Hidayah Badri; Teh Norleila Abdul Rahman; Arif Anwar; Rozainanee Mohd Zain; Kevin O.

METHODS This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. From February 5, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 98 consecutive patients classified as critical COVID-19 were included in Huo Shen Shan Hospital. The final date of follow-up was March 29, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS Of the 98 patients, 43 (43.9%) died in hospital, 37(37.8%) discharged, and 18(18.4%) remained in hospital. The mean age was 68.5 (63, 75) years, and 57 (58.2%) were female. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (68.4%), followed by diabetes (17.3%), angina pectoris (13.3%). Except the sex (Female: 68.8% vs 49.1%, P=0.039) and angina pectoris (20.9% vs 7.3%, P = 0.048), there was no difference in other demographics and comorbidities between non-survivor and survivor groups.

15,"A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Pregnancy and COVID-19: Signs and Symptoms, Laboratory Tests and Perinatal Outcomes","Background: COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Objective: We aimed to investigate the clinical manifestation include signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed via LitCovid hub, Embase, Scopus, Web of sciences, and Google scholar on 07 April 2020. Meta-analysis was performed via CMA software using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The event rate with 95% CI was calculated for each variable. Results: Ten studies were selected. The pooled prevalence for fever, post-partum fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, sore throat, and diarrhea were 66.8 %, 37.1 %, 35.5 %, 24.6 %, 14.9%, 14.6 %, 11.5%, and 7.6 %, respectively. Laboratory test results were 49.8 % for lymphopenia, 47.7 % for leukocytosis, 83.7 % for elevated neutrophil ratio, 57 % for elevated C-reactive protein, and 71.4 % for decreased lymphocyte ratio.

16,Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19: A living systematic review,"Objective This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 Methods We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. Eligible studies were randomised trials evaluating the effect of remdesivir versus placebo or no treatment. We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that maps PICO questions to a repository maintained through regular searches in electronic databases, preprint servers, trial registries and other resources relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned, standardised form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included 3 randomised trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large reduction in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence). Conclusions The evidence is insufficient for the outcomes critical for making decisions about the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so it is not possible to balance the potential benefits, if any, with the adverse effects and costs.

In so doing, we introduce (for the first time) the ratio R^(c,d)_{I/T} of the cumulative and daily numbers of infected persons over the corresponding one of tests which are expected to be less sensitive to the number of the tests because the credibility of the results based only on the absolute numbers often raises some criticisms. We also give and compare the reproduction number R_eff from different approaches and with the ones of some European countries with a small number of population (Greece, Switzerland) and some other African countries.

Complete blood count changes, including new cell activation parameters, from 982 confirmed COVID-19 adult patients from 11 European hospitals were retrospectively analysed for distinctive patterns based on age, gender, clinical severity, symptom duration and hospital days. The observed haemocytometric patterns formed the basis to develop a multi-haemocytometric-parameter prognostic score to predict, during the first three days after presentation, which patients will recover without ventilation or deteriorate within a two-week timeframe, needing intensive care or with fatal outcome. The prognostic score, with ROC curve AUC at baseline of 0.753 (95% CI 0.723-0.781) increasing to 0.875 (95% CI 0.806-0.926) on day 3, was superior to any individual parameter at distinguishing between clinical severity.

19,"Strong impact of closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks during the Covid-19 pandemic: results from a simple and revealing analysis","Many complex mathematical and epidemiological methods have been used to model the Covid-19 pandemic. Among other results from these models has been the view that closing schools had little impact on infection rates in several countries1. We took a different approach. Making one assumption, we simply plotted cases, hospitalizations and deaths, on a log2 Y axis and a linear date-based X axis, and analyzed them using segmented regression, a powerful method that has largely been overlooked during this pandemic. Here we show that the data fit straight lines with correlation coefficients ranging from 92% - 99%, and that these lines broke at interesting intervals, revealing that school closings dropped infection rates in half, lockdowns dropped the rates 3 to 4 fold, and other actions (such as closing bars and mandating masks) brought the rates even further down. Hospitalizations and deaths paralleled cases, with lags of three to ten days. The graphs, which are easy to read, reveal changes in infection rates that are not obvious using other graphing methods, and have several implications for modeling and policy development during this and future pandemics. Overall, other than full lockdowns, three interventions had the most impact: closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks: a message easily understood by the public.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202457""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202457,2020-09-28,2020-09-28,,True
20,"Influence of COVID-19 confinement measures on appendectomies in Germany - administrative claims data analysis of 9,797 patients","Purpose: COVID 19 pandemic had multiple influences on the social, industrial and medical situation in all affected countries. Measures of obligatory medical confinement were suspensions of scheduled non-emergent surgical procedures and outpatients clinics as well as overall access restrictions to hospitals and medical practices. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess if the obligatory confinement (lockdown) had an effect on the number of appendectomies (during and after the period of lockdown). Methods: This retrospective study was based on anonymized nationwide administrative claims data of the German Local General Sickness Fund (AOK). Patients admitted for disease of the appendix (ICD-10: K35-K38) or abdominal and pelvic pain (ICD-10: R10) who undergone an appendectomy (OPS: 5-470) were included. The study period included six weeks of German lockdown (16.03.-26.04.2020) as well as six weeks before (03.02.-15.03.2020) and after (27.04.-07.06.2020). These periods were compared to the respective in 2019. Results: Overall number of appendectomies was significantly reduced during the lockdown time in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease affects only appendectomies due to acute simple and non-acute appendicitis. Numbers for appendectomies in acute complex appendicitis remained unchanged. Female patients and in the age group 1-18 years showed the strongest decrease in number of cases. Conclusion: The lockdown in Germany resulted in a decreased number of appendectomies. This affected mainly appendectomies in simple acute and non-acute appendicitis, but not complicated acute appendicitis. The study gives no evidence, that the confinement measures resulted in a deterioration of medical care for appendicitis.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20198986""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20198986,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
21,Equity in Paediatric Emergency Departments during COVID-19,Childrens attendances in paediatric emergency departments have fallen precipitously in North East England and elsewhere in recent months. We analysed data from 3 hospitals to understand which children were not being brought during the COVID-19 lockdown. In our population there is no evidence of a disproportionate impact on children belonging to vulnerable sociodemographic groups and no obvious change in illness acuity among those children still attending. However we noted a marked reduction in infectious disease presentations which might reflect one positive impact of enhanced social distancing on child health. More granular data describing the collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic to childrens clinical services are needed to plan for the mitigation of its continuing effects.,Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith; Kavithambigai Ellan,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201533""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201533,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
22,The Use of Psychoactive Substances in the Context of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Brazil,"Background: The protocols for mitigating the transmission of Covid-19 seem to be a trigger for the use of psychoactive substances, as an individual's adaptive response to support this new way of being in the world. Objective: To investigate the use of psychoactive substances in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. Method: A cross-sectional and prospective observational study, undertaken in a virtual environment. An online survey was developed and employed through Google Forms to collect data. The survey was made available to participants on social networks, Facebook@, Whatsapp@, and Instagram@, linked to the research group, during the period 06/15/2020 to 07/15/2020. 1,145 individuals participated in the research. Results: The average age of the participants was 37 years old. They were mostly female, white, Brazilians, with a higher education level, with occupations in the health field, and had religion. They either maintained their family income or suffered a small income decrease. Moreover, they informed that they were caring for social isolation. The most used substances before and after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic were alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, although the use of these substances decreased (P<0.001). Approximately 32% of the participants started using psychoactive substances in this period. Among them, most individuals started by their own initiative. Conclusions: For a better understanding of the pattern use of psychoactive substances during the Covid-19 pandemic and the adverse effects on human behavior and mental disorders, careful longitudinal studies must be developed, due to the great interest in the knowledge of adaptive responses when people's lives are at risk.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20194431""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20194431,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
23,COVID-19 in Youth Soccer,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the case and incidence rates of COVID-19 among youth soccer players and evaluate the relationship with background COVID-19 risk and phase of return to play. Methods: Surveys were distributed to soccer clubs throughout the country regarding their phase of return to soccer (individual only, group non-contact, group contact) and date of reinitiation, number of players, cases of COVID-19, and risk reduction procedures that were being implemented. Overall case and incidence rates were compared to national pediatric data and county data from the prior 10 weeks where available. Finally, a negative binomial regression model was developed to predict club COVID-19 cases with local incidence rate and phase of return as covariates and the log of club player-days as an offset. Results: 129 clubs responded, of whom 124 had reinitiated soccer, representing 91,007 players with a median duration of 73 days (IQR: 53-83 days) since restarting. Of the 119 that had progressed to group activities, 218 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 85,861 players. Youth soccer players had a lower case rate and incidence rate than the national rate for children in the US (254 v. 477 cases per 100,000; IRR = 0.511, 95% CI = [0.40-0.57], p<0.001) and the general population from the counties in which soccer clubs were based where data was available (268 v. 864 cases per 100,000; IRR = 0.202 [0.19-0.21], p<0.001). After adjusting for local COVID-19 incidence, there was no relationship between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return (non-contact: {beta}=0.35{+/-}0.67, p=0.61; contact: {beta}=0.18{+/-}0.67, p=0.79). No cases were reported to have resulted in hospitalization or death. 100% of clubs reported having a plan in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and utilizing multiple different risk reduction procedures (median 8, IQR 6-10). Conclusions: The incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes is relatively low when compared to the background incidence among children in the United States and the local general population. No relationship was identified between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return to soccer.

24,Cost-effectiveness of remdesivir and dexamethasone for COVID-19 treatment in South Africa,"Background South Africa recently experienced a first peak in COVID-19 cases and mortality. Dexamethasone and remdesivir both have the potential to reduce COVID-related mortality, but their cost-effectiveness in a resource-limited setting with scant intensive care resources is unknown. Methods We projected intensive care unit (ICU) needs and capacity from August 2020 to January 2021 using the South African National COVID-19 Epi Model. We assessed cost-effectiveness of 1) administration of dexamethasone to ventilated patients and remdesivir to non-ventilated patients, 2) dexamethasone alone to both non-ventilated and ventilated patients, 3) remdesivir to non-ventilated patients only, and 4) dexamethasone to ventilated patients only; all relative to a scenario of standard care. We estimated costs from the healthcare system perspective in 2020 USD, deaths averted, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratios of each scenario. Results Remdesivir for non-ventilated patients and dexamethasone for ventilated patients was estimated to result in 1,111 deaths averted (assuming a 0-30% efficacy of remdesivir) compared to standard care, and save $11.5 million. The result was driven by the efficacy of the drugs, and the reduction of ICU-time required for patients treated with remdesivir. The scenario of dexamethasone alone to ventilated and non-ventilated patients requires additional $159,000 and averts 1,146 deaths, resulting in $139 per death averted, relative to standard care. Conclusions The use of dexamethasone for ventilated and remdesivir for non-ventilated patients is likely to be cost-saving compared to standard care.

25,Dynamic Modeling of Reported Covid-19 Cases and Deaths with Continuously Varying Case Fatality and Transmission Rate Functions,"In this paper, we propose an enhanced SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Death) model with time varying case fatality and transmission rates for confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. We show that when case fatalities and transmission rates are represented by simple Sigmoid functions, historical cases and fatalities can be fit with a relative-root-mean-squared-error accuracy on the order of 2% for most American states over the period from initial cases to July 20 (2020). We find that the model is most accurate for states that so far had not shown signs of multiple waves of the disease (such as New York), and least accurate for states where transmission rates increased after initially declining (such as Hawaii). For such states, we propose an alternate multi-phase model. Both the base model and multi-phase model provide a way to explain historical reported cases and deaths with a small set of parameters, which in the future can enable analyses of uncertainty and variations in disease progression across regions.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201905""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201905,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
26,Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human upper and lower respiratory tracts and their relationship with infectiousness,"SARS-CoV-2 is a human pathogen that causes infection in both the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the lower respiratory tract (LRT). The viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they relate to infectiousness and disease progression are not well understood. Here, we develop data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the URT and LRT. We fit the models to viral load data from patients with likely infection dates known, we estimated that infected individuals with a longer incubation period had lower rates of viral growth, took longer to reach peak viremia in the URT, and had higher chances of presymptomatic transmission. We then developed a model linking viral load to infectiousness. We found that to explain the substantial fraction of transmissions occurring presymptomatically, the infectiousness of a person should depend on a saturating function of the viral load, making the logarithm of the URT viral load a better surrogate of infectiousness than the viral load itself. Comparing the roles of target-cell limitation, the innate immune response, proliferation of target cells and spatial infection in the LRT, we found that spatial dissemination in the lungs is likely to be an important process in sustaining the prolonged high viral loads. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for predicting how SARS-CoV-2 within-host dynamics determine infectiousness and represent a step towards quantifying how viral load dynamics and the immune responses determine disease severity.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201772""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201772,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
27,Deep Immune Profiling of MIS-C demonstrates marked but transient immune activation compared to adult and pediatric COVID-19,"Pediatric COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with fewer hospitalizations and often milder disease than in adults. A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that correlated with use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation. Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith; Kavithambigai Ellan; Nur Izwani Shaiful Bahrin; Nurul Shielawati Mohamed Rosli; Noorul Hidayah Badri; Teh Norleila Abdul Rahman; Arif Anwar; Rozainanee Mohd Zain; Kevin O.

28,Prioritising COVID-19 vaccination in changing social and epidemiological landscapes,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities must decide which groups to prioritise for vaccination. These decision will occur in a constantly shifting social-epidemiological landscape where the success of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like physical distancing requires broad population acceptance. We developed a coupled social-epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Schools and workplaces are closed and re-opened based on reported cases. We used evolutionary game theory and mobility data to model individual adherence to NPIs. We explored the impact of vaccinating 60+ year-olds first; <20 year-olds first; uniformly by age; and a novel contact-based strategy. The last three strategies interrupt transmission while the first targets a vulnerable group. Vaccination rates ranged from 0.5% to 4.5% of the population per week, beginning in January or July 2021. Case notifications, NPI adherence, and lockdown periods undergo successive waves during the simulated pandemic. Vaccination reduces median deaths by 32%-77% (22%-63%) for January (July) availability, depending on the scenario. Vaccinating 60+ year-olds first prevents more deaths (up to 8% more) than transmission-interrupting strategies for January vaccine availability across most parameter regimes. In contrast, transmission-interrupting strategies prevent up to 33% more deaths than vaccinating 60+ year-olds first for July availability, due to higher levels of natural immunity by that time. Sensitivity analysis supports the findings. Further research is urgently needed to determine which populations can benefit from using SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to interrupt transmission.",Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201889""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201889,2020-09-27,2020-09-27,,True
29,"Quantitative, Epitope-specific, Serological Screening of COVID-19 Patients Using a Novel Multiplexed Array-based Immunoassay Platform","Following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in late 2019, a large number of antibody tests were developed for use in seroprevalence studies aimed at determining the extent of current or previous SARS-CoV-2 virus infections in a given population. The vast majority of these tests are qualitative and use a single target for antibody detection, incorporating either full-length or truncated versions of the nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins from SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, mono-epitope tests - whether qualitative or quantitative - are unable to localise antibody binding or characterise the distribution and titres of epitope recognition by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within an individual or across a population. However, it seems plausible that if such information were available, it may correlate with the presence of potent, high-titre, neutralising antibodies that afford protection again imminent re-infection, as well as with the likelihood of developing a memory B-cell response that would provide more durable protection. We have developed a novel, quantitative, multi-antigen, multiplexed, array-based immunoassay platform, ImmuSAFE COVID+ (ImmuSAFE) comprising 6 functionally validated domains or regions of the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed using Sengenics KREX technology. This array platform enables determination of both the position and breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses following natural infection or vaccination. To validate our platform, 100 serum samples (confirmed sero-positive COVID-19 cases, n=50; pre-pandemic HIV positive controls, n=50) were tested for IgG seropositivity to the N antigen, yielding 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. All 50 cases showed positive antibody reactivity towards at least one N protein epitope, whilst all 50 controls showed antibody reactivity below threshold values. Broad variation was also observed in the magnitude and breadth of antibodies present, represented as an Epitope Coverage score (EPC). A positive correlation was observed between increasing age and EPC values, with individuals under 40 years old having a mean EPC score of 3.1, whilst individuals above the age of 60 had a mean EPC of 5.1.

Then, with a single flocked swab the back of the throat and subsequently the nasopharynx were sampled. Samples were inactivated and analysed on a Roche cobas 6800 system with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 test. Results: Of 76 persons, 39 (51%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oro-nasopharyngeal swab. Mouthwash detected 13 (17%) of these infections but did not detect any additional infection. Samples that were positive in both tests, had lower cycle threshold (Ct)-values for oro-nasopharyngeal samples, indicating a higher virus concentration, compared to samples only positive in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs.

32,High admission blood glucose is an independent risk factor of poor prognosis in COVID-19: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis,"Aims To investigate the prognostic value of admission blood glucose (BG) in predicting COVID-19 outcomes, including poor composite outcomes (mortality/severity), mortality, and severity. Materials and methods Eligible studies evaluating the prognostic value of fasting BG (FBG) and random BG (RBG) levels in predicting COVID-19 outcomes were included and assessed for risk of bias with the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Random-effects high-vs-low meta-analysis followed by dose-response analysis using generalized least squares model in a two-stage random-effects meta-analysis were conducted. Potential non-linear association was explored using restricted cubic splines and pooled using restricted maximum likelihood model in a multivariate meta-analysis. Results The search yielded 35 studies involving a total of 14,502 patients. We discovered independent association between admission FBG and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated non-linear relationship between admission FBG and severity (Pnon-linearity<0.001), where each 1 mmol/L increase augmented the risk of COVID-19 severity by 33% (risk ratio 1.33 [95% CI: 1.26-1.40]). Albeit exhibiting similar trends, study scarcity limited the strength of evidence on the independent prognostic value of admission RBG. GRADE assessment yielded high-quality evidence for the association between admission FBG and COVID-19 severity, and moderate-quality evidence for its association with mortality and poor outcomes, while the other assessments yielded very low-to-low quality. Conclusion High level of FBG at admission was independently associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Further researches to confirm the observed prognostic value of admission RBG and to ascertain the estimated dose-response risk between admission FBG and on COVID-19 severity are required.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

33,"INFERRED RESOLUTION THROUGH HERD IMMMUNITY OF FIRST COVID-19 WAVE IN MANAUS, BRAZILIAN AMAZON","As in many other settings, peak excess mortality preceded the officially reported `first wave' peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Manaus, Brazil, reflecting delayed case recognition and limited initial access to diagnostic testing. To avoid early information bias, we used detailed age and gender stratified death certificate and hospitalisation data to evaluate the epidemic's trajectory and infer the cause of its decline using a stochastic model. Our results are consistent with heterogenous transmission reducing over time due to the development of herd immunity. Relative to a baseline model that assumed homogenous mixing across Manaus, a model that permitted a small, self-isolated population fraction raised the estimated herd-immunity threshold from 28% to 30% and reduced the final attack rate from 86% to 65%. In the latter scenario, a substantial proportion of vulnerable, older individuals remained susceptible to infection. Given uncertainties regarding the distancing behaviours of population subgroups with different social and economic characteristics, and the duration of sterilising or transmission-modifying immunity in exposed individuals, we conclude that the potential for epidemic outbreaks remains, but that future waves of infection are likely to be much less pronounced than that already experienced.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

34,Airway emergency management in a pediatric hospital before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective Children's hospitals frequently care for infants with various life-threatening airway anomalies. Management of these infants can be challenging given unique airway anatomy and potential malformations. Airway emergency management must be immediate and precise, often demanding specialized equipment and/or expertise. We developed a Neonatal-Infant Airway Safety Program to improve medical responses, communication, equipment usage and outcomes for infants requiring emergent airway interventions. Patients and Methods All patients admitted to our quaternary neonatal and infant intensive care unit (NICU) from 2008-2019 were included in this study. Our program consisted of a multidisciplinary airway response team, pager system, and emergency equipment cart. Respiratory therapists present at each emergency event recorded specialist response times, equipment utilization, and outcomes. A multidisciplinary oversite committee reviewed each incident. Results Since 2008, there were 159 airway emergency events in our NICU (~12 per year). Mean specialist response times decreased from 5.9{+/-}4.9 min (2008-2012, mean{+/-}SD) to 4.3{+/-}2.2 min (2016-2019, p=0.12), and the number of incidents with response times >5 min decreased from 28.8{+/-}17.8% (2008-2012) to 9.3{+/-}11.4% (2016-2019, p=0.04 by linear regression). As our program became more standardized, we noted better equipment availability and subspecialist communication. Few emergency situations (n=9, 6%) required operating room management. There were 3 patient deaths (2%). Conclusions Our airway safety program, including readily available specialists and equipment, facilitated effective resolution of airway emergencies in our NICU and multidisciplinary involvement enabled rapid and effective changes in response to COVID-19 regulations.

35,Antihypertensive Medications and COVID-19 Diagnosis and Mortality: Population-based Case-Control Analysis in the United Kingdom,"Objectives: To evaluate antihypertensive medications and COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality, accounting for healthcare seeking behaviour. Design: A population-based case control study with additional cohort analysis. Setting: Primary care patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Participants: 16 866 patients with COVID-19 events in the CPRD from 29th January to June 25th 2020 and 70 137 matched controls. Main outcome measures: We explored associations between COVID-19 diagnosis and prescriptions for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (B), calcium-channel blockers (C), thiazide diuretics (D) and other antihypertensive drugs (O). We evaluated all-cause mortality among COVID-19 cases. Analyses were adjusted for covariates and consultation frequency. Results: In covariate adjusted analyses, ACEIs were associated with lower odds of COVID-19 diagnosis (0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.88) as were ARBs, 0.87 (0.80 to 0.95) with little attenuation from adjustment for consultation frequency. In fully adjusted analyses, C and D were also associated with lower odds of COVID-19. Increased odds of COVID-19 for B (1.19, 1.12 to 1.26), were attenuated after adjustment for consultation frequency (1.01, 0.95 to 1.08). In adjusted analyses, patients treated with ACEIs or ARBs had similar mortality to patients treated with classes B, C, D or O (1.00, 0.83 to 1.20) or patients receiving no antihypertensive therapy (0.99, 0.83 to 1.18). Conclusions: Associations were sensitive to adjustment for confounding and healthcare seeking, but there was no evidence that antihypertensive therapy is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality; most classes of antihypertensive therapy showed negative associations with COVID-19 diagnosis.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

36,Hearing the voices of Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The statistics of healthcare worker (HCW) COVID-19 infections do not convey the lived experience of HCWs during the pandemic. This study explores the working conditions and issues faced by Australian HCWs. Methods: Qualitative analysis of free-text responses from Australian HCWs from 3 August to 5 August 2020 from an open letter calling for better respiratory protection for HCWs, transparent reporting of HCW COVID-19 infections and diversity in national infection control policy development. The open letter was sent to an email list of 23,000 HCWs from a previous campaign and promoted on social media. Results: Among 2,733 HCWs who signed the open letter during the study period, 407 free-text responses were analysed. Doctors and nurses accounted for 58% and 35% of respondents, respectively. Most respondents came from Victoria (48%); New South Wales (18%); Queensland (12%) or Western Australia (12%). Dominant themes included concerns about: work health and safety standards; guidelines on respiratory protection including the omission of fit-testing of P2/N95 respirators; deficiencies in the availability, quality, appropriateness and training of personal protective equipment; a top-down workplace culture that enabled bullying in response to concerns about safety that culminated a loss of trust in leadership, self-reported COVID-19 infections in some respondents and moral injury. Conclusion: Occupational moral injury in HCWs is the consequence of lapses in leadership at policy-making and organisational levels that have violated the normative expectations of HCWs. The challenge for healthcare leaders is to address workplace culture, consultation and engagement with HCWs in order to prevent this hidden pandemic from spreading throughout the health system.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

37,"Onset, duration, and persistence of taste and smell changes and other COVID-19 symptoms: longitudinal study in Israeli patients","Objectives: The multifaceted disease manifestation of COVID-19 requires longitudinal characterization of symptoms, to aid with screening and disease management. Methods: Phone interviews and follow-ups were completed with 112 mild COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive adult patients, over a 6 week period. Results: More than one symptom at disease onset was experienced by ~70 of the patients. Over one third of patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, or muscle ache as the first symptom. If fatigue was reported, it was usually the first symptom to appear. Smell and taste changes had occurred 3.9 {+/-} 5.4 and 4.6 {+/-} 5.7 days (mean {+/-} SD) since disease onset and emerged as first symptoms in 15% and 18% of patients, respectively. Fever was the shortest lasting symptom (5.8 {+/-} 8.6 days (mean {+/-} SD), and smell and taste changes were the most long-lasting symptoms (24.3 {+/-} 22.9 days and 19.4 {+/-} 19.1 (mean {+/-} SD), respectively), with longer smell recovery correlated with smell change severity. In one third of patients who reported cough, smell and taste changes, these symptoms persisted after negative RT-PCR tests. Conclusions: Each symptom can occur as first or later, though some are more likely to appear as firsts, and typically more than one symptom occurs at disease onset. The severity of olfactory change is associated with its recovery time. Lack of chemosensory recuperation in recovered patients is common.

Large-scale testing is limited by the need for in-person blood collection by staff trained in venepuncture. Capillary blood self-sampling and postage to laboratories for analysis could provide a reliable alternative. Two-hundred and nine matched venous and capillary blood samples were obtained from thirty nine participants and analysed using a COVID-19 IgG ELISA to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Thirty seven out of thirty eight participants were able to self-collect an adequate sample of capillary blood ([&ge;]50 l). Using plasma from venous blood collected in lithium heparin as the reference standard, matched capillary blood samples, collected in lithium heparin-treated tubes and on filter paper as dried blood spots, achieved a Cohen's kappa coefficient of >0.88 (near-perfect agreement).

39,Modeling COVID-19 as a National Dynamics with a SARS-CoV-2 Prevalent Variant: Brazil - A Study Case,"COVID-19 global dynamics is modeled by an adaptation of the deterministic SEIR Model, which takes into account two dominant lineages of the SARS-CoV-2, and a time-varying reproduction number to estimate the disease transmission behavior. Such a methodology can be applied worldwide to predict forecasts of the outbreak in any infected country. The pandemic in Brazil was selected as a first study case. Brazilian official published data from February 25th to August 30th, 2020 was used to adjust a few epidemiologic parameters. The estimated time-dependence mean value to the infected individuals (confirmed cases) presents - in logarithmic scale - standard deviation SD = 0.08 for over six orders of magnitude. Data points for additional three weeks were added after the model was complete, granting confidence on the outcomes. By the end of 2020, the predicted numbers of confirmed cases in Brazil, within 95% credible intervals, may reach 6 Million (5 to 7), and fatalities would accounts for 180 (130 to 220) thousands. The total number of infected individuals is estimated to reach (13 +/- 1) Million, 6.2% of the Brazilian population.

There is currently no approved vaccine to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and only very few treatment options are available to manage COVID-19 patients. For development of preclinical countermeasures, reliable and well-characterized small animal disease models will be of paramount importance. Here we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into Syrian hamsters consistently caused moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia, with high viral lung loads and extensive virus shedding, but animals only displayed transient mild disease. We determined the infectious dose 50 to be only five infectious particles, making the Syrian hamster a highly susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither hamster age nor sex had any impact on the severity of disease or course of infection. Finally, prolonged viral persistence in interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain knockout hamsters revealed susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to adaptive immune control.

Methods: A new electrostatic filter was placed before (pre) or after (post) the bubble CPAP generator, or with no filter (control) in an in vitro study. Pressure was recorded at the nasal interface for 18 h (6 L/min; 7 cmH2O) on three occasions for each configuration. Filter failure was defined as pressure >9 cmH20 for 60 continuous minutes. The filter was weighed before and after each experiment. Results: Mean (SD) time to reach the fail-point was 257 (116) min and 525 (566) min for filter placement pre- and post-CPAP generator, respectively. Mean pressure was higher throughout in the pre-generator position compared to control. The filter weight was heavier at study end in the pre- compared to the post-generator position. Conclusions: Placement of the filter at the pre-generator position in a bubble CPAP circuit should be avoided due to unstable mean pressure.

44,Public health information on COVID-19 for international travellers: Lessons learned from a rapid mixed-method evaluation in the UK containment phase,"Introduction In the containment phase of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Public Health England (PHE) delivered advice to travellers arriving at major UK ports. We aimed to rapidly evaluate the impact and effectiveness of these communication materials for passengers in the early stages of the pandemic. Methods In stage I (Patient and Public Involvement, PPI) we interviewed seven travellers who had returned from China in January and February 2020. We used these results to develop a questionnaire and topic guides for stage II, a cross-sectional survey and follow-up interviews with passengers arriving at London Heathrow Airport on scheduled flights from China and Singapore. The survey assessed passengers' knowledge of symptoms, actions to take and attitudes towards PHE COVID-19 public health information; interviews explored their views of official public health information and self-isolation. Results In stage II, 121 passengers participated in the survey and 15 in follow-up interviews. 83% of surveyed passengers correctly identified all three COVID-19 associated symptoms listed in PHE information at that time. Most could identify the recommended actions and found the advice understandable and trustworthy. Interviews revealed that passengers shared concerns about the lack of wider official action, and that passengers' knowledge had been acquired elsewhere as much from PHE. Respondents also noted their own agency in choosing to self-isolate, partially as a self-protective measure. Conclusion PHE COVID-19 public health information was perceived as clear and acceptable, but we found that passengers acquired knowledge from various sources and they saw the provision of information alone on arrival as an insufficient official response. Our study provides fresh insights into the importance of taking greater account of diverse information sources and of the need for public assurance in creating public health information materials to address global health threats.

45,Impact of Personal Care Habits on Post-Lockdown COVID-19 Contagion: Insights from Agent-based Simulations,"After the first wave of spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world are struggling to recover their economies by slowly lifting the mobility restrictions and social distance measures enforced during the crisis. Therefore, the post-lockdown containment of the disease will depend strongly not any more on government-imposed interventions but on personal care measures, taken voluntarily by their citizens. In this respect, recent studies have shed some light regarding the effectiveness individual protection habits may have in preventing SARS-Cov-2 transmission, particularly physical contact distancing, facial mask wearing and hand-washing habits. In this paper we describe experiments performed on a simulated COVID-19 epidemic in an artificial population using an agent based model, so as to illustrate to what extent the interplay between such personal care habits contributes to mitigate the spread of the disease, assuming the lack of other population-wide non-pharmaceutical interventions or vaccines. We discuss scenarios where wide adherence to these voluntary care habits alone, can be enough to contain the unfold of the contagion.

There is no clinically automated tool to quantify the infection of COVID-19 patients. Automatic segmentation of lung opacification from computed tomography (CT) images provides excellent potential, which is of great significance for judging the disease development and treatment response of the patients. However, the segmentation of lung opacification from CT slices still faces some challenges, including the complexity and variability features of the opacity regions, the small difference between the infected and healthy tissues, and the noise of CT images. Besides, due to the limited medical resources, it is impractical to obtain a large amount of data in a short time, which further hinders the training of deep learning models. To answer these challenges, we proposed a novel spatial and channel-wise coarse-to-fine attention network (CAT-Net) inspired by the biological vision mechanism, which is for the segmentation of COVID-19 lung opacification from CT Images. CAT-Net has the spatial-wise attention module and the channel-wise attention module to attract the self-attention learning of the network, which serves to extract the practical features at the pixel and channel level successfully.

47,The potential health and economic value of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alongside physical distancing in the UK: transmission model-based future scenario analysis and economic evaluation,"Background In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the UK adopted mandatory physical distancing measures in March 2020. Vaccines against the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may become available as early as late 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing scenarios in the UK. Methods We used an age-structured dynamic-transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of immunisation programmes over ten years. Assuming vaccines are effective in 5-64 year olds, we compared vaccinating 90% of individuals in this age group to no vaccination. We assumed either vaccine effectiveness of 25% and 1-year protection and 90% re-vaccinated annually, or 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection and 10% re-vaccinated annually. Natural immunity was assumed to last 45 weeks in the base case. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing. We considered benefits from disease prevented in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs to the healthcare payer versus the national economy. We discounted at 3.5% annually and monetised health impact at 20,000 per QALY to obtain the net monetary value, which we explored in sensitivity analyses. Findings Without vaccination and physical distancing, we estimated 147.9 million COVID-19 cases (95% uncertainty interval: 48.5 million, 198.7 million) and 2.8 million (770,000, 4.2 million) deaths in the UK over ten years. Vaccination with 75% vaccine effectiveness and 10-year protection may stop community transmission entirely for several years, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic without highly effective vaccines. Introducing vaccination compared to no vaccination leads to economic gains (positive net monetary value) of 0.37 billion to +1.33 billion across all physical distancing and vaccine effectiveness scenarios from the healthcare perspective, but net monetary values of physical distancing scenarios may be negative from societal perspective if the daily national economy losses are persistent and large. Interpretation Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

48,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 within the healthcare environment: a multicentre study conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in England,"Understanding how Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spread within the hospital setting is essential if staff are to be adequately protected, effective infection control measures are to be implemented and nosocomial transmission is to be prevented. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air and on environmental surfaces around hospitalised patients, with and without respiratory symptoms, was investigated. Environmental sampling was carried out within eight hospitals in England during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Samples were analysed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation assays. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 30 (8.9%) of 336 environmental surfaces. Ct values ranged from 28.8 to 39.1 equating to 2.2 x 105 to 59 genomic copies/swab. Concomitant bacterial counts were low, suggesting the cleaning performed by nursing and domestic staff across all eight hospitals was effective. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in four of 55 air samples taken < 1 m from four different patients. In all cases, the concentration of viral RNA was low and ranged from < 10 to 460 genomic copies per m3 of air. Infectious virus was not recovered from any of the PCR positive samples analysed. Effective cleaning can reduce the risk of fomite (contact) transmission but some surface types may facilitate the survival, persistence and/or dispersal of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of low or undetectable concentrations of viral RNA in the air supports current guidance on the use of specific PPE ensembles for aerosol and non-aerosol generating procedures.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

49,"Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with LamPORE, a high-throughput platform combining loop-mediated isothermal amplification and nanopore sequencing","LamPORE is a novel diagnostic platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that combines loop-mediated isothermal amplification with nanopore sequencing, which could potentially be used to analyse thousands of samples per day on a single instrument. We evaluated the performance of LamPORE against RT-PCR using RNA extracted from spiked respiratory samples and from stored nose and throat swabs collected at two UK hospitals. The limit of detection of LamPORE was 7-10 genome copies/microlitre of extracted RNA. This is above the limit achievable by RT-PCR but was not associated with a significant reduction of sensitivity in clinical samples. Positive clinical specimens came mostly from patients with acute symptomatic infection, and among these LamPORE had a diagnostic sensitivity of 99.1% (226/228 [95% CI 96.9-99.9%]). Among negative clinical specimens, including 153 with other respiratory pathogens detected, LamPORE had a diagnostic specificity of 99.6% (278/279 [98.0-100.0%]). Overall, 1.4% (7/514 [0.5-2.9]) of samples produced an indeterminate result on first testing, and repeat LamPORE testing on the same RNA extract had a reproducibility of 96.8% (478/494 [94.8-98.1]). This indicates that LamPORE has a similar performance to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients, and offers a promising approach to high-throughput testing.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

50,Epidemiological characterization of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and positivity in subsequent RT-PCR tests in the United Arab Emirates,"Background The COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases could be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the identified COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases are yet to be characterized. In this study, we characterized the first cohort of COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases reported in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE, according to symptomatic state, and identified factors associated with the symptomatic state. Also, the strength of association between the symptomatic state and testing positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds was examined and quantified. Method We analyzed data collected from the first cohort of the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the health authorities in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE between February 28 and April 08, 2020. Self-reported sociodemographic, working status, travel history, and chronic comorbidities of 1,249 COVID-19 cases were analyzed according to symptomatic state (symptomatic and asymptomatic). After the first RT-PCR confirmatory test, the results of three subsequent testing rounds were also analyzed. Results A total of 791 confirmed cases with a mean age of 35.6 years (range: 1-81 years) and information on the symptomatic state were analyzed. Nearly, 56.0% were asymptomatic cases. The most frequent two symptoms were fever (58.0%) and cough (41.0%). The mean age of symptomatic (36.3 year, 12.6SD) was significantly higher than that of asymptomatic cases (34.5 year, 12.7SD). Compared to non-working populations, working in public places (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.11-2.80), healthcare settings (aOR, 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01-4.31), or in the aviation and tourism sector (aOR, 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14-4.40), were independently associated with the symptomatic state. Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was also associated with symptomatic cases (aOR, 1.76, 5% CI: 1.03-3.01). Compared to asymptomatic, symptomatic COVID-19 cases had consistent odds of two or more of testing positive to COVID-19 in three subsequent testing rounds. Conclusions A substantial proportion of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Abu Dhabi Emirate was asymptomatic. Quarantine of asymptomatic cases along with prevention measures and raising awareness of populations working in high-risk settings is warranted. Further, follow up research is needed to understand viral clearance and clinical outcomes according to the symptomatic state of the COVID-19 cases.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

52,"Safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine candidate: interim results of a phase 1/2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be controlled by an efficacious vaccine. Multiple vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available. METHODS We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles (vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3; n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). RESULTS We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and 3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15 participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and 83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6 for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3, respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels. CONCLUSIONS The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine against COVID-19.

53,Review of clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of COVID-19 in children-Systematic review and Meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of various clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases were searched to include studies conducted between January 1, 2020, and July 15, 2020 which reported data about clinical characteristics and laboratory findings in laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Random effects meta-analysis using generalized linear mixed models was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: The most prevalent symptom of COVID-19 in children was 46.17% (95%CI 39.18-53.33%), followed by cough (40.15%, 95%CI 34.56-46.02%). Less common symptoms were found to be dyspnea, vomiting, nasal congestion/rhinorrhea, diarrhea, sore throat/pharyngeal congestion, headache, and fatigue. The prevalence of asymptomatic children was 17.19% (95%CI 11.02-25.82%). The most prevalent laboratory findings in COVID-19 children were elevated Creatinine Kinase (26.86%, 95%CI 16.15-41.19%) and neutropenia (25.76%, 95%CI 13.96-42.58%). These were followed by elevated LDH, thrombocytosis, lymphocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated D Dimer, Elevated CRP, elevated ESR, leukocytosis, elevated AST and leukopenia.

54,Suitability of Two Rapid Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Assays for Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Activity of Sera,"Purpose: Assessment of commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays for their capacity to provide reliable information on sera neutralizing activity is an emerging need. We evaluated the performance of two commercially-available lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIC) (Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test and the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV Ab test) in comparison with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization pseudotyped assay for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients, and investigate whether the intensity of the test band in LFIC associates with neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titers. Patients and Methods: Ninety sera were included from 51 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotyped neutralization assay (vesicular stomatitis virus coated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) was used. Test line intensity was scored using a 4-level scale (0 to 3+). Results: Overall sensitivity of LFIC assays was 91.1% for the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, 72.2% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, 85.6% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM and 92.2% for the NtAb assay. Sensitivity increased for all assays in sera collected beyond day 14 after symptoms onset (93.9%, 79.6%,93.9% and 93.9%, respectively). Reactivities equal to or more intense than the positive control line ([&ge;]2+) in the Wondfo assay had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 96.4% for high NtAb50 titers ([&ge;]1/160). Conclusions: Our findings support the use of LFIC assays evaluated herein, particularly the Wondfo test, for COVID-19 diagnosis.

55,Genetic mechanisms of critical illness in Covid-19,"The subset of patients who develop critical illness in Covid-19 have extensive inflammation affecting the lungs and are strikingly different from other patients: immunosuppressive therapy benefits critically-ill patients, but may harm some non-critical cases. Since susceptibility to life-threatening infections and immune-mediated diseases are both strongly heritable traits, we reasoned that host genetic variation may identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic development in Covid-19. GenOMICC (Genetics Of Mortality In Critical Care, genomicc.org) is a global collaborative study to understand the genetic basis of critical illness. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2790 critically-ill Covid-19 patients from 208 UK intensive care units (ICUs), representing >95% of all ICU beds. Random controls were drawn from three distinct UK population studies. We identify and replicate several novel genome-wide significant associations including variants chr19p13.3 (rs2109069, P = 3.98 x 10-12), within the gene encoding dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9), and at chr21q22.1 (rs2236757, P = 4.99 x 10-8) in the interferon receptor IFNAR2. Consistent with our focus on extreme disease in younger patients with less comorbidity, we detect a stronger signal at the known 3p21.31 locus than previous studies (rs73064425, P = 1.2 x 10-27). We identify potential targets for repurposing of existing licensed medications. Using Mendelian randomisation we found evidence in support of a causal link from low expression of IFNAR2, and high expression of TYK2, to life-threatening disease. Transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe Covid-19. We detected genome-wide significant gene-level associations for genes with central roles in viral restriction (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3). These results identify specific loci associated with life-threatening disease, and potential targets for host-directed therapies.

56,Implications of Monsoon Season & UVB Radiation for COVID-19 in India,"Background: India has recorded 66,333 deaths over 36 administrative regions placing India third in the world after the US and Brazil for COVID-19 deaths as of 2 September 2020. Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India are still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB, whilst further exploring, whether monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB in COVID-19 deaths in India. Methods: We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020 - 8 August 2020 (n=4005). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. Findings: After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that the monsoon season and a unit increase in UVI are separately associated with 12.8 percentage points and 2.0 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, the current monsoon season, that has been going on for two weeks, is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 59%, whereas a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a reduction in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths of 37%. However, the current monsoon season, also reduces the protective role of UVI by 16.3% [0.33 percentage points], plausibly due to lower UVB exposure. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of both the monsoon season and UVI in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we find evidence that monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI. The protective role of monsoon season is plausibly due to limited outdoor activities of people. Our study outlines the role of the monsoon season and UVB in COVID-19 in India and supports health-related policy decision making in India.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200576""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20200576,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True

From China the virus has spread to 188 countries and regions worldwide, reaching the Sahel region on the 2nd of March 2020. Since whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is very crucial to understand the spreading dynamics of the ongoing pandemic, but only limited sequence data is available from the Sahel region to date, we have focused our efforts on generating the first Malian sequencing data available. Screening of 217 Malian patient samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 38 positive isolates from which 21 whole genome sequences were generated.

Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed in ten CMW communities between June 21 and September 9, 2020. PCR positivity, infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive), and infection severity rate were also estimated. Associations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity were investigated using regression analyses. Results: Study included 4,970 CMWs who were mostly men (95.0%) and <40 years of age (71.5%). Seropositivity ranged from 54.9% (95% CI: 50.2-59.4%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean seropositivity across all communities was 66.1% (95% CI: 61.5-70.6%). PCR positivity ranged from 0.0% to 10.5% (95% CI: 7.4-14.8%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean PCR positivity was 3.9% (95% CI: 1.6-6.9%). Median cycle threshold (Ct) value was 34.0 (range: 15.8-37.4). The majority (79.5%) of PCR-positive individuals had Ct value >30 indicative of earlier rather than recent infection. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) ranged from 62.5% (95% CI: 58.3-66.7%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean infection positivity was 69.5% (95% CI: 62.8-75.9%). Only five infections were ever severe and one was ever critical, an infection severity rate of 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%). Conclusions: Based on an extended range of epidemiological measures, active infection is rare in these communities with limited if any sustainable infection transmission for clusters to occur. At least some CMW communities in Qatar have reached or nearly reached herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection at a proportion of ever infection of 65-70%.",Andrew Jeremijenko; Hiam Chemaitelly; Houssein H.

60,Quantifying the impact of quarantine duration on COVID-19 transmission,"The numbers of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection are increasing in many places. Consequently, the number of individuals placed into quarantine is increasing too. The large number of individuals in quarantine has high societal and economical costs, as well as infringing on the freedom of the individual. This has led to a vigorous debate about the duration of quarantine, particularly in light of the potentially low specificity of quarantine (i.e. low probability of quarantined individuals indeed being infected). We present a mathematical model that leverages empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how the duration of quarantine affects transmission. With this model we address the impact of shortening the quarantine for returning travellers and traced contacts of confirmed cases, both in terms of prevented transmission and the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine. We also consider the impact of i) test-and-release strategies; ii) additional hygiene measures imposed upon release after a negative test; iii) the development of symptoms during quarantine; iv) the relationship between quarantine duration and adherence; and v) the specificity of quarantine. When considering the benefit versus cost utility of quarantine, we find that the diminishing impact of longer quarantine on transmission prevention may support a quarantine duration below 10 days, particularly for returning travellers. A greater gain of utility can be achieved through a test-and-release strategy, and this can be even further strengthened by imposed hygiene measures post-release. We also find that unless a test-and-release strategy is considered, the specificity of quarantine does not affect the optimal duration of quarantine. Therefore, the argument that we should shorten quarantine because of lack of specificity is misguided.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201061""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.20201061,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,True
61,Impact of COVID-19 on the mortality rates for the resident population of the Umbria region in Italy,"The mortality figures related to the coronavirus pandemic has been the topic of debate lately. Several hypothesis are made regarding the expected number of deaths in a region but there are various factors governing the same. In this paper, we have discussed the mortality figures in the Umbria region after analyzing the data from the national Health registry between December 2019 to April 2020; the period of infection and its comparison with the data from previous five years. The factors governing these figures were studied including temperature, standard mortality rates, territorial distribution, death due to all cases as well as the non-COVID deaths. A sharp increase in mortality figures was observed for the month of march and low temperature also had a role to play. However the difference when compared to previous 5 years was not significant as was expected at the start of the study. A single factor cannot be responsible for the total mortality figures in a region as is frequently predicted.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson; Brendon  Y.

62,Identifying gaps in COVID-19 health equity data reporting in Canada using a scorecard approach,"Objective: To assess health equity-oriented COVID-19 data reporting across Canadian provinces and territories, using a scorecard approach. Method: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory-level, health regions, and local areas) (15 ""overall"" indicators), and for two vulnerable settings (long term care and detention facilities) and six social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, essential worker status, and income) (120 ""equity-related"" indicators). Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. Results: Overall, information on cases and deaths was more complete than for tests, hospitalizations and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 53%, ""B"") than for equity-related indicators (average score of 21%, ""D""). Only British Columbia and Alberta provided case-delimited data, and only Alberta provided information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' individual-level immigration status, race, or income. Only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for long-term care settings and detention facilities. Conclusion: Socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes is sparse in Canada. However, several best practices in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson; Brendon  Y.

63,On the Analysis of Mortality Risk Factors for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: a Data-driven Study Using the Major Brazilian Database,"Background: Brazil became the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in a brief period of a few months after the first officially registered case. The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. Methods: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe, 2020) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26 to August 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. Results: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the mortality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Heart disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with heart disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high mortality rate of around 50% was observed. The ICU admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson; Brendon  Y.

The airborne nature of the virus could be a threat in indoor spaces in general and in particular for in-class education. We provide an assessment of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 7-hour school day in elementary schools. We show that existing data are insufficient to establish a low (below 1\%) probability of infection with high accuracy.

66,What have we learned about positive changes experienced during COVID-19 lockdown? Evidence of the social patterning of change,"Background: Multiple studies have highlighted the negative impact of COVID-19 and its particular effects on vulnerable sub-populations. Complementing this work, here, we report on the social patterning of self-reported positive changes experienced during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. Methods: The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9-12 of a national lockdown. Participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. Results: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health. Conclusion: Overall our results highlight the social patterning of positive changes during lockdown in Scotland. These findings begin to illuminate the complexity of the unanticipated effects of national lockdown and will be used to support future intervention development work sharing lessons learned from lockdown to increase positive health change amongst those who may benefit.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson; Brendon  Y.

Increasing infection rates in health professionals can lead to the collapse of the health system and further worsen the pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of IgM and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 in health workers in Sergipe, Brazil. Methods: The targeted tests involved health professionals working on the front line to combat COVID-19. The samples were collected in the month of June, in six hospital units in the state of Sergipe. Results: 471 health professionals were tested. Of these, 28 workers (5.95%) tested positive for IgM and 64 (13.59%) tested positive for IgG. 9 workers (1.91%) tested positive for IgM and were also positive for IgG. Discussion: Health workers must be monitored constantly, because if they are infected, they can spread the virus to colleagues, hospitalized patients and even family members. Conclusion: Knowing the prevalence of antibodies to the virus in health workers is an important measure of viral spread control.

68,"A low-cost, rapidly scalable, emergency use ventilator for the COVID-19 crisis","For the past 50 years, positive pressure ventilation has been a cornerstone of treatment for respiratory failure. Consensus surrounding the epidemiology of respiratory failure has permitted a relatively good fit between the supply of ventilators and the demand. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for mechanical ventilators well beyond supply. Respiratory failure complicates most critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is characterized by highly heterogeneous pulmonary parenchymal involvement, profound hypoxemia and pulmonary vascular injury. The profound increase in the incidence of respiratory failure has exposed critical shortages in the supply of mechanical ventilators, and those with the necessary skills to treat. While most traditional ventilators rely on an internal compressor and mixer to moderate and control the gas mixture delivered to a patient, the current emergency climate has catalyzed alternative designs that might enable greater flexibility in terms of supply chain, manufacturing, storage and maintenance. Design considerations of these 'emergency response' ventilators have generally fallen into two categories: those that rely on mechanical compression of a known volume of gas and those powered by an internal compressor to deliver time cycled pressure- or volume-limited gas to the patient. The present work introduces a low-cost, ventilator designed and built in accordance with the Emergence Use guidance provided by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wherein an external gas supply feeds into the ventilator and time limited flow interruption guarantees tidal volume. The goal of this device is to allow a patient to be treated by a single ventilator platform, capable of supporting the various treatment paradigms during a potential COVID-19 related hospitalization. This is a unique aspect of this design as it attempts to become a one-device-one-visit solution to the problem. The device is designed as a single use ventilator that is sufficiently robust to treat a patient being mechanically ventilated. The overall design philosophy and its applicability in this new crisis-laden world view is first described, followed by both bench top and animal testing results used to confirm the precision, capability, safety and reliability of this low cost and novel approach to mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ventilator is shown to perform in a range of critical requirements listed in the FDA emergency regulations and can safely and effectively ventilate a porcine subject. As of August 2020, only 13 emergency ventilators have been authorized by the FDA, and this work represents the first to publish animal data using the ventilator. This proof-of-concept provides support for this cost-effective, readily mass-produced ventilator that can be used to support patients when the demand for ventilators outstrips supply in hospital settings worldwide.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. This study aims to understand the perception of the public towards hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in August 2020 across the 36 states of Nigeria using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. The results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.87%). Most of the respondents (385, 74.47%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance is unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.12%), followed by the belief that their immune system is sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.27%). There are significant association with the respondents age and having reservations toward vaccination [{chi}2= 19.0389 P-value=0.00] and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance [{chi}2=24.3316 P-value=0.00]. Furthermore, geographical location and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine [{chi}2=13.7786 P-value=0.02] are significantly associated.

We partially account for behavioral responses using Google mobility data. Our identification approach exploits variation in the timing of indoor face mask mandates staggered over two months in the 34 public health regions in Ontario, Canada's most populous province. We find that, in the first few weeks after implementation, mask mandates are associated with a reduction of 25 percent in the weekly number of new COVID-19 cases. Additional analysis with province-level data provides corroborating evidence. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest that mandating indoor masks nationwide in early July could have reduced the weekly number of new cases in Canada by 25 to 40 percent in mid-August, which translates into 700 to 1,100 fewer cases per week.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson; Brendon  Y.

71,Personal protective equipment for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers involved in emergency trauma surgery during the pandemic: an umbrella review,"Objective: The objective of this review was to summarise the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery. The purpose of the review was to inform recommendations for rational use of PPE for emergency surgery staff, particularly in low resources environments where PPE shortages and high costs are expected to hamper the safety of healthcare workers (HCWs) and affect the care of trauma patients. Introduction: Many healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers from viral exposure. Inclusion criteria: This review included systematic reviews, experimental and observational studies evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in HCWs involved in emergency trauma surgery. Indirect evidence from other healthcare settings was considered, as well as evidence from other viral outbreaks summarised and discussed for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and over thirty other sources. The risk of bias assessment of the included studies was planned with the AMSTAR II tool for systematic reviews, the RoBII tool for randomised controlled trials, and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised studies. Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction tool and summarised narratively. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for grading the certainty of the evidence was followed. Results: We identified 17 systematic reviews that fulfilled our selection criteria and were included for synthesis. We did not identify randomised controlled trials during COVID-19 or studies additional to those included in the reviews that discussed other similar viral respiratory illnesses. Conclusions: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in HCWs in the hospital setting. N95 and N95 equivalent respirators provided more protection and were found to halve the risk of COVID-19 contagion in HCWs from moderate and high-risk environments. Eye protection also offers additional security and is associated with reduced incidence of contagion. These effects apply to emergency trauma care. Decontamination and reuse appear as feasible, cost-effective measures that would likely help overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks are associated with a reduced risk of coronaviruses respiratory illness when compared with no mask use. In moderate to high-risk environments, especially in aerosol-generating procedures, N95 respirators are associated with a more significant reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson; Brendon  Y.

The objective of this study was to determine the health facility (HF) preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak from the perspective of RMNH providers and to determine what factors significantly predict this. An anonymous cross-sectional online survey of RMNH providers was conducted from 1st to 21st July 2020 in Lagos state Nigeria. We conducted a descriptive and ordinal regression analysis, with RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak as the dependent variable. Two hundred and fifty-six RMNH workers participated, 35.2% reported that RMNH services were unavailable at some time since March 2020, 39% felt moderate or extreme work-related burnout, 84% were moderately or extremely concerned about the availability of PPE and related guidelines, and only 11.7% were extremely satisfied with the preparedness of their HFs. Our final model was a statistically significant predictor of RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness explaining 54.7% of the variation in the outcome variable. A one-unit increase in the level of satisfaction with the communication from HF management and level of concern about the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines would increase the odds of observing a higher category of satisfaction with HF COVID-19 preparedness (OR 0.79-2.92, p<0.001 and 0.02-0.15 p<0.001 respectively).

73,COVID-19 mortality rate in Russia: forecasts and reality evaluation,"COVID-19 is an extremely dangerous disease that not only spreads quickly, but is also characterized by a high mortality rate. Therefore, predicting the number of deaths from the new coronavirus is an urgent task. The aim of the study is to analyze the factors affecting COVID-19 mortality rate in various countries, to predict direct and indirect victims of the pandemic in the Russian Federation, and to estimate additional mortality during the pandemic based on the demographic data. The main research method is econometric modeling. Comparison of various data was also applied. The authors' calculations were based on data from the RSSS, the World Bank, as well as specialized sites with coronavirus statistics in Russia and in the world. A predictive estimation of the deceased number of people due to the pandemic in Russia was made. It is confirmed that the deaths proportion of the completed cases of the disease depends on the level of testing. It is shown that the revealed mortality of the disease depends on the proportion of completed cases, on the population age structure, and on how early the pandemic entered the country compared to the other countries. It is determined that the number of additional deaths due to the coronavirus is approximately 31 thousand people. The analysis revealed that the relatively low proportion of COVID in Russia is the result of a special approach to the cause of death determination. The mortality rate in Russia in April 2020 was about 3% higher than in April 2019. The share of the deceased health workers in the total coronavirus mortality in the Russian Federation is higher than in the developed countries, which indicates an underestimation of the data on COVID- 19 deaths in the Russian Federation, and the unsatisfactory quality of the Russian healthcare system.

75,Performance of a point of care test for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and seroprevalence in blood donors and health care workers in Panama,"Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has reached 28 million cases worldwide in eight months. The serological detection of antibodies against the virus will play a pivotal role in complementing molecular tests to improve diagnostic accuracy, contact tracing, vaccine efficacy testing and seroprevalence surveillance. Here, we aimed first to evaluate a lateral flow assay ability to identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and second, to report the seroprevalence of these antibodies among health care workers and healthy volunteer blood donors in Panama. We recruited study participants between April 30th and July 7th, 2020. For the test validation and performance evaluation, we analyzed serum samples from participants with clinical symptoms and confirmed positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, participants with other confirmed infectious diseases, and a set of pre-pandemic serum samples. We used two by two table analysis to determine the test sensitivity and specificity as well as the kappa agreement value with a 95% confidence interval. Then, we used the lateral flow assay to determine seroprevalence among serum samples from COVID-19 patients, potentially exposed health care workers, and healthy volunteer donors. Our results show this assay reached a positive percent agreement of 97.2% (95% CI 84.2-100.0%) for detecting both IgM and IgG. The assay showed a kappa of 0.898 (95%CI 0.811- 0.985) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.839-0.997) for IgM and IgG, respectively. The evaluation of serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicates a correlation between test sensitivity and the number of days since symptom onset; the highest positive percent agreement (87% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%)) was observed at [&ge;]15 days post-symptom onset. We found an overall antibody seroprevalence of 11.6% (95% CI 8.5-15.8%) among both health care workers and healthy blood donors. Our findings suggest this lateral flow assay could contribute significantly to implementing seroprevalence testing in locations with active community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson; Brendon  Y.

We report an aptamer-based SARS-CoV-2 salivary antigen assay employing only low-cost reagents ($3.20/test) and an off-the-shelf glucometer. The test was engineered around a glucometer as it is quantitative, easy to use, and the most prevalent piece of diagnostic equipment globally making the test highly scalable with an infrastructure that is already in place. Furthermore, many glucometers connect to smartphones providing an opportunity to integrate with contract tracing apps, medical providers, and electronic medical records. In clinical testing, the developed assay detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient saliva across a range of viral loads - as benchmarked by RT-qPCR - within one hour, with 100% sensitivity (positive percent agreement) and distinguished infected specimens from off-target antigens in uninfected controls with 100% specificity (negative percent agreement).

Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, complications, laboratory results, and clinical management of the patients were studied from data obtained from 168 individuals diagnosed with an advanced prognosis of COVID-19 admitted in two hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: Individuals in the study sample contracted COVID-19 through community transmission. 56.5% (n = 95) cases died in intensive care units (ICU) during the study period. The median age was 56 years and 79.2% (n=134) were male. Typical clinical manifestation included Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related complications (79.2%), fever (54.2%) and cough (25.6%) while diabetes mellitus (52.4%), hypertension (41.1%) and heart diseases (16.7%) were the conventional comorbidities. Clinical outcomes were detrimental due to comorbidities rather than age and comorbid individuals over 50 were at more risk. In the sample, oxygen saturation was low (< 95% SpO2) in 135 patients (80.4%) and 158 (93.4%) patients received supplemental oxygen. Identical biochemical parameters were found in both deceased and surviving cases. Administration of antiviral drug Remdesivir and the glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone increased the proportion of surviving patients slightly.

79,Poor inhibitory control and stress as risk-factors for alcohol (mis)use during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a national cross-sectional study across four generations,"Background: The impact COVID-19 on the UK population's alcohol intake is unknown. We assessed change in alcohol-use and hazardous drinking during the first lockdown, and tested the hypothesis that variation would be predicted by stress and inhibitory-control. Methods: We interrogated cross-sectional data from the first sweep of the COVID-19 longitudinal survey, comprising 4 national cohorts (13 453 respondents, 19-62 years). Respondents self-reported their alcohol use, stress, and inhibitory control. We regressed change in drinking and alcohol misuse on stress and inhibitory control, adjusting for covariates to account for demographics. Findings: 29.08% 30-year-olds increased alcohol use post-COVID-19. Stress was a major contributing factor to increased alcohol use in 30-year olds (adjusted OR 3.92, 95% CI 1.17 - 13.15), as was inhibitory control in 19-year-olds (adjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.23), 30-year-olds (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.33) and 50-year-olds (adjusted OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.12). We identified several interactions between stress and inhibitory control in all age groups, suggesting a complex age-specific relationship between the risk factors and alcohol use and misuse during the pandemic. Interpretation: In the UK, alcohol use increased in up to 30% of the population during COVID-19, resulting from a combination of factors including poor inhibitory control and stress. It is critical in future lockdowns that clinicians and public health officials are aware of the challenges faced by different age groups, and prioritise and personalise interventions and prevention measures appropriately.

Methods: We conducted a world-wide mobile application-based prospective cohort study available to English speaking adults with a smartphone. We collected self-reported characteristics, exposures, and behaviors, as well as smartphone-based geolocation data. Our main outcome was incident symptoms of viral infection, defined as fevers and chills plus one other symptom previously shown to occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by daily surveys. Findings: Among 14, 335 participants residing in all 50 US states and 93 different countries followed for a median 21 days (IQR 10-26 days), 424 (3%) developed incident viral symptoms. In pooled multivariable logistic regression models, female biological sex (odds ration [OR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.39-2.20, p<0.001), anemia (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.16-1.81, p=0.001), hypertension (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.68, p=0.007), cigarette smoking in the last 30 days (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.35-2.55, p<0.001), any viral symptoms among household members 6-12 days prior (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.67-2.55, p<0.001), and the maximum number of individuals the participant interacted with within 6 feet in the past 6-12 days (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.25, p<0.001) were each associated with a higher risk of developing viral symptoms. Conversely, a higher subjective social status (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, p<0.001), at least weekly exercise (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47-0.70, p<0.001), and sanitizing one's phone (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99, p=0.037) were each associated with a lower risk of developing viral symptoms.

Due to limited availability of testing, only a non-random subset of the population can get tested. Hence, the reported test counts are subject to a large degree of selection bias. We consider an extension of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model under both selection bias and misclassification. We derive closed form expression for the basic reproduction number under such data anomalies using the next generation matrix method. We conduct extensive simulation studies to quantify the effect of misclassification and selection on the resultant estimation and prediction of future case counts. Finally we apply the methods to reported case-death-recovery count data from India, a nation with more than 5 million cases reported over the last seven months. We show that correcting for misclassification and selection can lead to more accurate prediction of case-counts (and death counts) using the observed data as a beta tester. The model also provides an estimate of undetected infections and thus an under-reporting factor. For India, the estimated under-reporting factor for cases is around 21 and for deaths is around 6.

However, there is very little research on the behaviours and behavioural barriers involved in getting tested, both in Australia and worldwide, despite there being some evidence that these barriers do exist. Methods: The Sydney Health Literacy Lab (SHeLL) has been conducting a national longitudinal survey in Australia since April 2020. A list of testing barriers was included in Wave 3 in June 2020 (n=1369), along with intentions to test and self-isolate if symptomatic. Open responses were also collected. The test barriers identified were categorised using the COM-B framework. Results: Only 49% of people strongly agreed they would get tested if they had COVID-19 symptoms, but most people agreed to some extent that they would get tested (96%). The most common barriers selected from the list provided were that testing is painful (11%), not knowing how to get tested (7%), and worry about getting infected at the testing centre (5%). Many participants (10%) indicated other reasons, and open responses included many additional barriers to testing than those provided in the initial list. These covered all components of the COM-B model.

84,Psychological preparedness for pandemic (COVID-19) management: Perceptions of nurses and nursing students in India,"Introduction: The growing COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great threat to millions of people worldwide. Nurses and nursing students are an important group of health professionals who are most likely to face many challenges in this unprecedented scenario. The present study aimed at exploring the perception of nurses and nursing students regarding psychological preparedness for the pandemic (COVID-19) management. Materials & Methods: The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional online survey research design. Purposive sampling was used with an attempt to represent the entire nurses (i.e. nursing officers, nurse administrators and nursing teachers) and nursing students group of India. The survey link was shared to their email ID and they were invited to participate in the study. Data were collected using Psychological Preparedness for Disaster Threat Scale (PPDTS)-Modified, General Self Efficacy (GSE) Scale, Optimism Scale and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRS). Totally 685 responses were received and 676 forms were completed which were analyzed using SPSS software (version 24). Results: The mean age of the subjects was 31.72 (SD=9.58) years. Around 20% of the subjects previously had some kind of psychological training and 4% of the subjects had taken care of persons with COVID-19. Findings revealed that mean score for PPDTS, GSE, BRCS and Optimism was 73.44 (SD=10.82, 33.19 (SD=5.23), 16.79 (SD=2.73) and 9.61 (SD=2.26) respectively indicating that the subjects had moderate level of psychological preparedness, self-efficacy and resilience but higher level of optimism. Psychological preparedness, self-efficacy, optimism and resilience were positively correlated to each other. Self- efficacy, optimism, and resilience emerged as predictors of psychological preparedness. Conclusion: The findings suggested that self-efficacy, optimism and resilience can be considered as predictors for psychological preparedness in pandemic management.

85,Outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral clades in COVID-19,"Background The COVID-19 epidemic of 2019-20 is due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Following first case description in December, 2019 this virus has infected over 10 million individuals and resulted in at least 500,000 deaths world-wide. The virus is undergoing rapid mutation, with two major clades of sequence variants emerging. This study sought to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants are associated with differing outcomes among COVID-19 patients in a single medical system. Methods Whole genome SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was obtained from isolates collected from patients registered in the University of Washington Medicine health system between March 1 and April 15, 2020. Demographic and baseline medical data along with outcomes of hospitalization and death were collected. Statistical and machine learning models were applied to determine if viral genetic variants were associated with specific outcomes of hospitalization or death. Findings Full length SARS-CoV-2 sequence was obtained 190 subjects with clinical outcome data. 35 (18.4%) were hospitalized and 14 (7.4%) died from complications of infection. A total of 289 single nucleotide variants were identified. Clustering methods demonstrated two major viral clades, which could be readily distinguished by 12 polymorphisms in 5 genes. A trend toward higher rates of hospitalization of patients with Clade 2 was observed (p=0.06). Machine learning models utilizing patient demographics and co-morbidities achieved area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.93 for predicting hospitalization. Addition of viral clade or sequence information did not significantly improve models for outcome prediction. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 shows substantial sequence diversity in a community-based sample. Two dominant clades of virus are in circulation. Among patients sufficiently ill to warrant testing for virus, no significant difference in outcomes of hospitalization or death could be discerned between clades in this sample.

87,A high-affinity RBD-targeting nanobody improves fusion partner's potency against SARS-CoV-2,"A key step to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the attachment of its Spike receptor-binding domain (S RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. Considerable research have been devoted to the development of neutralizing antibodies, including llama-derived single-chain nanobodies, to target the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and to block ACE2-RBD binding. Simple and effective strategies to increase potency are desirable for such studies when antibodies are only modestly effective. Here, we identify and characterize a high-affinity synthetic nanobody (sybody, SR31) as a fusion partner to improve the potency of RBM-antibodies. Crystallographic studies reveal that SR31 binds to RBD at a conserved and  greasy site distal to RBM. Although SR31 distorts RBD at the interface, it does not perturb the RBM conformation, hence displaying no neutralizing activities itself. However, fusing SR31 to two modestly neutralizing sybodies dramatically increases their affinity for RBD and neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Our work presents a tool protein and an efficient strategy to improve nanobody potency.",Pamela C Proud; Daphne Tsitoura; Robert J Watson; Brendon  Y.

88,Sequence Analysis for SNP Detection and Phylogenetic Reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 Isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 Cases,"BackgroundCoronaviruses are a group of viruses that belong to the Family Coronaviridae, Genus Betacoronavirus. In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) characterized by severe respiratory symptoms was discovered. The causative pathogen was a novel coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV and later as SARS-CoV-2. Within two months of its discovery, COVID-19 became a pandemic causing widespread morbidity and mortality.

MethodologyWhole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 cases were retrieved by downloading from GISAID database. A total of 18 sequences that satisfied quality assurance (length [&ge;] 29700 nts and number of unknown bases denoted as  N [&le;] 5%) were used for the study. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was done in MAFFT (Version 7.471) while SNP calling was implemented in DnaSP (Version 6.12.03) respectively and then visualized in Jalview (Version 2.11.1.0). Phylogenetic analysis was with MEGA X software.

ResultsNigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% genomic similarity with four large conserved genomic regions. A total of 66 SNPs were identified out of which 31 were informative. Nucleotide diversity assessment gave Pi = 0.00048 and average SNP frequency of 2.22 SNPs per 1000 nts. Non-coding genomic regions particularly 5UTR and 3UTR had a SNP density of 3.77 and 35.4 respectively. The region with the highest SNP density was ORF10 with a frequency of 8.55 SNPs/1000 nts). Majority (72.2%) of viruses in Nigeria are of L lineage with preponderance of D614G mutation which accounted for 11 (61.1%) out of the 18 viral sequences. Nigeria SARS-CoV-2 revealed 3 major clades namely Oyo, Ekiti and Osun on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.

Conclusion and RecommendationNigerian SARS-CoV-2 reveals high mutation rate together with preponderance of L lineage and D614G mutants. Implication of these mutations for SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the need for more aggressive testing and treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria is discussed. Additionally, attempt to produce testing kits for COVID-19 in Nigeria should consider the conserved regions identified in this study.

89,Prophylactic intranasal administration of a TLR2 agonist reduces upper respiratory tract viral shedding in a SARS-CoV-2 challenge ferret model,"Respiratory viruses such as coronaviruses represent major ongoing global threats, causing epidemics and pandemics with huge economic burden. Rapid spread of virus through populations poses an enormous challenge for outbreak control. Like all respiratory viruses, the most recent novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, initiates infection in the upper respiratory tract (URT). Infected individuals are often asymptomatic, yet highly infectious and readily transmit virus. A therapy that restricts initial replication in the URT has the potential to prevent progression of severe lower respiratory tract disease as well as limiting person-to-person transmission.

We show that prophylactic intra-nasal administration of the TLR2/6 agonist INNA-051 in a SARS-CoV-2 ferret infection model effectively reduces levels of viral RNA in the nose and throat.

90,SARS-CoV-2 induces double-stranded RNA-mediated innate immune responses in respiratory epithelial derived cells and cardiomyocytes,"Coronaviruses are adept at evading and/or antagonizing double-stranded RNA-induced host antiviral pathways, including interferon signaling, OAS-RNase L and PKR while robust cytokine responses characterize severe coronavirus disease. Knowledge of how newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 interacts with these pathways is minimal. SARS-CoV-2 readily infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells(iAT2) and cardiomyocytes(iCM). Robust activation of interferons or RNase L is not observed, while PKR activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 and A549ACE2 lung derived cell lines, activation of all pathways is observed, similar to a mutant MERS-CoV lacking innate immune antagonists. Moreover, increased replication in RNASEL knockout A549ACE2 cells, implicates RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 is less adept at antagonizing these host defense pathways compared to other coronaviruses, the innate immune response is still generally weak. These host-virus interactions may contribute to the unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski; Simone Hauck; Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito; Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia; Agustin Perez-Garcia; Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop; Zhen Cui; Qing Ye; Geng Chen; Kui-Kui Lu; Yin Chen; Yu-Tao Chen; Hong-Xing Pan; Bao-Li Zhu,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312553""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312553,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,False
91,Cyclooxgenase-2 is induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection but does not affect viral entry or replication,"Identifying drugs that regulate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its symptoms has been a pressing area of investigation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). PGE2, one of the most abundant PGs, has diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Previous studies have shown that NSAID treatment or inhibition of PGE2 receptor signaling leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, thus raising concerns that NSAIDs could increase susceptibility to infection. COX/PGE2 signaling has also been shown to regulate the replication of many viruses, but it is not yet known whether it plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this study was to dissect the effect of NSAIDs on COVID-19 in terms of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2 upregulation in diverse human cell culture and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2/PGE2 signaling by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication. Our findings suggest that COX-2 signaling driven by SARS-CoV-2 may instead play a role in regulating the lung inflammation and injury observed in COVID-19 patients.

ImportancePublic health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NSAIDs function by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These enzymes are critical for the generation of prostaglandins, lipid molecules with diverse roles in maintaining homeostasis as well as regulating the inflammatory response. While COX-1/COX-2 signaling pathways have been shown to affect the replication of many viruses, their effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2 expression in both human cell culture systems and mouse models. However, inhibition of COX-2 activity with NSAIDs did not affect SARS-CoV-2 entry or replication. Our findings suggest that COX-2 signaling may instead regulate the lung inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients, which is an important area for future studies.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312769""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312769,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,False
92,A potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human monoclonal antibody that reduces viral burden and disease severity in Syrian hamsters,"The emergence of COVID-19 has led to a pandemic that has caused millions of cases of disease, variable morbidity and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Currently, only remdesivir and dexamethasone have demonstrated limited efficacy, only slightly reducing disease burden, thus novel approaches for clinical management of COVID-19 are needed. We identified a panel of human monoclonal antibody clones from a yeast display library with specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain that neutralized the virus in vitro. Administration of the lead antibody clone to Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced viral load and histopathology score in the lungs. Moreover, the antibody interrupted monocyte infiltration into the lungs, which may have contributed to the reduction of disease severity by limiting immunopathological exacerbation. The use of this antibody could provide an important therapy for treatment of COVID-19 patients.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski; Simone Hauck; Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito; Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia; Agustin Perez-Garcia; Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop; Zhen Cui; Qing Ye; Geng Chen; Kui-Kui Lu; Yin Chen; Yu-Tao Chen; Hong-Xing Pan,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313601""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313601,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,False
93,Nitazoxanide and JIB-04 have broad-spectrum antiviral activity and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture and coronavirus pathogenesis in a pig model,"Pathogenic coronaviruses represent a major threat to global public health. Here, using a recombinant reporter virus-based compound screening approach, we identified several small-molecule inhibitors that potently block the replication of the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two compounds, nitazoxanide and JIB-04 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of 4.90 M and 0.69 M, respectively, with specificity indices of greater than 150. Both inhibitors had in vitro antiviral activity in multiple cell types against some DNA and RNA viruses, including porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. In an in vivo porcine model of coronavirus infection, administration of JIB-04 reduced virus infection and associated tissue pathology, which resulted in improved body weight gain and survival.

Seven such in vitro studies were selected for comparative bioinformatic analysis through the VirOmics Playground, a user-friendly visualisation and exploration platform we recently developed. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the data sets, several commonalities could be observed across studies and species.

95,"SARS-CoV-2 and Malayan pangolin coronavirus infect human endoderm, ectoderm and induced lung progenitor cells","Since the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in several somatic cells, little is known about the infection of SASRS-CoV-2 and its related pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V). Here we present for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm cells causing these cells death, which differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V were inhibited when treated with whey protein of breastmilk and Remdesivir, confirming that these two viruses could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect endoderm and ectoderm. We found that whey protein blocked SARS-CoV-2 infecting these cells. In line with the SARS-CoV-2 results, GX_P2V could also infected endoderm and ectoderm, and also was inhibited by Remdesivir treatment. Although expressing coronavirus related receptor such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, mesoderm cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, which needed further to study the mechanisms. Interestingly, we also found that hESCs, which also express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 markers, are permissive for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and replication, indicating the widespread cell types for GX_P2V infection. Heparin treatment blocked efficiently viral infection. These results provided insight that these stem cells maybe provided a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome. The potential consequence of SARS-CoV-2 and animal coronavirus such as GX_P2V infection in hESCs, germ layer and induced progenitors should be closely monitored.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski; Simone Hauck; Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito; Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia; Agustin Perez-Garcia,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313270""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.313270,2020-09-25,2020-09-25,,False
96,Risk factors for mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"Objectives To develop a prognostic model to identify and quantify risk factors for mortality among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. Design Retrospective cohort study. Patients were randomly assigned to either training (80%) or test (20%) sets. The training set was used to fit a multivariable logistic regression. Predictors were ranked using variable importance metrics. Models were assessed by C-indices, Brier scores, and calibration plots in the test set. Setting Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset. Participants 17,086 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between February 20, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Main outcome measure All-cause mortality during hospital stay. Results The full model that included information on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results and vital signs had good discrimination (C-index = 0.87) and was well calibrated, with some overpredictions for the most at-risk patients. Results were generally similar on the training and test sets, suggesting that there was little overfitting. Age was the most important risk factor. The performance of models that included all demographics and comorbidities (C-index = 0.79) was only slightly better than a model that only included age (C-index = 0.76). Across the study period, predicted mortality was 1.2% for 18-year olds, 8.4% for 55-year olds, and 28.6% for 85-year olds. Predicted mortality across all ages declined over the study period from 21.7% by March to 13.3% by May. Conclusion Age was the most important predictor of all-cause mortality although vital signs and laboratory results added considerable prognostic information with oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and white blood cell count being among the most important predictors. Demographic and comorbidity factors did not improve model performance appreciably. The model had good discrimination and was reasonably well calibrated, suggesting that it may be useful for assessment of prognosis.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski; Simone Hauck,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20196204""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20196204,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,True
97,Prospective comparison of saliva and nasopharyngeal swab sampling for mass screening for COVID-19,"Current testing for COVID-19 relies on quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Saliva samples have advantages regarding ease and painlessness of collection, which does not require trained staff and may allow self-sampling. We enrolled 776 persons at various field-testing sites and collected nasopharyngeal and pooled saliva samples. 162 had a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR, 61% were mildly symptomatic and 39% asymptomatic. The sensitivity of RT-PCR on saliva samples versus nasopharygeal swabs varied depending on the patient groups considered or on Ct thresholds. There were 10 (6.2%) patients with a positive saliva sample and a negative nasopharyngeal swab, all of whom had Ct values<25. For symptomatic patients for whom the interval between symptoms onset and sampling was <10 days sensitivity was 77% but when excluding persons with isolated Ngen positivity (54/162), sensitivity was 90%. In asymptomatic patients, the sensitivity was only 24%. When we looked at patients with Cts <30, sensitivity was 83% or 88.9% when considering 2 genes. The relatively good performance for patients with low Cts suggests that Saliva testing could be a useful and acceptable tool to identify infectious persons in mass screening contexts, a strategically important task for contact tracing and isolation in the community.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20150961""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20150961,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,True
98,Epidemiological measures for informing the general public during the SARS-CoV-2-outbreak: simulation study about bias by incomplete case-detection,"During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, several epidemiological measures, such as cumulative case-counts, incidence rates, effective reproduction numbers and doubling times, have been used to inform the general public and to justify interventions such as lockdown. During the course of the epidemic, it has been very likely that not all infectious people have been identified, which lead to incomplete case-detection. Apart from asymptomatic infections, possible reasons for incomplete case-detection are availability of test kits and changes in test policies during the course of the epidemic. So far, it has not been examined how biased the reported epidemiological measures are in the presence of incomplete case detection. In this work, we assess the four frequently used measures with respect to incomplete case-detection: 1) cumulative case-count, 2) incidence rate, 3) effective reproduction number and 4) doubling time. We apply an age-structured SIR model to simulate a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak followed by a lockdown in a hypothetical population. Different scenarios about temporal variations in case-detection are applied to the four measures during outbreak and lockdown. The biases resulting from incomplete case-detection on the four measures are compared. It turns out that the most frequently used epidemiological measure, the cumulative case count is most prone to bias in all of our settings. The effective reproduction number is the least biased measure. With a view to future reporting about this or other epidemics, we recommend to use of the effective reproduction number for informing the general public and policy makers.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20200089""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.20200089,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,True

We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death; and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users or famotidine non-users separately. Methods: We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. Study population were COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing one of the three drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine non-user group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient prior to or on the day of admission. Time-at-risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score (PS) model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model. Results: We identified 2193 users of PPI, 5950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1816 users of famotidine and 26,820 non-famotidine users. After PS stratification, the hazard ratios for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18); vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39); vs hydroxychloroquine:1.03 (0.85-1.24).

Then, this study aimed to model and forecast of COVID-19 new cases in these top 10 infected African countries. Methods: In this study, the COVID 19 new cases data have been modeled and forecasted using curve estimation regression and time series models for these top 10 infected African countries from Feb 14 to Sep 6, 2020. Results: From July to August, the prevalence of COVID-19 cumulative cases was declined in South Africa, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Cameron, Nigeria, and Algeria by 31%, 26%, 22%, 20%, 14%, 12%, and 4%, respectively. But, it was highly raised in Ethiopia and Morocco by 41%, and 38% in this period, respectively. In Kenya, it was raised only by 1%. In this study, the cubic regression models for the ln(COVID-19 new cases) data were relatively the best fit for Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa. And, the quadratic regression models for the data were the best fit for Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire and Ghana. The Algeria data was followed the logarithmic regression model. In the time series analysis, the Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa COVID-19 new cases data have fitted the ARIMA (0,1,0), ARIMA (0,1,0), and ARIMA (0,1,14) models, respectively. The Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire, Ghana, and Nigeria data have fitted the simple exponential smoothing models. The Ethiopia, Kenya, and Morocco data have followed the Damped trend, Holt, and Brown exponential smoothing models, respectively. In the analysis, the trends of COVID-19 new cases will be declined for Algeria and Ethiopia, and the trends will be constantan for Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire, Ghana and Nigeria. But, it will be raised slightly for Egypt and Kenya, and significantly for Morocco and South Africa from September 7 to October 6, 2020. Conclusion: This study was conducted with the current measures; the forecasts and trends obtained may differ from the number of cases that occur in the future. Thus, the study finding should be useful in preparedness planning against further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in African countries. And, the researcher recommended that as many countries continue to relax restrictions on movement and mass gatherings, and more are opening their airspaces, and the countries other public and private sectors are reopening.

However, there is a dearth of report on the description of the clinical characteristics of the disease in patients from Nigeria. This study was designed to provide a description of the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Methods: This study is a case series that includes patients that are evaluated between June and August 30, 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient health records were reviewed and evaluated to describe the clinical characteristics on presentation. Results: A total of 154 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, with a mean age (S.D.) of 46.16 (13.701). Most of the patients survived (mortality rate of 2.6%), and were symptomatic (89.6%). There were more males (74.7%) than females, and the most common symptoms were fever, breathing difficulty, dry cough and malaise. Co-morbidities were also present in almost half of the study participants (49.4%). Conclusion: This study presents the most extensive description, to date, on the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Males are more likely than females to be infected with COVID-19 and the most occurring symptoms are fever, breathing difficulty, malaise, dry cough and chest pain.

103,Modelling optimal vaccination strategy for SARS-CoV-2.,"The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted our vulnerability to novel infections. Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission- successfully reducing the reproductive number, R, below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial second wave. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and can avoid a second wave if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20194183""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20194183,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,True
104,Role of IgG against N-protein of SARS-CoV2 in COVID19 clinical outcomes,"The Nucleocapsid Protein (N Protein) of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is located in the viral core. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting N protein is detectable in the serum of infected patients. The effect of high titers of IgG against N-protein on clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV2 disease has not been described. We studied 400 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients to determine independent factors associated with poor outcomes, including MICU admission, prolonged MICU stay and hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality. We also measured serum IgG against the N protein and correlated its concentrations with clinical outcomes. We found that several factors, including Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI), high levels of IL6, and presentation with dyspnea were associated with poor clinical outcomes. It was shown that higher CCI and higher IL6 levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Anti-N protein IgG was detected in the serum of 55 (55%) patients at the time of admission. A high concentration of antibodies, defined as signal to cut off ratio (S/Co)> 1.5 (75 percentile of all measurements), was found in 25 (25%) patients. The multivariable logistic regression models showed that between being an African American, higher CCI, lymphocyte counts, and S/Co ratio> 1.5, only S/Co ratio were independently associated with MICU admission and longer length of stay in hospital.

COVID-19 CG provides significant time, labor, and cost-saving utility to diverse projects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution, emergence, immune interactions, diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and intervention tracking. Here, we describe case studies in which users can interrogate (1) SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) across different geographic regions to inform the design and testing of therapeutics, (2) SNVs that may impact the sensitivity of commonly used diagnostic primers, and (3) the recent emergence of a dominant lineage harboring an S477N RBD mutation in Australia. To accelerate COVID-19 research and public health efforts, COVID-19 CG will be continually upgraded with new features for users to quickly and reliably pinpoint mutations as the virus evolves throughout the pandemic and in response to therapeutic and public health interventions.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.310565""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.310565,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,False

Here we describe S-Trimer, a native-like trimeric subunit vaccine candidate for COVID-19 based on Trimer-Tag technology. Immunization of S-Trimer with either AS03 (oil-in-water emulsion) or CpG 1018 (TLR9 agonist) plus alum adjuvants induced high-levels of neutralizing antibodies and Th1-biased cellular immune responses in animal models. Moreover, rhesus macaques immunized with adjuvanted S-Trimer were protected from SARS-CoV-2 challenge compared to vehicle controls, based on clinical observations and reduction of viral loads in lungs.

108,Hamster and ferret experimental infection with intranasal low dose of a single strain of SARS-CoV-2,"Understanding the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is key to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies against COVID-19, in the case of severe illness but also when the disease is mild. The use of appropriate experimental animal models remains central in the in-vivo exploration of the physiopathology of infection and antiviral strategies. This study describes SARS-CoV-2 intra-nasal infection in ferrets and hamsters with low doses of low-passage SARS-CoV-2 clinical French isolate UCN19, describing infection levels, excretion, immune responses and pathological patterns in both animal species. Individual infection with 103 pfu SARS-CoV-2 induced a more severe disease in hamsters than in ferrets. Viral RNA was detected in the lungs of hamsters but not of ferrets and in the brain (olfactive and/or spinal bulbs) of both species. Overall, the clinical disease remained mild, with serological responses detected from 7 days and 10 days post inoculation in hamsters and ferrets respectively.

In search for therapeutic options, researchers have proposed resveratrol, a food supplement with known antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties as an advantageous antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection2-4. Here, we provide evidence that both resveratrol and its metabolically more stable structural analog, pterostilbene, exhibits potent antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Resveratrol and pterostilbene showed antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells and in human primary bronchial epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface system. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that both compounds actively interfere with the post-entry steps of virus replication cycle and their antiviral activity is long-lasting.

110,An evolutionary portrait of the progenitor SARS-CoV-2 and its dominant offshoots in COVID-19 pandemic,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, was quickly identified as the cause of COVID-19 disease soon after its earliest reports. The knowledge of the contemporary evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed not only for a retrospective on how, when, and why COVID-19 has emerged and spread, but also for creating remedies through efforts of science, technology, medicine, and public policy. Global sequencing of thousands of genomes has revealed many common genetic variants, which are the key to unraveling the early evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 and tracking its global spread over time. However, our knowledge of fundamental events in the evolution and spread of this coronavirus remains grossly incomplete and highly uncertain. Here, we present the heretofore cryptic mutational history, phylogeny, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from an analysis of tens of thousands of high-quality genomes. The reconstructed mutational progression is highly concordant with the timing of coronavirus sampling dates. It predicts the progenitor genome whose earliest offspring without any non-synonymous mutations were still spreading worldwide months after the report of COVID-19. Over time, mutations gave rise to seven major lineages that spread episodically, some of which arose in Europe and North America after the genesis of the ancestral lineages in China. Mutational barcoding establishes that North American coronaviruses harbor very different genome signatures than coronaviruses prevalent in Europe and Asia that have converged over time. These spatiotemporal patterns continue to evolve as the pandemic progresses and can be viewed live online.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski; Simone Hauck,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.311845""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.311845,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,False
111,Functional genomic screens identify human host factors for SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronaviruses,"The Coronaviridae are a family of viruses that causes disease in humans ranging from mild respiratory infection to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome. Finding host factors that are common to multiple coronaviruses could facilitate the development of therapies to combat current and future coronavirus pandemics. Here, we conducted parallel genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as well as two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E) and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we discovered phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses. These findings offer important insights for the understanding of the coronavirus life cycle as well as the potential development of host-directed therapies.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski; Simone Hauck; Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito; Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia; Agustin Perez-Garcia; Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312298""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.24.312298,2020-09-24,2020-09-24,,False
112,A vaccine built from potential immunogenic pieces derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a new global threat demanding a multidisciplinary effort to fight its etiological agent--severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this regard, immunoinformatics may aid to predict prominent immunogenic regions from critical SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, such as the spike (S) glycoprotein, for their use in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against this rapidly emerging coronavirus. Accordingly, in this study, an integrated immunoinformatics approach was applied to identify cytotoxic T cell (CTC), T helper cell (THC), and Linear B cell (BC) epitopes from the S glycoprotein in an attempt to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine. The best CTC, THC, and BC epitopes showed high viral antigenicity, lack of allergenic or toxic residues, and suitable HLA-viral peptide interactions. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its receptor-binding motif (RBM) harbour several potential epitopes. The structure prediction, refinement, and validation data indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine has an appropriate conformation and stability. Three conformational epitopes and an efficient binding between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the vaccine model were observed. Importantly, the population coverage analysis showed that the multi-epitope vaccine could be used globally. Notably, computer-based simulations suggest that the vaccine model has a robust potential to evoke and maximize both immune effector responses and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed to accomplish with the mandatory international guidelines for human vaccine formulations.

113,In silico identification and validation of inhibitors of the interaction between neuropilin receptor 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a multifunctional transmembrane receptor for ligands that affect developmental axonal growth and angiogenesis. In addition to a role in cancer, NRP-1 is a reported entry point for several viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The furin cleavage product of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein takes advantage of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) binding site on NRP-1 which accommodates a polybasic stretch ending in a C-terminal arginine. This site has long been a focus of drug discovery efforts for cancer therapeutics. We recently showed that interruption of the VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling pathway ameliorates neuropathic pain and hypothesize that interference of this pathway by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interferes with pain signaling. Here, we report hits from a small molecule and natural product screen of nearly 0.5 million compounds targeting the VEGF-A binding site on NRP-1. We identified nine chemical series with lead- or drug-like physico-chemical properties. Using an ELISA, we demonstrate that six compounds disrupt VEGF-A-NRP-1 binding more effectively than EG00229, a known NRP-1 inhibitor. Secondary validation in cells revealed that almost all tested compounds inhibited VEGF-A triggered VEGFR2 phosphorylation. Two compounds displayed robust inhibition of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus protein that utilizes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike for entry and fusion. These compounds represent a first step in a renewed effort to develop small molecule inhibitors of the VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling for the treatment of neuropathic pain and cancer with the added potential of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 virus entry.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308783""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308783,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,False
114,Cross-reactive serum and memory B cell responses to spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronavirus infection,"Pre-existing immune responses to seasonal endemic coronaviruses could have profound consequences for antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, either induced in natural infection or through vaccination. Such consequences are well established in the influenza and flavivirus fields. A first step to establish whether pre-existing responses can impact SARS-CoV-2 infection is to understand the nature and extent of cross-reactivity in humans to coronaviruses. We compared serum antibody and memory B cell responses to coronavirus spike (S) proteins from pre-pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors using a series of binding and functional assays. We found weak evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive serum antibodies in pre-pandemic donors. However, we found stronger evidence of pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cells that were activated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from the donors showed varying degrees of cross-reactivity with betacoronaviruses, including SARS and endemic coronaviruses. None of the cross-reactive mAbs were neutralizing except for one that targeted the S2 subunit of the S protein. The results suggest that pre-existing immunity to endemic coronaviruses should be considered in evaluating antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski; Simone Hauck; Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito; Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia; Agustin Perez-Garcia; Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop; Zhen Cui; Qing Ye; Geng Chen; Kui-Kui Lu; Yin Chen; Yu-Tao Chen; Hong-Xing Pan; Bao-Li Zhu; Cheng-Feng Qin,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308965""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308965,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,False

Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 displayed pathological and histological findings consistent with viral pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigens and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput sequencing of the virus from cat 2 revealed that the feline viral genome contained five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence. An analysis of cat 2s viral genome together with nine other feline-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared catspecific mutations. These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats developing mild or severe respiratory disease.

While the development of specific treatments and a vaccine is urgently needed, functional analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have been limited by the lack of convenient mutagenesis methods. In this study, we established a PCR-based, bacterium-free method to generate SARS-CoV-2 infectious clones. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 could be rescued at high titer with high accuracy after assembling 10 SARS-CoV-2 cDNA fragments by circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) and transfection of the resulting circular genome into susceptible cells. Notably, the construction of infectious clones for reporter viruses and mutant viruses could be completed in two simple steps: introduction of reporter genes or mutations into the desirable DNA fragments (~5,000 base pairs) by PCR and assembly of the DNA fragments by CPER. We hope that our reverse genetics system will contribute to the further understanding of SARS-CoV-2.",Tamires Martins Bastos; Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro; Rogerio Boff Borges; Carolina Meira Moser; Daniel Luccas Arenas; Ana Margareth Bassols; Pricilla Braga Laskoski; Simone Hauck; Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito; Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.309849""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.23.309849,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,False
117,A proof of concept for neutralizing antibody-guided vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2,"Mutations and transient conformational movements of receptor binding domain (RBD) that make neutralizing epitopes momentarily unavailable, present immune escape routes to SARS-CoV-2. To mitigate viral escape, we developed a cocktail of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting epitopes located on different domains of spike (S) protein. Screening of a library of monoclonal antibodies generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COVID-19 convalescent patients yielded potent NAbs, targeting N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD domain of S, effective at nM concentrations. Remarkably, combination of RBD-targeting NAbs and NTD-binding NAb, FC05, dramatically enhanced the neutralization potency in cell-based assays and animal model. Results of competitive SPR assays and cryo-EM structures of Fabs bound to S unveil determinants of immunogenicity. Combinations of immunogens, identified in NTD and RBD of S, when immunized in rabbits elicited potent protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. These results provide a proof-of-concept for neutralization-based immunogen design targeting SARS-CoV-2 NTD and RBD.

Objective: to present the preliminary psychometric properties of a Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) and its association with important outcomes, i.e., moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation. Methods: The BBES has 4 Likert-type items and was tested as part of a cross-sectional study that included 401 medical students. Reliability analysis and validity studies were performed. Results: In the parallel analysis, two factors were extracted, explaining 84.4% of the variance. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.78, showing high internal consistency. Considering a cut-off point of 12, the odds ratio for moderate to severe depression was 3.01 (CI 1.7-5.22; p<0.001) and for last month suicidal ideation 2.96 (CI 1.6-5.48). Conclusion: The results suggest good psychometric characteristics for the BBES, thus reinforcing its utility as an assessment tool for evaluating the well-being or distress of health professionals.

120,Puerto Rico Health System Resilience After Hurricane Maria: Implications for Disaster Preparedness in the COVID-19 Era,"Background: Every year, Puerto Rico faces a hurricane season fraught with potentially catastrophic structural, emotional and health consequences. In 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria, the largest natural disaster to ever affect the island. Several studies have estimated the excess morbidity and mortality following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, yet no study has comprehensively examined the underlying health system weaknesses contributing to the deleterious health outcomes. Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted to assess the ability of the UPR health system to provide patient care in response to Hurricane Maria. An established five key resilience framework and inductive analysis was used to identify factors that affected health system resilience. Thirteen Emergency Medicine Physicians, Family Medicine Physicians, and Hospital Administrators in a University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Community Hospital were interviewed as part of our study. Results: Of the five key resiliency components, three domains were notably weak with respect to UPR resiliency. Prior to the Hurricane, key personnel at the UPR hospital were unaware of the limited capacity of back-up generators at hospitals and were ill-prepared to transfer ICU patients to appropriate hospitals. Post Hurricane, the hospital faced self-regulation challenges when triaging the provision of Hurricane-related emergency services with delivering core health services, in particular for patients with chronic conditions. Finally, during and after the Hurricane, integration of patient care coordination between the UPR hospital ambulances, neighboring hospitals, and national and state government was suboptimal. The two remaining resiliency factors, addressing diverse needs and system adaptiveness in a time of crisis, were seen as strengths. Conclusions: Hurricane Maria exposed weaknesses in the Puerto Rican health system, notably the lack of awareness about the limited capacity of backup generators, poor patient care coordination, and interruption of medical care for patients with chronic conditions. As in other countries, the current COVID epidemic is taxing the capacity of the Puerto Rico health system, which could increase the likelihood of another health system collapse should another hurricane hit the island.

121,The effect of COVID-19 on the economy: evidence from an early adopter of localized lockdowns,"Background. Governments worldwide have implemented large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing or school closures, to prevent and control the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies, implemented with varying stringency, have imposed substantial social and economic costs to society. As some countries begin to reopen and ease mobility restrictions, lockdowns in smaller geographic areas are increasingly being considered as an attractive policy intervention to mitigate societal costs while controlling epidemic growth. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support these decisions. Methods. Drawing from a rich dataset of localized lockdowns in Chile, we used econometric methods to measure the reduction in local economic activity from lockdowns when applied to smaller or larger geographical areas. We measured economic activity by tax collection at the municipality-level. Findings. Results show lockdowns were associated with a 10-15% drop in local economic activity, a two-fold reduction compared to municipalities not under lockdown. A three-to-four-month lockdown had a similar effect on economic activity than the year of the 2009 great recession. We found that costs are proportional to the population under lockdown, without differences when lockdowns were measured at the municipality or city-wide levels. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that localized lockdowns have a large effect on local economic activity, but these effects are proportional to the population under lockdown. Our results suggest that epidemiological criteria should guide decisions about the optimal size of lockdown areas; the proportional effects of lockdowns on the economy seem to be unchanged by scale.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

122,Environmental impact of Personal Protective Equipment supplied to health and social care services in England in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objectives Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has been central to controlling spread of SARS-CoV2. This study aims to quantify the environmental impact of this, and to model strategies for its reduction. Methods Life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts of PPE supplied to health and social care in England during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The base scenario assumed all products were single-use, air freighted, and disposed via clinical waste. Scenario modelling was used to determine the effect of 1) switching mode of, or eliminating, international travel during supply, 2) reducing glove use 3) using reusable alternatives, 4) maximal recycling. Results The carbon footprint of PPE supplied during the study period totalled 158,838 tonnes CO2e, with greatest contributions from gloves, aprons, face shields, and Type IIR surgical masks. The estimated damage to human health was 314 DALYs (disability adjusted life years), impact on ecosystems was 0.67 species.year (loss of local species per year), and impact on resource depletion costing US $ 20.4 million. Scenario modelling indicated one-third of the carbon footprint could be avoided through switching to shipping, and by 41% through manufacturing PPE in the UK. The carbon footprint was reduced by 83% compared with the base scenario through a combination of UK manufacturing, reducing glove use, using reusable gowns and reuse of face shields, and maximal recycling, estimated to save 259 DALYS, 0.54 species.year, and US $ 15 million due to resource depletion. Conclusions The environmental impact of PPE could be reduced through shipping supplies or domestic manufacture, rationalising glove use, using reusables where possible, and optimising waste management.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

123,Delayed viral clearance and exacerbated airway hyperinflammation in hypertensive COVID-19 patients,"In COVID-19, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases have emerged as major risk factors for critical disease progression. Concurrently, the impact of the main anti-hypertensive therapies, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), on COVID-19 severity is controversially discussed. By combining clinical data, single-cell sequencing data of airway samples and in vitro experiments, we assessed the cellular and pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 driven by cardiovascular disease and its treatment options. Anti-hypertensive ACEi or ARB therapy, was not associated with an altered expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and thus presumably does not change susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we observed a more critical progress in COVID-19 patients with hypertension associated with a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells. While ACEi treatment was associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and intrinsic anti-viral responses, under ARB treatment enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions were observed. Macrophages and neutrophils of COVID-19 patients with hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of CCL3, CCL4, and its receptor CCR1, which associated with critical COVID-19 progression. Overall, these results provide a potential explanation for the adverse COVID-19 course in patients with cardiovascular disease, i.e. an augmented immune response in critical cells for the disease course, and might suggest a beneficial effect of clinical ACEi treatment in hypertensive COVID-patients.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

124,Epidemiology and precision of SARS-CoV-2 detection following lockdown and relaxation measures,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2-detection is critical for clinical and epidemiological assessment of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. Aim: To cross-validate manual and automated high-throughput (Roche-cobas6800-Target1/Target2) testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, to describe detection rates following lockdown and relaxation, and to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-loads in different specimens. Method: The validation cohort prospectively compared Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas6800-Target1/Target2 in 1344 naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) taken in calendar week 13 using Basel-ORF8-gene-assay for confirmation. Follow-up-cohort-1 and -2 comprised 12363 and 10207 NOPS taken over 10 weeks until calendar week 24 and 34, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-loads were compared in follow-up NOPS, lower respiratory fluids, and plasma. Results: Concordant results were obtained in 1308 cases (97%) including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman r>0.95; p<0.001) for all assays. Discordant samples (N=36) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2-loads (p<0.001). Following lockdown, weekly detection rates declined to <1% reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% with similarly high SARS-CoV-2-loads, but patients were significantly younger than during lockdown (34 vs 52 years, p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2-loads in follow-up NOPS declined by 3log10 copies/mL within 10 days post-diagnosis (p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2-loads in NOPS correlated weakly with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids and plasma, but remained detectable in 14 and 7 cases of NOPS with undetectable SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Conclusion: Evaluated manual and automated assays are highly concordant and correlate quantitatively. Following successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require dual-target-assays for clinical and epidemiologic assessment. Confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be considered within <5 days, using lower respiratory fluids in symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

125,Dynamic Change of COVID-19 Seroprevalence among Asymptomatic Population in Tokyo during the Second Wave,"Importance: Fatality rates related to COVID-19 in Japan have been low compared to Western Countries and have decreased despite the absence of lockdown. Serological tests monitored across the course of the second wave can provide insights into the population-level prevalence and dynamic patterns of COVID-19 infection. Objective: To assess changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic employees working in Tokyo during the second wave. Design: We conducted an observational cohort study. Healthy volunteers working for a Japanese company in Tokyo were enrolled from disparate locations to determine seropositivity against COVID19 from May 26 to August 25, 2020. COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined by a rapid COVID19 IgM/IgG test kit using fingertip blood. Across the company, tests were performed and acquired weekly. For each participant, serology tests were offered twice, separated by approximately a month, to provide self-reference of test results and to assess for seroconversion and seroreversion. Setting: Workplace setting within a large company. Participants: Healthy volunteers from 1877 employees of a large Japanese company were recruited to the study from 11 disparate locations across Tokyo. Participants having fever, cough, or shortness of breath at the time of testing were excluded. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Seropositivity rate (SPR) was calculated by pooled data from each two-weeks window across the cohort. Either IgM or IgG positivity was defined as seropositive. Changes in immunological status against SARS-CoV-2 were determined by comparing results between two tests obtained from the same individual. Results: Six hundred fifteen healthy volunteers (mean + SD 40.8 + 10.0; range 19-69; 45.7 % female) received at least one test. Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over the course of the summer. The most dramatic increase in SPR occurred in late June and early July, paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo, which peaked on August 4. Out of the 350 individuals (mean + SD 42.5 + 10.0; range 19-69; 46.0 % female) who completed both offered tests, 21.4 % of those individuals who tested seronegative became seropositive and seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants. 81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo despite the very low fatality rate. Given the temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the decrease in reported COVID-19 cases that occurred without a shut-down, herd immunity may be implicated. Sequential testing for serological response against COVID-19 is useful for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection at the population-level.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

127,"Heat Stress and PPE during COVID-19: Impact on health care workers' performance, safety and well-being in NHS settings.","Background: The impermeable nature of PPE worn by health care workers (HCWs) during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic can potentiate heat stress which may negatively impact the performance, safety and well-being of HCWs. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate perceived levels of heat stress and its consequences in HCWs required to wear PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Method: An anonymous online survey was distributed to HCWs required to wear Type 1 or 2 PPE in NHS settings to evaluate the perceived impact of PPE on: (1) physical and cognitive performance; (2) heat stress and heat-related symptoms; (3) frequency of removing PPE due to discomfort caused by heat stress; and (4) general working-life and well-being. Results: The survey received 224 responses from 192 (85.7%) women and 32 (14.3%) men. Even though 71.9% of respondents wore the less thermally challenging PPE (i.e. Type 2), a median of 3 (IQR: 2,5) heat-related symptoms were reported including syncope (7.7%). A median of 1 (IQR: 0-3) cognitive task was adversely affected with attentional focus being the most affected. To relieve discomfort, 32.6% reported removing PPE on five or more occasions in a shift. Ninety two percent reported PPE made their job more difficult and 76.2% advised that physical performance was impaired. Respondents also highlighted concerns of dermatitis and pressure sores in the facial region (22.3%) amongst other factors. Conclusion: Heat stress experienced when PPE is worn negatively impacts the performance, safety and well-being of HCWs and patients. Therefore, modification to current working practices and current design of PPE is urgently required to improve HCWs resilience to pandemics of infectious diseases. Results suggest modifications to the design of the protective face mask and strict enforcement of specific work/rest ratios to limit the duration of PPE use would be immediate impactful interventions.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

128,Efficacy and Safety of Guduchi Ghan Vati in the Management of Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection: An Open Label Feasibility Study,"Background: Guduchi Ghan Vati (aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia) is an essential herbal plant in Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) that is well documented as an immunomodulator and antimicrobial agent. A recent in silico study found the therapeutic efficacy of Guduchi against SARS-CoV-2. Based on available evidence, we conducted a feasibility study of the safety and efficacy of Guduchi Ghan Vati in asymptomatic patients with covid-19. Patients and methods: An open label, feasibility trial was conducted on 46 patients in the hospital setting. A single-arm study with no control group and blinding was executed in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. All patients orally received 2 tablets (1000 mg) twice daily for 2 weeks. Clinical parameters were collected at baseline, day 3, day 7 and day 14. Patients were continuously monitored for side effects and adverse reactions during the study period. . Results: Out of 46 asymptomatic patients included in the study, 40 completed the 14-day follow-up period. None developed any Covid-19 symptoms after admission to the hospital. On day 3 post-treatment, viral clearance was reported in 16 (32.5%) patients. By the end of D-7, 38 (95%) patients had viral load disappearance. Follow-up at D-14 showed that all participants tested negative. Conclusion: In adult patients with asymptomatic Covid-19, Gudhuchi Ghan Vati could be effective.

So far, insufficient or excessive T cell responses were described in patients. We applied novel approaches to analyze T cell reactivity and showed that T anergy is already present in non-ventilated COVID-19 patients, very pronounced in ventilated patients, strongly associated with virus persistence and reversible with clinical recovery. T cell activation was measured by downstream effects on responder cells like basophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophils in whole blood and proved to be much more meaningful than classical readouts with PBMCs. Monocytes responded stronger in males than females and IL-2 partially reversed T cell anergy. Downstream markers of T cell anergy were also found in fresh blood samples of critically ill patients with severe T cell anergy.

131,Optimal Dynamic Prioritization of Scarce COVID-19 Vaccines,"Multiple promising COVID-19 vaccines are under rapid development, with deployment of the initial supply expected by 2021. Careful design of a vaccine prioritization strategy across socio-demographic groups is an imminent and crucial public policy challenge given that (1) the eventual vaccine supply will be highly constrained for at least the first several months of the vaccination campaign, and (2) there are stark differences in transmission and severity of impacts from SARS-CoV-2 across groups. Previous experience with vaccine development mid-pandemic offers limited insights for SARS-CoV-2 prioritization: SARS and Zika vaccine development was incomplete when those outbreaks ended and the epidemiology of endemic human influenza viruses differ substantially from that of SARS-CoV-2. We assess the optimal allocation of a limited and dynamic COVID-19 vaccine supply in the U.S. across socio-demographic groups differentiated by age and essential worker status. The transmission dynamics are modeled using a compartmental (SEIR) model parameterized to capture our current understanding of the transmission and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, severity, and contact rates). We investigate tradeoffs between three alternative policy objectives: minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths. Moreover, we model dynamic vaccine prioritization policies that respond to changes in the epidemiological status of the population as SARS-CoV-2 continues its march. Because contacts tend to be concentrated within age groups, there is diminishing marginal returns as vaccination coverage increases in a given group, increasing the group's protective immunity against infection and mortality. We find that optimal prioritization consistently targets older essential workers. However, depending on the policy objective, younger essential workers are prioritized to minimize infections or seniors in order to minimize mortality. Optimal prioritization outperforms non-targeted vaccination strategies by up to 18% depending on the outcome optimized. For example, in our baseline model, cumulative mortality decreased on average by 17% (25,000 deaths in the U.S. population) over the course of the outbreak.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

This was an observational study with a cross-sectional and time series design based on data from the information system of the State Department of Health of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The microdata from the epidemiological bulletin is open and in the public domain; consultation was carried out from March to July 2020. The incidences were stratified per 100,000 inhabitants. The cross-section study was conducted to describe COVID-19 cases, and the trend analysis was performed using polynomial regression models for time series, with R-Studio software and a significance level of 5%. There was a predominance of women among the cases, and of men in terms of deaths. The presence of comorbidities was statistically related to mortality, particularly lung disease and diabetes, and the mean age of the deaths was 67.7 years. Even though the macro-region of the state capital, Campo Grande, had a higher number of cases, the most fatalities were in the macro-region of Corumba.

134,A Cost Analysis of Childbirth for Pregnant Women with COVID-19 in the Epicentre of Nigeria,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a major disruptor of health systems globally. Its emergence has warranted the need to reorganize maternity services for childbirth. However, it is not known if this comes at an additional cost to women. We conducted a hospital-based cost analysis to estimate the out-of-pocket cost of spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) and caesarean delivery (CD). Specifically, we collected facility-based and household costs of all nine pregnant women with COVID-19 who were managed between 1st April and 30th August 2020 at the largest teaching hospital in Lagos, the epicentre of COVID-19 in Nigeria. We compared the mean facility-based costs for the cohort with costs paid by pregnant women pre-COVID-19, identifying major cost drivers. We also estimated what would have been paid without subsidies, testing assumptions with a sensitivity analysis. Findings showed that total utilization cost ranged from US$494 (N190,150) for SVD with mild COVID-19 to US$4,553 (N1,751,165) for emergency CD with severe COVID-19. Though 32-66% of facility-based cost has been subsidized, cost of SVD and CD have doubled and tripled respectively during the pandemic compared to those paid pre-COVID. Out of the facility-based costs paid, cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) was the major cost driver (50%) for SVD and CD. Supplemental oxygen was a major cost driver when women had severe COVID-19 symptoms and required long admission (48%). Excluding treatment costs specifically for COVID-19, mean facility-based costs for SVD and CD are US$228 (N87,750) and US$948 (N364,551) respectively. Our study demonstrates that despite cost exemptions and donations, utilization costs remain prohibitive. Regulation of the PPE and medical oxygen supply chain can help drive down utilization cost and reduce mark-ups being passed to users.

Design: Rapid review with meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. Methods: We searched databases including Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and Google Scholar up to 26th August 2020 for studies describing COVID-19 outcomes in PLWH and conducted a meta-analysis of higher quality studies. Results: We identified 1,908 studies and included 19 in the review. In a meta-analysis of five studies, PLWH had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.93, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.59-2.34) compared to people without HIV. Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalised cohorts (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.05-2.24) and studies of PLWH across all settings (HR 2.08, 95%CI: 1.69-2.56). Eight other studies assessed the association between HIV and COVID-19 outcomes, but provided inconclusive, lower-quality evidence due to potential confounding and selection bias. There were insufficient data on the effect of CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load on COVID-19 outcomes. Eleven studies reported COVID-19 outcomes by ART-regimen. In the two largest studies, tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF)-based regimens were associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, although these analyses are susceptible to confounding by comorbidities. Conclusion: Evidence is emerging that suggests a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 mortality amongst PLWH.

136,Seroprevalence of immunoglobulin M and G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in ophthalmic patients,"Using serological test to estimate the prevalence and infection potential of coronavirus disease 2019 in ocular diseases patients help understand the relationship between ocular diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We conducted a cross-sectional study assaying the IgG and IgM antibodies in 1331 individuals with ocular diseases by using a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay kit, during the period from February 2020 to May 2020. In our study, the seroposivity in total ocular disease patients was 0.83% (11/1331). The patients with different ocular diseases including xerophthalmia, keratitis, conjunctival cyst, cataract, glaucoma, refractive error, strabismus and others had seroposivity of 2.94%, 12.5%, 25%, 4.41%, 2.63%, 1.6%, 2.22% and 0%, respectively. Among that, two ocular surface disease groups (keratitis and conjunctival cyst) had higher seroprevalence compared with others. All the participants were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction negative for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swabs. Our study evaluated the seroprevalence in patients with different ocular diseases, which will help us understand the relationship between ocular disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the serological test for the presence of IgM and/or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 might provide accurate estimate of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with ocular diseases.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

137,COVID-19 dynamics across the US: A deep learning study of human mobility and social behavior,"This paper presents a deep learning framework for epidemiology system identification from noisy and sparse observations with quantified uncertainty. The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Strikingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the basic reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously inform policy and decision making.

139,Challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic for perinatal mental health care: a mixed methods study of mental health care staff,"Purpose: the aim of this study was to explore staff perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health service delivery and outcomes for women who were pregnant or in the first year after birth (perinatal women). Methods: secondary analysis of an online mixed-methods survey open to all mental health care staff in the UK involving 363 staff working with women in the perinatal period. Results: staff perceived the mental health of perinatal women to be particularly vulnerable to the impact of stressors associated with the pandemic such as social isolation (rated by 79.3% as relevant or extremely relevant; 288/363) and domestic violence and abuse (53.3%; 192/360). As a result of changes to mental health and other health and social care services, staff reported feeling less able to assess women, particularly their relationship with their baby (43.3%; 90/208), and to mobilise safeguarding procedures (29.4%; 62/211). While 42% of staff reported that some women engaged poorly with virtual appointments, they also found flexible remote consulting to be beneficial for some women and helped time management due to reductions in travel time. Conclusions: delivery of perinatal care needs to be tailored to the needs of women; virtual appointments are perceived not to be appropriate for assessments but may be helpful for some women in subsequent interactions. Safeguarding and other risk assessment procedures must remain robust in spite of modifications made to service delivery during pandemics.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

There is little evidence regarding the feasibility of universal, asymptomatic testing to control outbreaks in this population. This study aimed to pilot mass COVID-19 testing on a university research park, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of scaling up to all staff and students. Methods This was a cross-sectional feasibility study on a university research park in the East of England. Staff and students (5,625) on the research park were eligible to participate. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was offered to all participants. Participants were offered 4 swabs, which they self-administered over a two-week period. Outcome measures included: uptake; drop-out rate; positivity rates; participant acceptability measures; laboratory processing measures. Results 798/1053 (76%) of those who registered provided at least one swab and of these, 687 (86%) provided all four. 681/687 (99%) had all negative results. 6 participants had one inconclusive result. There were no positive results. 458/798 (57%) participants responded to a post-testing questionnaire. 446/458 (97.5%) of those who responded agreed that they would be interested in repeat testing in the future.

141,Early Humoral Response Correlates with Disease Severity and Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, continues to spread globally with significantly high morbidity and mortality rates. Immunological surrogate markers, in particular antigen-specific responses, are of unquestionable value for clinical management of patients with COVID-19. Here, we investigated the kinetics of IgM, IgG against the spike (S) and nucleoproteins (N) proteins and their neutralizing capabilities in hospitalized patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, IgM and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were readily detectable in almost all COVID-19 patients with various clinical presentations. Notably, anti-S and -N IgG, peaked 20-40 day after disease onset, and were still detectable for at least up to 70 days, with nAbs observed during the same time period. Moreover, nAbs titers were strongly correlated with IgG antibodies. Significantly higher levels of nAbs as well as anti-S1 and N IgG and IgM antibodies were found in patients with more severe clinical presentations, patients requiring admission to intensive care units (ICU) or those with fatal outcomes. Interestingly, lower levels of antibodies, particularly anti-N IgG and IgM in the first 15 days after symptoms onset, were found in survivors and those with mild clinical presentations. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the characteristics and kinetics of antibody responses in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity.",Scott Wesley Long; Randall J Olsen; Paul A.

The rapid spread of the G614 mutant suggests that it may have a transmission advantage over the D614 wildtype. Using our previous epidemiological framework to analyze COVID-19 surveillance and sequence data, we estimated that the G614 mutant is 31% (28-34%) more transmissible than the D614 wildtype. As such, interventions that were previously effective in containing or mitigating the D614 wildtype (e.g. in China, Vietnam, Thailand, etc.) might be less effective against the G614 mutant.

147,Smoking is associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 particularly among younger adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Smoking impairs lung immune functions and damages upper airways, increasing risks of contracting and severity of infectious diseases. Methods: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies published from January 1-May 25, 2020. We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease, including death. We used a random effects meta-analysis and used meta-regression and lowess regressions to examine relationships in the data. Results: We identified 47 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 31,871 COVID-19 patients, 5,759 (18.1%) experienced disease progression and 5,734 (18.0%) with a history of smoking. Among smokers, 29.2% experienced disease progression, compared with 21.1% of non-smokers. The meta-analysis confirmed an association between smoking and COVID-19 progression (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.32-1.83, p=0.001). Smoking was associated with increased risk of death from COVID-19 (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.34, p=0.007). We found no significant difference (p=0.432) between the effects of smoking on COVID-19 disease progression between adjusted and unadjusted analyses, suggesting that smoking is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 disease progression. We also found the risk of having COVID-19 progression among younger adults (p=0.023), with the effect most pronounced among people under about 45 years old. Conclusions: Smoking is an independent risk for having severe progression of COVID-19, including mortality. The effects seem to be higher among young people.

The impact of the pandemic is both social and economic. Pregnancy is an exciting and sometimes stressful experience. Being pregnant during a disease outbreak may add extra anxiety and concern for pregnant women and for those who provide care for them [1, 2]. During the initial stages of the pandemic, it appeared Africa would be spared the burden of COVID-19. However, by April 7th, a total of 45 countries within the WHO African region had reported over 7000 cases (although some place it at over 10 000), with at least 292 deaths and 612 people recovered. Ethiopia, being one of the developing countries trying to address the diverse needs of its people, is currently at the verge of the epidemic [5, 7]. Objectives: The general objective of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and reproductive health care services among mothers getting service in governmental health institutions of Dessie town, 2020 G.C. Methods: Institution based cross sectional study design using mixed (quantitative supplemented with qualitative) method was employed to identify the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal and reproductive health care services among women who get service in governmental health institutions of Dessie town. The study was conducted from July 1-15 / 2020. Result: According to this study, Six percent (6%) of antenatal care attendees, 18% of delivery care attendees and nearly half (46.7%) of postnatal care attendees reported inappropriate service delivery due to fear of health care providers, shortage medical supplies and staff work load. The study also showed that utilization of these services was decreased due to fear of clients to go to health institutions. Conclusion and recommendation: This study concluded that COVID-19 significantly affects the quality and utilization of maternal and reproductive health care services. The study also showed that utilization of these services was decreased due to fear of clients to go to health institutions.

149,Molecular Architecture of Early Disseminationand Massive Second Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in a Major Metropolitan Area,"We sequenced the genomes of 5,085 SARS-CoV-2 strains causing two COVID-19 disease waves in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an ethnically diverse region with seven million residents. The genomes were from viruses recovered in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic in Houston, and an ongoing massive second wave of infections. The virus was originally introduced into Houston many times independently. Virtually all strains in the second wave have a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased transmission and infectivity. Patients infected with the Gly614 variant strains had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis. We found little evidence of a significant relationship between virus genotypes and altered virulence, stressing the linkage between disease severity, underlying medical conditions, and host genetics. Some regions of the spike protein - the primary target of global vaccine efforts - are replete with amino acid replacements, perhaps indicating the action of selection. We exploited the genomic data to generate defined single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain of spike protein that, importantly, produced decreased recognition by the neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR30022. Our study is the first analysis of the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in two infection waves in a major metropolitan region.

This study aims to investigate the association between soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and COVID-19 as a prognostic biomarker to predict the disease severity, lethality and clinical management.Methods: We enrolled 91 patients with COVID-19 in domiciliary care (44 patients) or in hospital care (47 patients), who were classified after admission into mild, moderate, severe and critical groups according to their clinical scores. As non-COVID-19 control, 30 healthy volunteers were included. Data on demographic, comorbidities and baseline clinical characteristics were obtained from their medical and nurse records. Peripheral blood samples were collected at admission and after hospitalization outcome to assess cytokine profile and sTREM-1 level by specific immunoassays Results: Within COVID-19 patients, the highest severity was associated with the most significant elevated plasma levels sTREM-1. Using receiver operating curve analysis (ROC), sTREM-1 was found to be predictive of disease severity (AUC= 0.988) and the best cut-off value for predicting in-hospital severity was [&ge;] 116.5 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 93.3% and specificity for 95.8%. We also described the clinical characteristics of these patients and explored the correlation with markers of the disease aggravation. The levels of sTREM-1 were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-10, blood neutrophils counts, and critical disease scoring (r= 0.68, p<0.0001). On the other hand, sTREM-1 level was significantly negative correlated with lymphocytes counting, and mild disease (r= -0.42, p<0.0001). Higher levels of sTREM-1 were related to poor outcome and death, patients who received dexamethasone tended to have lower sTREM-1 levels. Conclusion: Our results indicated that sTREM-1 in COVID-19 is associated with severe disease development and a prognostic marker for mortality. The use of severity biomarkers such as sTREM-1 together with patients clinical scores could improve the early recognition and monitoring of COVID-19 cases with higher risk of disease worsening.

The purpose of the study was to assess the preparedness of ART clinics and staff to resume services and patients reasons to initiate treatment and key performance indicators (KPIs) of ART labs during pandemic. Methods: Semi-descriptive report of two private in-vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics in Maharashtra, India, when COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic people was unavailable. Time required for replenishing laboratory supplies, and staff preparedness to function under new norms of pandemic was documented. Infection mitigation measures at workplace and triaging strategy were evaluated. KPIs of the clinics were evaluated. Results: One-third of the patients consulted through telemedicine accepted or were eligible to initiate treatment upon clinic resumption. Lack of safe transport and financial constraints prevented majority from undergoing IVF, and only 9 percent delayed treatment due to fear of pandemic. With adequate training, staff compliance to meet new demands could be achieved within a week, but supply of consumables was a major constraint. 52 cycles of IVF were performed including fresh cycles and frozen embryo transfers with satisfactory KPIs even during pandemic.

153,Self-applied ELCSA is valid for rapid tracking of household food insecurity among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Background Rapid household food insecurity (HFI) tracking has been identified as a priority in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. We report the validation of the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (Escala Latinoamericana y Caribena de Seguridad Alimentaria -ELCSA) among pregnant women in Sri Lanka. Methods The adult eight-items of the English version of ELCSA was translated into Sinhala and Tamil. Cognitive testing (on ten pregnant women and five local experts) and psychometric validation of the self-administered HFI tool was conducted among pregnant women (n=269) attending the Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort (RaPCo) special clinics in Anuradhapura in February 2020. We assessed psychometric properties and fit using a one parameter logistic model (Rasch analysis) using STATA version 14 and WINSTEP software version 4.3.4. Concurrent validity was tested using psychological distress. Results The scale was internally consistent (Cronbachs alpha = 0.79), had a good model fit (Rasch infit statistic range: 0.85 to 1.07). Item 8 (did not eat for the whole day) was removed from the model fit analysis as it was not affirmed by anyone. Item severity scores ranged from -2.15 for not eating a diverse diet to 4.43 for not eating during the whole day. Concurrent validity between HFI and psychological distress was confirmed (r=0.15, p<0.05). Conclusions The self-applied version of ELCSA- pregnancy in Sri Lanka (ELCSA-P-SL) is a valid and feasible tool to track HFI among pregnant women in similar contexts during the COVID-19 pandemic, where social distancing is a major concern and its aftermath.",Nicolas Veyrenche; Karine Bollore; Amandine Pisoni; Anne-Sophie Bedin; Anne-Marie Mondain; Jacques Ducos; Michel Segondy; Brigitte Montes,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199380""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199380,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
154,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fourteen wastewater treatment systems in Uttarakhand and Rajasthan States of North India,"We investigated the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA at different treatment stages of 15 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in two North Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Untreated (influent), biologically treated, and disinfected wastewater samples were collected from May to August 2020. The qualitative analysis of the wastewater for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was done using different pre-processing methods. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 11 out of 39 wastewater samples in Jaipur district and 5 out of 17 wastewater samples in Haridwar District using Reverse-Transcriptase Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) for qualitative detection. None of the 56 samples tested for post-secondary or tertiary treatment were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The findings indicate that there are no SARS-CoV-2 related risks involved with using the treated effluent for non-potable applications. In contrast, untreated wastewater may be a potential route of viral transmission to the WWTP and sanitation workers. Future studies are imperative to understand the survival rates of these viruses in wastewater.",Nicolas Veyrenche; Karine Bollore; Amandine Pisoni; Anne-Sophie Bedin; Anne-Marie Mondain; Jacques Ducos; Michel Segondy; Brigitte Montes; Patrick Pastor; David Morquin; Alain Makinson,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197178""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197178,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
155,"Ethnic differences in COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and mortality: an OpenSAFELY analysis of 17 million adults in England","Background: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority populations, both in the UK and internationally. To date, much of the evidence has been derived from studies within single healthcare settings, mainly those hospitalised with COVID-19. Working on behalf of NHS England, the aim of this study was to identify ethnic differences in the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality using a large general population cohort in England. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study using linked primary care records of 17.5 million adults between 1 February 2020 and 3 August 2020. Exposure was self-reported ethnicity collapsed into the 5 and 16 ethnicity categories of the English Census. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify ethnic differences in the risk of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and COVID-19 mortality, adjusted for socio-demographic factors, clinical co-morbidities, geographic region, care home residency, and household size. Results: A total of 17,510,002 adults were included in the study; 63% white (n=11,030,673), 6% south Asian (n=1,034,337), 2% black (n=344,889), 2% other (n=324,730), 1% mixed (n=172,551), and 26% unknown (n=4,602,822). After adjusting for measured explanatory factors, south Asian, black, and mixed groups were marginally more likely to be tested (south Asian HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.07-1.09; black HR 1.08; 95%CI 1.06-1.09, mixed HR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and substantially more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.02. 95% CI 1.97-2.07; black HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.61-1.76; mixed HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.36-1.56). The risk of being admitted to ICU for COVID-19 was substantially increased in all ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.22, 95%CI 1.96-2.52; black HR 3.07, 95%CI 2.61-3.61; mixed HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.19-3.75, other HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.31-3.63). Risk of COVID-19 mortality was increased by 25-56% in ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.17-1.38; black HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.38-1.75; mixed HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.12-1.76; other HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.05-1.49). We observed heterogeneity of associations after disaggregation into detailed ethnic groupings; Indian and African groups were at higher risk of all outcomes; Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Caribbean groups were less or equally likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, but at higher risk of all other outcomes, Chinese groups were less likely to be tested for and test positive for SARS-CoV-2, more likely to be admitted to ICU, and equally likely to die from COVID-19. Conclusions: We found evidence of substantial ethnic inequalities in the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, ICU admission, and mortality, which persisted after accounting for explanatory factors, including household size. It is likely that some of this excess risk is related to factors not captured in clinical records such as occupation, experiences of structural discrimination, or inequitable access to health and social services. Prioritizing linkage between health, social care, and employment data and engaging with ethnic minority communities to better understand their lived experiences is essential for generating evidence to prevent further widening of inequalities in a timely and actionable manner.",Nicolas Veyrenche; Karine Bollore; Amandine Pisoni; Anne-Sophie Bedin; Anne-Marie Mondain; Jacques Ducos; Michel Segondy; Brigitte Montes; Patrick Pastor; David Morquin; Alain Makinson; Vincent Le Moing; Philippe Van De Perre; Vincent Foulongne; Edouard Tuaillon; Tamara Raschka; Jindrich Cinatl Jr.; Lauren DeLong; Philip Gribbon; Gerd Geisslinger; Sandra Ciesek; David van Dijk Jr.; Steve Gardner; Alpha Tom Kodamullil; Holger Froehlich; Manuel Peitsch; Marc Jacobs; Julia Hoeng; Roland Eils; Carsten Claussen; Martin Hofmann-Apitius; David Harrison; Kathy Rowan; Kamlesh Khunti; Nish Chaturvedi; Liam Smeeth; Ben Goldacre,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20198754""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20198754,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
156,Modelling the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection through PPE doffing in a hospital environment,"Self-contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a concern for healthcare workers (HCW) following SARS-CoV-2 positive patient care. Staff may subconsciously become contaminated through improper glove removal, so quantifying this risk is critical for safe working procedures. HCW surface contact sequences on a respiratory ward were modelled using a discrete-time Markov chin for: IV-drip care, blood pressure monitoring and doctors' rounds. Accretion of viral RNA on gloves during care was modelled using a stochastic recurrence relation. The HCW then doffed PPE and contaminated themselves in a fraction of cases based on increasing case load. The risk of infection from this exposure was quantified using a dose-response methodology. A parametric study was conducted to analyse the effect of: 1a) increasing patient numbers on the ward, 1b) the proportion of COVID-19 cases, 2) the length of a shift and 3) the probability of touching contaminated PPE. The driving factors for infection risk were surface contamination and number of surface contacts. HCWs on a 100% COVID-19 ward were less than 2-fold more at risk than on a 50% COVID ward (1.6% vs 1%), whilst on a 5% COVID-19 ward, the risk dropped to 0.1% per shift (sd=0.6%). IV-drip care resulted in higher risk than blood pressure monitoring (1.1% vs 1% p<0.0001), whilst doctors' rounds produced a 0.6% risk (sd=0.8%). Recommendations include supervised PPE doffing procedures such as the ""doffing buddy"" scheme, maximising hand hygiene compliance post-doffing and targeted surface cleaning for surfaces away from the patient vicinity.",Nicolas Veyrenche; Karine Bollore; Amandine Pisoni; Anne-Sophie Bedin; Anne-Marie Mondain; Jacques Ducos; Michel Segondy; Brigitte Montes; Patrick Pastor; David Morquin; Alain Makinson; Vincent Le Moing; Philippe Van De Perre; Vincent Foulongne,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.20.20197368""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.20.20197368,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

159,Downregulation of Defensin genes in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Defensins, crucial components of the innate immune system, play a vital role against infection as part of frontline immunity. Association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with defensins has not been investigated till date. In this study, we have investigated the expression of defensin genes in the buccal cavity during COVID-19 infection. Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal swab samples collected for screening SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed for the expression of major defensin genes by the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, qRT-PCR. 40 SARS-CoV-2 infected positive and 40 negative swab samples were selected for the study. Based on the RT-PCR analysis involving gene specific primer for defensin genes, 10 defensin genes were found to be expressed in the Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal cavity. Six defensin genes were further found to be significantly downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients as against the control, negative samples based on differential expression analysis. The genes significantly downregulated were defensin beta 4A, 4B, 106B, 107B, 103A and defensin alpha 1B. Downregulation of several defensin genes suggests that innate immunity provided by defensins is or may be compromised in SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in progression of the disease caused by the virus. Upregulation of defensin gene expression and use of defensin peptides could be attractive therapeutic interventions.",Nicolas Veyrenche; Karine Bollore; Amandine Pisoni; Anne-Sophie Bedin,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20195537""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20195537,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True
160,Putting (Big) Data in Action: Saving Lives with Countrywide Population Movement Monitoring Using Mobile Devices during the COVID-19 Crisis,"Many countries have implemented strict social distancing measures in the hope of reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but the effectiveness of these measures is determined by the willingness of populations to comply with restrictions. Consequently, a system of monitoring population movement using existing data sources can inform those making decisions about policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe a collaboration with all 3 major domestic telecommunication companies in Hungary to use aggregated anonymous mobile phone usage data to calculate two indices for assessing the effect of movement restrictions: a ""mobility-index"" and a ""stay-at-home (or resting) index"". The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are compared with the smartphone-based, COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports from Google. Data generated by mobile phones have long been identified as a potential means to analyse mass population movement, but its operationalisation raises several technical questions, such as making sense of Call Detail Records, collation of data from different mobile network providers, and personal data protection concerns. The method described here addresses these issues and offers an effective and inexpensive tool to monitor the impact of social distancing measures, achieving high levels of accuracy and resolution. Especially in populations where uptake of smartphones is modest, this method has certain advantages over app-based solutions, with greater population coverage, but it is not an alternative to smartphone-based solutions used for contact tracing and quarantine monitoring.

163,Validation and clinical evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT),"To understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity after natural infection or vaccination, functional assays such as virus neutralizing assays are needed. So far, assays to determine SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies rely on cell-culture based infection assays either using wild type SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped viruses. Such assays are labour-intensive, require appropriate biosafety facilities and are difficult to standardize. Recently, a new surrogate virus neutralisation assay (sVNT) was described that uses the principle of an ELISA to measure the neutralization capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of the robustness, specificity and sensitivity on an extensive panel of sera from 269 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 259 unmatched samples collected before 2020 and compared it to cell-based neutralization assays. We found a high specificity of 99.2 (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) and overall sensitivity of 80.3 (95%CI: 74.9-84.8) for the sVNT. Clinical sensitivity increased between early (<14 days post symptom onset or post diagnosis, dpos/dpd) and late sera (>14 dpos/dpd) from 75.0 (64.7-83.2) to 83.1 (76.5-88.1). Also, higher severity was associated with an increase in clinical sensitivity. Upon comparison with cell-based neutralisation assays we determined an analytical sensitivity of 74.3 (56.4-86.9) and 98.2 (89.4-99.9) for titres [&ge;]10 to <40 and [&ge;]40 to <160, respectively. Only samples with a titre [&ge;]160 were always positive in the sVNT. In conclusion, the sVNT can be used as an additional assay to determine the immune status of COVID-19 infected of vaccinated individuals but its value needs to be assessed for the specific context of use.",Nicolas Veyrenche; Karine Bollore; Amandine Pisoni; Anne-Sophie Bedin; Anne-Marie Mondain; Jacques Ducos; Michel Segondy; Brigitte Montes; Patrick Pastor; David Morquin; Alain Makinson,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20191288""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20191288,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

Diagnostic laboratories are expected to provide appropriate testing with maximum accuracy. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is the diagnostic standard yet many commercial diagnostic kits have become available. However, only a handful of studies have reviewed their performance in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the overall analytical matrix including the extraction kit (BD MAX, Promega, Qiagen), the PCR instrument (Agilent Mx3005P, BD MAX, Qiagen Rotor-Gene, Roche Cobas z 480) and the RT-PCR assay (Altona Diagnostics, CerTest Biotec, R-Biopharm AG) using predefined samples from proficiency testing organizers. The greatest difference of the Ct values between the matrices was 9 cycles. One borderline sample could not be detected by 3 out of 12 analytical matrices and yielded a false negative result. We therefore conclude that diagnostic laboratories should take the complete analytical matrix in addition to the performance values published by the manufacturer for a respective RT-PCR kit into account. With limited resources laboratories have to validate a wide range of kits to determine appropriate analytical matrices for detecting SARS-CoV-2 reliably.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association of initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding. Method: All critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two intensive care units in March and April 2020 were eligible. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose of thromboprophylaxis: low (2500-4500 IU tinzaparin or 2500-5000 IU dalteparin), medium (>4500 IU but <175 IU/kilogram, kg, of body weight tinzaparin or >5000 IU but <200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose ([&ge;] 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or [&ge;]200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). Thromboprophylaxis dosage was based on local standardized recommendations, not on degree of critical illness or risk of thrombosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of death within 28 days from ICU admission. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body-mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, invasive respiratory support, and initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis. Results: A total of 152 patients were included; 67 received low, 48 medium, and 37 high dose thromboprophylaxis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Mortality was lower in high (13.5%) vs medium (25.0%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (38.8%) groups, p{equiv}0.02. The hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.13 - 0.87) among those who received high dose, respectively 0.88 (95% confidence intervals 0.43 - 1.83) among those who received medium dose, as compared with those who received low dose thromboprophylaxis. There were fewer thromboembolic events in the high (2.7%) vs medium (18.8%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (17.9%) groups, p{equiv}0.04, but no difference in the proportion of bleeding events, p{equiv}0.16.

Method: Data were from the national Understanding American Study, a probability-based Internet panel weighted to represent the U.S. population. Subjects (N=5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationship of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use and the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample. We examined the effect of working or studying from home as a moderator. Results: Twitter and Instagram users, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3 than non-users. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to the frequency of drinking at wave 1. The interaction between Twitter use and working or studying from home was statistically significant. The combination of being on Twitter and working or studying from home was associated with drinking more days a week. Conclusions: Exposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may contribute to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users, especially those sheltering at home.

Using Microfluidic Antibody Affinity Profiling (MAAP), we determined the aggregate affinities and concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma samples of 42 seropositive individuals, 23 of whom were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2-positive by PCR testing. We found that dissociation constants (Kd) of anti-RBD antibodies spanned more than two orders of magnitude from 80 pM to 25 nM, despite having similar antibody concentrations. Individual patients showed progressively higher antibody concentrations but constant Kd values, suggesting that affinities did not mature over time. 33 sera showed affinities higher than that of the CoV2 spike for its ACE2 receptor. Accordingly, addition of seropositive plasma to pre-formed spike-ACE2 receptor complexes led to their dissociation. Finally, we observed that the RBD of HKU1, OC43, and SARS-CoV coronaviruses, but not unrelated control proteins, were able to compete substantially with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in solution. Therefore, the affinity of total plasma immunoglobulins to SARS-CoV-2 is an indicator of the quality of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and may help select the most efficacious samples for therapeutic plasmapheresis.",Nicolas Veyrenche; Karine Bollore; Amandine Pisoni; Anne-Sophie Bedin; Anne-Marie Mondain; Jacques Ducos; Michel Segondy; Brigitte Montes; Patrick Pastor; David Morquin; Alain Makinson; Vincent Le Moing; Philippe Van De Perre; Vincent Foulongne; Edouard Tuaillon,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.20.20196907""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.20.20196907,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

SMRC technique allows robustly delimiting a given variable in dynamical systems. In particular, for the epidemiological problem addressed here, it can be used to compute day by day the contact rate reduction requirement in order to limit the intense care units occupancy to a given threshold. What is more, it could impose a given approaching rate to the health care system limits. Simulations are performed using the well-known SEIR model fitted to the Argentinian case to demonstrate what this control strategy suggests, while the effect of realistic period transitions between different confinement levels are also considered.",Nicolas Veyrenche; Karine Bollore; Amandine Pisoni; Anne-Sophie Bedin; Anne-Marie Mondain,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20166934""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20166934,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

172,A simplified approach to monitoring the COVID-19 epidemiologic situation using waste water analysis and its application in Russia,"The number of registered cases of COVID-19 is increasing in the world, and some countries are reporting a second wave of the pandemic. Accurate and real time information about epidemiological situation is therefore urgently needed for managing decisions in the countries, regions and municipalities which are affected. Massive testing of viral presence in human saliva, a smear from the nose, nasopharynx and / or oropharynx, bronchial lavage water obtained by fibrobronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage), as well as from (endo) tracheal, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, biopsy or autopsy material of the lungs, whole blood, serum or antibodies presence in blood cannot give relevant information about the COVID-19 infection rate in the community since simultaneous testing of the whole community is not technically possible, the information obtained in testing of specific groups is retarded and, in addition, such testing is expensive. The alternative to mass testing of the population is the testing of wastewater that could contain SARS-CoV-2 particles originating from excreta. Such testing has several limitations connected with the particularities of the testing procedure. In the present study, a modified approach for detection of COVID-19 infection rate using wastewater analysis has been developed. The approach includes i) the creation of a calibration curve on the basis of the serial dilution of excreta collected from people who are infected with COVID-19 and ii) the analysis of wastewater samples and their serial dilutions but the approach excludes usage of concentration techniques before wastewater sample analysis as well as usage of external control in RT-PCR reactions for calculation of numbers of viral particles. The minimum infection rate that can be detected using this approach is 0.01%. The approach developed was used to investigate wastewater from eleven sewage inspection chambers in the city of Kazan (Russia). It was demonstrated that the average infection rate of people using these sewers was over 0.4% in July 2020.",Nicolas Veyrenche; Karine Bollore; Amandine Pisoni; Anne-Sophie Bedin; Anne-Marie Mondain,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20197244""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20197244,2020-09-23,2020-09-23,,True

Despite administrative efforts at mitigation and preventive measures, the large congregation of students within close quarters has caused public health concerns. In this paper, we examine college reopenings' association with changes in human mobility within campuses and in COVID-19 incidence in the counties of the campuses, over a two-week period before and after college reopenings. To estimate the daily reproduction number (Rt), we used a Bayesian framework. Using a difference-in-differences design comparing areas with a college campus, before and after reopening, to areas without a campus, we find that after college reopenings for face-to-face instruction, COVID-19 incidence in the county increased on average by a statistically significant 0.024 per thousand residents, following increases in mobility on campus. Similarly, we estimated increased transmission locally after reopening, with a rising trend in Rt.

However, its impact on neurocognitive, psychiatric health and quality of life (QoL) in survivors after the acute phase is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate neurocognitive function, psychiatric symptoms, and QoL in COVID-19 survivors shortly after hospital discharge. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors followed-up for 2 months after discharge. A battery of standardized instruments evaluating neurocognitive function, psychiatric morbidity, and QoL (mental and physical components) was administered by telephone. Findings: Of the 229 screened patients, 179 were included in the final analysis. Among survivors, the prevalence of moderately impaired immediate verbal memory and learning was 38%, delayed verbal memory (11.8%), verbal fluency (34.6%), and working memory (executive function) (6.1%), respectively. Moreover, 58.7% of patients had neurocognitive impairment in at least one function. Rates of positive screening for anxiety were 29.6%, depression (26.8%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (25.1%) respectively. In addition, 39.1% of the patients had psychiatric morbidity. Low QoL for physical and mental components was detected in 44.1% and 39.1% of patients, respectively. Delirium and stress-related symptoms increased approximately 4-fold the odds of developing neurocognitive impairment. Female gender and neurocognitive impairment diagnosis were related with an increase of 2.5 and 4.56-fold odds respectively of psychiatric morbidity.

175,D-dimer dynamics in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: potential utility for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"Background: A higher incidence of thrombotic events, mainly pulmonary embolism (PE), has been reported in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objectives: To assess clinical and weekly laboratory differences in hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to occurrence of PE. Methods: This retrospective study included all consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiography for PE clinical suspicion. Clinical data and median blood test results distributed into weekly periods from COVID-19 symptoms onset were compared between PE and non-PE patients. Results: Ninety-two patients were included, 29 (32%) had PE. PE patients were younger (63.9 (SD13.7) vs 69.9 (SD12.5) years). Clinical symptoms and COVID-19 CT features were similar in both groups. PE was diagnosed after a mean of 20.0 (SD8.6) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Corticosteroid boluses were more frequently used in PE patients (62% vs. 43%). Median values [IQR] of D-dimer in PE vs non-PE patients were: week 2 (2010.7 [770.1-11208.9] vs 626.0 [374.0-2382.2]; p=0.04); 3 (3893.1 [1388.2-6694.0] vs 1184.4 [461.8-2447.8]; p=0.03); and 4 (2736.3 [1202.1-8514.1] vs 1129.1 [542.5-2834.6]; p=0.01). Median fold-increase of D-dimer between week 1 and 2 differed between groups (6.64 [3.02-23.05] vs 1.57 [0.64-2.71], p=0.003); ROC curve AUC was 0.879 (p=0.003) with a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 86% and 80%, respectively.

The scientific communitys massive response has resulted in a flood of experiments, analyses, hypotheses, and publications, especially in the field drug repurposing. However, many of the proposed therapeutic compounds obtained from SARS-CoV-2 specific assays are not in agreement and thus demonstrate the need for a singular source of COVID-19 related information from which a rational selection of drug repurposing candidates can be made. In this paper, we present the COVID-19 PHARMACOME, a comprehensive drug-target-mechanism graph generated from a compilation of several disease maps and experimental data focused on SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 pathophysiology. By applying a systematic approach, we were able to predict the effect of drug pairs on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

177,"Ruling In and Ruling Out COVID-19: Computing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Risk From Symptoms, Imaging and Test Data.","Background: Assigning meaningful probabilities of SARS CoV2 infection risk presents a diagnostic challenge across the continuum of care. Methods: We integrated patient symptom and test data using machine learning and Bayesian inference to quantify individual patient risk of SARS CoV 2 infection. We trained models with 100,000 simulated patient profiles based on thirteen symptoms, estimated local prevalence, imaging, and molecular diagnostic performance from published reports. We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID 19 compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over 14 days starting in March 2020. Results: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (78%) or cough (77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11) or hospital care (n=44). 51% (n=28) were female, 49% were age <60. Common comorbidities included diabetes (22%), hypertension (27%), cancer (16%) and cardiovascular disease (13%). 69% of these (n=38) were RT-PCR confirmed positive for SARS CoV2 infection, 11 had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis. Bayesian inference network, distance metric learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS CoV2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6 to 84.2%, specificities of 58.8 to 70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4 to 71.8%. After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices.

For precise policy making, accurate and efficient forecasts of confirmed cases and death counts are important. In this work, we used five different univariate time series models including; Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Nonparametric Autoregressive (NPAR) and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) models for forecasting confirmed, death and recovered cases. These models were applied to Pakistan COVID-19 data, covering the period from 10, March to 3, July 2020. To evaluate models accuracy, computed two standard mean errors such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The findings show that the time series models are useful in predicting COVID-19 confirmed, deaths and recovered cases. Furthermore, MA model outperformed the rest of all models for confirmed and deaths counts prediction, while ARMA is second best model. The SES model seems superior to other models for prediction of recovered counts, however MA is competitive.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a diagnosis strategy based on a combination of antigen and IgM/IgG serological RDTs. Methods: Plasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected between 14 March and 11 April 2020 at hospital admission from 45 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and 20 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) was assessed in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Coris Respi-Strip.

180,Uncovering clinical risk factors and prediction of severe COVID-19: A machine learning approach based on UK Biobank data,"Background: COVID-19 is a major public health concern. Given the extent of the pandemic, it is urgent to identify risk factors associated with severe disease. Accurate prediction of those at risk of developing severe infections is also important clinically. Methods: Based on the UK Biobank (UKBB data), we built machine learning(ML) models to predict the risk of developing severe or fatal infections, and to evaluate the major risk factors involved. We first restricted the analysis to infected subjects, then performed analysis at a population level, considering those with no known infections as controls. Hospitalization was used as a proxy for severity. Totally 93 clinical variables (collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak) covering demographic variables, comorbidities, blood measurements (e.g. hematological/liver and renal function/metabolic parameters etc.), anthropometric measures and other risk factors (e.g. smoking/drinking habits) were included as predictors. XGboost (gradient boosted trees) was used for prediction and predictive performance was assessed by cross-validation. Variable importance was quantified by Shapley values and accuracy gain. Shapley dependency and interaction plots were used to evaluate the pattern of relationship between risk factors and outcomes. Results: A total of 1191 severe and 358 fatal cases were identified. For the analysis among infected individuals (N=1747), our prediction model achieved AUCs of 0.668 and 0.712 for severe and fatal infections respectively. Since only pre-diagnostic clinical data were available, the main objective of this analysis was to identify baseline risk factors. The top five contributing factors for severity were age, waist-hip ratio(WHR), HbA1c, number of drugs taken(cnt_tx) and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. For prediction of mortality, the top features were age, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), urea and WHR. In subsequent analyses involving the whole UKBB population (N for controls=489987), the corresponding AUCs for severity and fatality were 0.669 and 0.749. The same top five risk factors were identified for both outcomes, namely age, cnt_tx, WC, WHR and cystatin C. We also uncovered other features of potential relevance, including testosterone, IGF-1 levels, red cell distribution width (RDW) and lymphocyte percentage. Conclusions: We identified a number of baseline clinical risk factors for severe/fatal infection by an ML approach. For example, age, central obesity, impaired renal function, multi-comorbidities and cardiometabolic abnormalities may predispose to poorer outcomes. The presented prediction models may be useful at a population level to help identify those susceptible to developing severe/fatal infections, hence facilitating targeted prevention strategies.

We utilized cost-effective, on-demand 3D printing (3DP) technology to produce critical components for a novel ventilator multiplexer system, Vent-Lock, to split one ventilator or anesthesia gas machine between two patients. FloRest, a novel 3DP flow restrictor, provides clinicians control of tidal volumes and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), using the 3DP manometer adaptor to monitor pressures. We tested the ventilator splitter circuit in simulation centers between artificial lungs and used an anesthesia gas machine to successfully ventilate two swines. As one of the first studies to demonstrate splitting one anesthesia gas machine between two swines, we present proof-of-concept of a de novo, closed, multiplexing system, with flow restriction for individualized patient therapy.

182,An improved method to estimate the effective reproduction number of the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from its application in Greece,"Introduction: Monitoring the time-varying effective reproduction number Rt is crucial for assessing the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. We present an improved method to estimate Rt and its application to routine surveillance data from Greece. Methods: Our method extends that of Cori et al (2013), adding Bayesian imputation of missing symptom onset dates, imputation of infection times using an external estimate of the incubation period, and an adjustment for reporting delay. To facilitate its use, we provide an R software package named ""bayEStim"". We applied the method to COVID-19 surveillance data from Greece, and examined the resulting Rt estimates in relation to control measures applied, in order to assess their effectiveness. We also associated Rt, as a measure of transmissibility, to population mobility as recorded in Google data and to ambient temperature. We used a serial interval between 4 and 7.5 days, and a median incubation period of 5.1 days. Results: In Greece Rt fell rapidly as the first control measures were introduced, dropping below 1 at least a week before a full lockdown came into effect. In mid-July Rt started increasing again, as increased mobility associated with tourism activity was observed. Each 10% of increase in relative mobility increased Rt by 8.1% (95% CrI 6.1-10.2%), whereas each unit celsius of temperature increase decreased Rt by 4.6% (95% CrI 5.4-13.7%). Conclusions: Mobility patterns significantly affect Rt. Most of the reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility in Greece occurred already before the lockdown, likely as a result of decreased population mobility. Lower viral transmissibility in summer does not appear sufficient to counterbalance the increased mobility due to tourism. Monitoring Rt is an essential component of COVID-19 surveillance, and it is crucial for correctly assessing the effect of control measures.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198028""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198028,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
183,Quantifying the Effects of Social Distancing on theSpread of COVID-19,"This paper studies the interplay between the social distancing and the spread of COVID-19 disease, a widely spread pandemic that has affected nearly most of the world population. Starting in China, the virus has reached the United States of America with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Even though it is not possible to eliminate the spread of the virus from the world or any other country, it might be possible to reduce its effect by decreasing the number of infected people. Implementing such policies needs a good understanding of the system dynamics, generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with complex and continuous feedback loops. As a result, we use agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis through applying some policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, providing good emergency and hospitalization strategies, and preventing traveling would lead to reducing the infection rates. Based on imperial college modeling studies that prove increasing levels of interventions could slow down the spread of disease and infection cases as much as possible, and taking into account that social distancing policy is considered to be the most important factor that was recommended to follow. Our proposed model is designed to test if increasing the social distancing policies strictness can slow down the spread of disease significantly or not, and find out what is the required safe level of social distancing. So, the model was run six times, with six different percentages of social distancing with keeping the other parameters levels fixed for all experiments. The results of our study show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, where the spread of disease and infection rates decrease once social distancing procedures are implemented at higher levels. Also, the behavior space tool was used to run ten experiments with different levels of social distancing, which supported the previous results. We concluded that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels led to significantly reduced infection rates, which result in decreasing deaths. Both types of experiments prove that infection rates are reduced dramatically when the level of social distancing intervention is implemented between 80% to 100%.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197996""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197996,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True

During the next two months, the number of cases grew gradually to 77 cases, followed by a rapid spread that has produced 3691 confirmed cases and 80 deaths by the end of July 2020. The turning point on 26 May 2020 was preceded three weeks earlier by the arrival of the first of a series of flights repatriating Libyans who became stranded abroad when air travel was suspended. In the first weeks of the surge, the number of cases was particularly high in the less densely populated southern region, raising questions about the implementation of social distancing and other protective measures in that region. The epidemic in Libya was modeled using the classical Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) mathematical model of infectious disease epidemics. Three scenarios were developed based on three estimates of the fraction of the population exposed to the disease (1.5, 2.5 and 3.5%). The modeling portrays the peak of the epidemic around early August and estimates that the number of deaths will flatten out around early November at between 250 and 600, depending on the parameter employed. More deaths than those estimated implies that is more widespread than assumed. Greater promotion of awareness and understanding of social distancing practices and their value is needed, particularly in the south, and better protection of the elderly should decrease mortality.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197822""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197822,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
185,A comparison of five epidemiological models for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India,"Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We compare five epidemiological models for forecasting and assessing the course of the pandemic. We compare how the models analyze case-recovery-death count data in India, the country with second highest reported case-counts in a world where a large proportion of infections remain undetected. A baseline curve-fitting model is introduced, in addition to three compartmental models: an extended SIR (eSIR) model, an expanded SEIR model developed to account for infectiousness of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases (SAPHIRE), another SEIR model to handle high false negative rate and symptom-based administration of tests (SEIR-fansy). A semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model developed at the Imperial College London (ICM) is also examined. Using COVID-19 data for India from March 15 to June 18 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from June 19 to July 18. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) and mean squared relative prediction error (MSRPE) for each of the five models. For active case counts, SEIR-fansy yields an SMAPE value of 0.72, and the eSIR model yields a value of 33.83. For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 1.76 for baseline model, 23.10 for eSIR, 2.07 for SAPHIRE and 3.20 for SEIR-fansy. For cumulative death counts, the SEIR-fansy model performs the best, with an SMAPE of 7.13, as compared to 26.30 for the eSIR model. Using Pearson correlation coefficient and Lin concordance correlation coefficient, for cumulative case counts, the baseline model exhibits highest correlation (both Pearson as well as Lin coefficients), while for cumulative death counts, projections from SEIR-fansy exhibit the best performance: For cumulative cases, correlation coefficients computed for the baseline model are 1 (Pearson) and 0.991 (Lin). For eSIR, those values are 0.985 (Pearson) and 0.316 (Lin). For SAPHIRE, we compute 1 (Pearson) and 0.975 (Lin). Finally, for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 1 (Pearson) and 0.965 (Lin). Similarly, for cumulative deaths, correlation coefficients computed for eSIR is 0.978 (Pearson) and 0.206 (Lin), and for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 0.999 (Pearson) and 0.742 (Lin). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) counts as well. We compute underreporting factors on two specific dates (June 30 and July 10) and note that on both dates, the SEIR-fansy model reports the highest underreporting factor for active cases (June 30: 6.10 and July 10: 6.24) and cumulative deaths (June 30: 3.62 and July 10: 3.99) for both dates, while the SAPHIRE model reports the highest underreporting factor for cumulative cases (June 30: 27.79 and July 10: 26.74).",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart; Eric Elguero; Oxana Vratskikh; Solene Denolly; Bertrand Boson,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198010""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198010,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True

187,Epidemiology of COVID-19 vs. Influenza: Differential Failure of COVID-19 Mitigation among Hispanics,"BACKGROUND: During the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly African-American or Hispanic communities were disproportionately impacted. We sought to better understand the epidemiology of COVID-19 among hospitalized Hispanic patients by comparing individual and census-tract level characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those diagnosed with influenza, another viral infection with respiratory transmission. We evaluated the temporal changes in epidemiology across race-ethnicity related to a shelter-in-place mandate. METHODS: We evaluated patients hospitalized at Cook County Health, the safety-net health system for the Chicago metropolitan area. Among self-identified hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared those with influenza (2019-2020 influenza season) to COVID-19 infection during March 16, 2020 through May 11, 2020. We used multivariable analysis to identify differences in individual and census-tract level characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, COVID-19 rapidly increased among Hispanics during promotion of social-distancing policies. Whereas non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be hospitalized for influenza, Hispanic patients predominated among COVID-19 infections (40% relative increase compared to influenza). In the comparative analysis of influenza and COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to reside in census tracts with higher proportions of residents with the following characteristics: Hispanic; no high school diploma; non-US citizen; limited English speaking ability; employed in manufacturing or construction; and, overcrowding. By multivariable analysis, Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza were more likely to be male (adjusted OR=1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9) or obese (aOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), and to reside in a census tract with [&ge;]40% of residents without a high-school diploma (aOR=2.5; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.8).

188,"COVID-19: Risks of Re-emergence, Re-infection, and Control Measures -- A Long Term Modelling Study","In this work we define a modified SEIR model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period, infections from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infected individuals, potential loss of acquired immunity, people's increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of vaccination as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions like social confinement. We estimate model parameters in three different scenarios - in Italy, where there is a growing number of cases and re-emergence of the epidemic, in India, where there are significant number of cases post confinement period and in Victoria, Australia where a re-emergence has been controlled with severe social confinement program. Our result shows the benefit of long-term confinement of 50% or above population and extensive testing. With respect to loss of acquired immunity, our model suggests higher impact for Italy. We also show that a reasonably effective vaccine with mass vaccination program can be successful in significantly controlling the size of infected population. We show that for India, a reduction in contact rate by 50% compared to a reduction of 10% in the current stage can reduce death from 0.0268% to 0.0141% of population. Similarly, for Italy we show that reducing contact rate by half can reduce a potential peak infection of 15% population to less than 1.5% of population, and potential deaths from 0.48% to 0.04%. With respect to vaccination, we show that even a 75% efficient vaccine administered to 50% population can reduce the peak number of infected populations by nearly 50% in Italy. Similarly, for India, a 0.056% of population would die without vaccination, while 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 30% population would bring this down to 0.036% of population, and 93.75% efficient vaccine given to 70% population would bring this down to 0.034%.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198051""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20198051,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
189,Age groups that sustain resurging COVID-19 epidemics in the United States,"Following initial declines, in mid 2020, a resurgence in transmission of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has occurred in the United States and parts of Europe. Despite the wide implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, it is still not known how they are impacted by changing contact patterns, age and other demographics. As COVID-19 disease control becomes more localised, understanding the age demographics driving transmission and how these impacts the loosening of interventions such as school reopening is crucial. Considering dynamics for the United States, we analyse aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals and link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. In contrast to previous approaches, we link mobility to mortality via age-specific contact patterns and use this rich relationship to reconstruct accurate transmission dynamics. Contrary to anecdotal evidence, we find little support for age-shifts in contact and transmission dynamics over time. We estimate that, until August, 63.4% [60.9%-65.5%] of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States originated from adults aged 20-49, while 1.2% [0.8%-1.8%] originated from children aged 0- 9. In areas with continued, community-wide transmission, our transmission model predicts that re-opening kindergartens and elementary schools could facilitate spread and lead to additional COVID-19 attributable deaths over a 90-day period. These findings indicate that targeting interventions to adults aged 20-49 are an important consideration in halting resurgent epidemics and preventing COVID-19-attributable deaths when kindergartens and elementary schools reopen.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart; Eric Elguero; Oxana Vratskikh; Solene Denolly; Bertrand Boson; Jessica Vanhomwegen; Meriadeg Ar Gouilh; Angeli Kodjo; Catherine Chirouze; Serge Rosolen; Vincent Legros; Eric M.

Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 is its Python interface, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart; Eric Elguero; Oxana Vratskikh; Solene Denolly; Bertrand Boson; Jessica Vanhomwegen; Meriadeg Ar Gouilh; Angeli Kodjo; Catherine Chirouze; Serge Rosolen; Vincent Legros; Eric M.

192,An automatic pipeline for the design of irreversible derivatives identifies a potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor.,"Designing covalent inhibitors is a task of increasing importance in drug discovery. Efficiently designing irreversible inhibitors, though, remains challenging. Here, we present covalentizer, a computational pipeline for creating irreversible inhibitors based on complex structures of targets with known reversible binders. For each ligand, we create a custom-made focused library of covalent analogs. We use covalent docking, to dock these tailored covalent libraries and to find those that can bind covalently to a nearby cysteine while keeping some of the main interactions of the original molecule. We found ~11,000 cysteines in close proximity to a ligand across 8,386 protein-ligand complexes in the PDB. Of these, the protocol identified 1,553 structures with covalent predictions. In prospective evaluation against a panel of kinases, five out of nine predicted covalent inhibitors showed IC50 between 155 nM - 4.2 M. Application of the protocol to an existing SARS-CoV-1 Mpro reversible inhibitor led to a new acrylamide inhibitor series with low micromolar IC50 against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The docking prediction was validated by 11 co-crystal structures. This is a promising lead series for COVID-19 antivirals.

Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were invited to participate in an online survey. which was released between 13th May and 24th June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received. Findings While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family's health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women's partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree.

195,COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritius: Logistic growth and SEIR modelling with quarantine and an effective reproduction number,"SUMMARY Background and Objectives The island of Mauritius experienced a COVID-19 outbreak from mid-March to end April 2020. The first three cases were reported on March 18 (Day 1) and the last locally transmitted case occurred on April 26 (Day 40). An island confinement was imposed on March 20 followed by a sanitary curfew on March 23. Supermarkets were closed as from March 25 (Day 8). There were a total of 332 cases including 10 deaths from Day 1 to Day 41. Control of the outbreak depended heavily on contact tracing, testing, quarantine measures and the adoption of personal protective measures (PPMs) such as social distancing, the wearing of face masks and personal hygiene by Mauritius inhabitants. Our objectives were to model and understand the evolution of the Mauritius outbreak using mathematical analysis, a logistic growth model and an SEIR compartmental model with quarantine and a reverse sigmoid effective reproduction number and to relate the results to the public health control measures in Mauritius. Methods The daily reported cumulative number of cases in Mauritius were retrieved from the Worldometer website at https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/mauritius/. A susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-removed (SEIQR) model was introduced and analytically integrated under the assumption that the daily incidence of infectious cases evolved as the derivative of the logistic growth function. The cumulative incidence data was fitted using a logistic growth model. The SEIQR model was integrated computationally with an effective reproduction number (R_e) varying in time according to a three-parameter reverse sigmoid model. Results were compared with the retrieved data and the parameters were optimised using the normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) as a comparative statistic. Findings A closed-form analytical solution was obtained for the time-dependence of the cumulative number of cases. For a small final outbreak size, the solution tends to a logistic growth. The cumulative number of cases was well described by the logistic growth model (NRMSE = 0.0276, R^2=0.9945) and by the SEIQR model (NRMSE = 0.0270, R^2=0.9952) with the optimal parameter values. The value of R_e on the day of the reopening of supermarkets (Day 16) was found to be approximately 1.6. Interpretation A mathematical basis has been obtained for using the logistic growth model to describe the time evolution of outbreaks with a small final outbreak size. The evolution of the outbreak in Mauritius was consistent with one modulated by a time-varying effective reproduction number resulting from the epidemic control measures implemented by Mauritius authorities and the PPMs adopted by Mauritius inhabitants. The value of R_e{approx}1.6 on the reopening of supermarkets on Day 16 was sufficient for the outbreak to grow to large-scale proportions in case the Mauritius population did not comply with the PPMs. However, the number of cases remained contained to a small number which is indicative of a significant contribution of the PPMs in the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Mauritius.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199364""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199364,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
196,Treatment of Moderate to Severe Respiratory COVID-19--A Cost-Utility Analysis,"Background: Due to COVID-19's significant morbidity and mortality, identifying the most cost-effective pharmacologic treatment strategy is critical. As such, we determined the most cost-effective strategy for moderate to severe COVID-19 respiratory infections using the United States health care system as a representative model. Methods: A decision analytic model modelled a base case scenario of a 60-year-old patient admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Patients requiring oxygen were considered moderate severity, and patients with severe COVID-19 required intubation with intensive care. Strategies modelled included giving remdesivir to all patients, remdesivir in severe infections, remdesivir in moderate infections, dexamethasone to all patients, dexamethasone in severe infections, remdesivir in moderate/dexamethasone in severe infections, and best supportive care. Data for the model came from the published literature. The time horizon was 1 year; no discounting was performed due to the short duration. The perspective was of the payer in the United States health care system. Results: Supportive care for moderate/severe COVID-19 cost $11,112.98/0.8256 QALY. Remdesivir in moderate/dexamethasone in severe infections was the most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,764.56/QALY gained compared to supportive care. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed remdesivir for moderate/dexamethasone for severe COVID-19 infection was most cost-effective in 88.6% of scenarios and dexamethasone in moderate-severe infections in 11.4% of scenarios. With lower willingness to pay thresholds ($250-$37,500), dexamethasone for severe infections was favoured. Conclusions: Remdesivir for moderate/dexamethasone for severe COVID-19 infections was the most cost-effective strategy.

197,The effect of ABO blood group and antibody class on the risk of COVID-19 infection and severity of clinical outcomes.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 22 million cases and caused immense burdens on governments and healthcare systems worldwide. Since its emergence in December 2019, research has been focused on ways to not only treat the infected but also identify those at risk and prevent spread. There is currently no known biological biomarker that can predict the risk of being infected. A growing set of studies have emerged that show an association between ABO blood group and the risk of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we used retrospective observational data in Bahrain to investigate the association between ABO blood group and risk of infection as well as susceptibility to a more severe ICU-requiring infection. We found that individuals with blood group B were at a higher risk of infection, while those with blood group AB were at a lower risk. No association was observed between blood group and the risk of a severe ICU-requiring COVID-19 infection. We extended the analysis to study the association by antibodies present; anti-a (blood groups B and O) and anti-b (blood groups A and O). Antibodies were not found to be associated with either risk of infection or susceptibility to severe infection.

Methods: One week after the announcement of the COVID-19 as a pandemic, in a global survey, 177 addiction medicine professionals described COVID-19-related health responses in their own 77 countries in terms of SUD treatment and harm reduction services. The health response is categorized around (1) managerial measures and systems, (2) logistics, (3) service providers, and (4) vulnerable groups. Results: Respondents from over 88% of countries reported that core medical and psychiatric care for SUDs had continued; however, only 56% of countries reported having had any business continuity plan, and 37.5% of countries reported shortages of methadone or buprenorphine supplies. Participants of 41% of countries reported partial discontinuation of harm-reduction services such as needle and syringe programs and condom distribution. 57% of overdose prevention interventions and 81% of outreach services also having been negatively impacted. Conclusions: Participants reported that SUD treatment and harm reduction services had been significantly impacted globally early during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our findings, we provide a series of recommendations to support countries to be prepared more efficiently for future waves or similar pandemics to 1) help policymakers generate business continuity plans, 2) maintain the use of evidence-based interventions for people with SUDs, 3) be prepared for adequate medication supplies, 4) integrate harm reduction programs with other treatment modalities and 5) have specific considerations for vulnerable groups such as immigrants and refugees.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart; Eric Elguero; Oxana Vratskikh; Solene Denolly; Bertrand Boson; Jessica Vanhomwegen; Meriadeg Ar Gouilh; Angeli Kodjo; Catherine Chirouze; Serge Rosolen; Vincent Legros; Eric M.

Yet, to date, there is no evidence of this disproportionate impact on non-national individuals, including economic migrants, short-term travellers, and refugees. Methods We analysed data from the Italian surveillance system of all COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive from the beginning of the outbreak (20th of February) to the 19th of July 2020. We used multilevel negative-binomial regression models to compare the case-fatality rate and the rate of admission to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) between Italian and non-Italian nationals. The analysis was adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, and period of diagnosis. Results We analysed 213,180 COVID-19 cases, including 15,974 (7.5%) non-Italian nationals. We found that, compared to Italian cases, non-Italian cases were diagnosed at a later date and were more likely to be hospitalised [(adjusted relative risk (ARR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-1.44)] and admitted to ICU (ARR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), with differences being more pronounced in those coming from countries with lower HDI. We also observed an increased risk of death in non-Italian cases from low-HDI countries (ARR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75). Conclusions A delayed diagnosis in non-Italian cases could explain their worse outcomes compared to Italian cases. Ensuring early access to diagnosis and treatment to non-Italians could facilitate the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and improve health outcomes in all people living in Italy, regardless of nationality.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart; Eric Elguero; Oxana Vratskikh; Solene Denolly; Bertrand Boson; Jessica Vanhomwegen; Meriadeg Ar Gouilh; Angeli Kodjo; Catherine Chirouze; Serge Rosolen; Vincent Legros; Eric M.

201,Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 circulation and diversity through community wastewater sequencing,"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has rapidly become a major global health problem for which public health surveillance is crucial to monitor virus spread. Given the presence of viral RNA in feces in around 40% of infected persons, wastewater-based epidemiology has been proposed as an addition to disease-based surveillance to assess the spread of the virus at the community level. Here we have explored the possibility of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of sewage samples to evaluate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level from routine wastewater testing, and compared these results with the virus diversity in patients from the Netherlands and Belgium. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of viruses belonging to the most prevalent clades (19A, 20A and 20B) in both countries. Clades 19B and 20C were not identified, while they were present in clinical samples during the same period. Low frequency variant (LFV) analysis showed that some known LFVs can be associated with particular clusters within a clade, different to those of their consensus sequences, suggesting the presence of at least 2 clades within a single sewage sample. Additionally, combining genome consensus and LFV analyses we found a total of 57 unique mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which have not been described before. In conclusion, this work illustrates how NGS analysis of wastewater can be used to approximate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in a community.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart; Eric Elguero; Oxana Vratskikh; Solene Denolly; Bertrand Boson; Jessica Vanhomwegen; Meriadeg Ar Gouilh; Angeli Kodjo; Catherine Chirouze; Serge Rosolen,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198838""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20198838,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
202,Factors associated with drinking behaviour during COVID-19 social distancing and lockdown among adults in the UK,"Abstract Aim: To assess what factors were associated with reported changes to usual alcohol drinking behaviour during the start of lockdown in the UK. Design: Online cross-sectional survey from 21st March to 4th April 2020. Setting: UK. Participants: 30,375 adults aged [&ge;]18y. Measurements: Changes in drinking over the past week, sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviours, stress about COVID-19, finances or boredom, recent drop in household income, key worker status, and health conditions. Findings: Of 22,113 drinkers (65.7% of analytic sample), 48.1% (95% CI=47.0-49.1%) reported drinking about the same as usual, 25.7% (24.8-26.6%) reported drinking less than usual, and 26.2% (25.4-27.1%) reported drinking more than usual over the past week. Drinking less than usual was independently associated with being younger (OR=0.88 [95% CI=0.83-0.93]), male (OR=0.76 [0.68-0.84]), of an ethnic minority (OR=0.76 [0.61-0.97]), low annual household income (OR=0.74 [0.66-0.83]), having diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 (OR=2.04 [1.72-2.41]), adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviours (OR=1.58 [1.08-2.32]), being significantly stressed about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (OR=1.26 [1.08-1.48]) and not being a key worker (OR=0.87 [0.76-0.99]). Drinking more than usual was independently associated with being younger (OR=0.73 [0.69-0.78]), female (OR=1.36 [1.22-1.51]), post-16 qualifications (OR=1.21 [1.04-1.40]), high annual household income (OR=1.43 [1.27-1.61]), being significantly stressed about catching (OR=1.22 [1.03-1.45]) or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (OR=1.28 [1.10-1.48]), being significantly stressed about finances (OR=1.43 [1.24-1.66]), and having a diagnosed anxiety disorder (OR=1.24 [1.05-1.46]). Conclusions: In a representative sample of adults in the UK, about half of drinkers reported drinking the same amount of alcohol as usual during the start of the COVID-19 related lockdown, with a quarter drinking more and a quarter drinking less than usual. Drinking more than usual was associated with being younger, female, high socioeconomic position, having an anxiety disorder, and being stressed about finances or COVID-19.

Viral cultures and sequence analysis demonstrate ongoing replication of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus for at least 119 days. The patient had three admissions related to COVID-19 over a four-month period and was treated twice with remdesivir and convalescent plasma with resolution of symptoms.

204,Aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and infection risk in indoor environments,"The role of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 viruses in airborne transmission of COVID-19 is debated. The transmitting aerosol particles are generated through the breathing and vocalization by infectious subjects. Some authors state that this represents the dominant route of spreading, while others dismiss the option. Public health organizations generally categorize it as a secondary transmission pathway. Here we present a simple, easy-to-use spreadsheet algorithm to estimate the infection risk for different indoor environments, constrained by published data on human aerosol emissions, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, infective dose and other parameters. We evaluate typical indoor settings such as an office, a classroom, a choir practice room and reception/party environments. These are examples, and the reader is invited to use the algorithm for alternative situations and assumptions. Our results suggest that aerosols from highly infective subjects can effectively transmit COVID-19 in indoor environments. This ""highly infective"" category represents about one fifth of the patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We find that ""super infective"" subjects, representing the top few percent of positive-tested ones, plus an unknown fraction of less, but still highly infective, high aerosol-emitting subjects, may cause COVID-19 clusters (>10 infections), e.g. in classrooms, during choir singing and at receptions. The highly infective ones also risk causing such events at parties, for example. In general, active room ventilation and the ubiquitous wearing of face masks (i.e. by all subjects) may reduce the individual infection risk by a factor of five to ten, similar to high-volume HEPA air filtering. The most effective mitigation measure studied is the use of high-quality masks, which can drastically reduce the indoor infection risk through aerosols.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart; Eric Elguero; Oxana Vratskikh; Solene Denolly; Bertrand Boson; Jessica Vanhomwegen; Meriadeg Ar Gouilh,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199489""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199489,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,True
205,"Sharing a household with children and risk of COVID-19: a study of over 300,000 adults living in healthcare worker households in Scotland","Background Children are relatively protected from novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). The reasons for this protection are not well understood but differences in the immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been implicated. If such differences are due to differential exposure to non-SARS-CoV-2 infectious agents, adults who are close contacts of children may partly share in this protection. Such a protective effect would have important implications for the lives of children, not least in terms of schooling. Methods Using a Scotland-wide record-linkage based occupational cohort comprising healthcare workers and members of their households, we examined whether sharing a household with young children (aged 0 to 11) attenuated the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19, and/or testing positive for COVID-19 infection of any severity (any case of Covid-19). All healthcare workers directly employed by the National health Service (NHS) in Scotland, or contracted to provide general practice services, were included. Outcome and covariate data were obtained via linkage to Scotland-wide microbiology, drug prescribing, hospitalisation and death data. Results 241,266 adults did not share a household with young children; 41,198, 23,783 and 3,850 shared a household with 1, 2 and 3 or more young children respectively. The risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 was lower in those with one child and lower still in those with two or more children, adjusting for age the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.83 per child (95% CI 0.70-0.99). On additionally adjusting for sex, socioeconomic deprivation, occupation, professional role, staff/non-staff status, the number of adults and adolescents in each household, and comorbidity, the HR was 0.89 per child (95% CI 0.74-1.06). An association of the same magnitude, but more precisely estimated, was obtained for any case of COVID-19 (fully adjusted model, HR per child 0.89; 95% CI 0.84-0.95). Conclusion Increased household exposure to young children was associated with an attenuated risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and appeared to also be associated with an attenuated risk of COVID-19 disease severe enough to require hospitalisation.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart; Eric Elguero; Oxana Vratskikh; Solene Denolly; Bertrand Boson; Jessica Vanhomwegen; Meriadeg Ar Gouilh; Angeli Kodjo; Catherine Chirouze; Serge Rosolen; Vincent Legros; Eric M.

206,AI-guided discovery of the invariant host response to viral pandemics,"We sought to define the host immune response, a.k.a, the ""cytokine storm"" that has been implicated in fatal COVID-19 using an AI-based approach. Over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral pandemics were analyzed to extract a 166-gene signature using ACE2 as a  seed gene; ACE2 was rationalized because it encodes the receptor that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into host cells. Surprisingly, this 166-gene signature was conserved in all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, and a subset of 20-genes classified disease severity, inspiring the nomenclatures ViP and severe-ViP signatures, respectively. The ViP signatures pinpointed a paradoxical phenomenon wherein lung epithelial and myeloid cells mount an IL15 cytokine storm, and epithelial and NK cell senescence and apoptosis determines severity/fatality. Precise therapeutic goals were formulated and subsequently validated in high-dose SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters using neutralizing antibodies that abrogate SARS-CoV-2*ACE2 engagement. IL15/IL15RA were elevated in the lungs of patients with fatal disease, and plasma levels of the cytokine tracked with disease severity. Thus, the ViP signatures provide a quantitative and qualitative framework for titrating the immune response in viral pandemics and may serve as a powerful unbiased tool to rapidly assess disease severity and vet candidate drugs.

We here evaluated the efficiency of UV-C irradiation to inactivate surface dried SARS-CoV-2. Drying for two hours did not have a major impact on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that exhaled virus in droplets or aerosols stays infectious on surfaces at least for a certain amount of time. Strikingly, short exposure of high titer surface dried virus (3*10^6 IU/ml) with UV-C light (0.66 mJ/cm2) resulted in a total reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Together, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated by relatively low doses of UV-C irradiation. Hence, UV-C treatment is an effective non-chemical possibility to decontaminate surfaces from high-titer infectious SARS-CoV-2.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308098""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308098,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,False
208,Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 by healthy and sick dogs during COVID-19 pandemic in Spain.,"COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease originated by SARS-CoV-2. Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 are being reported during last months, and also an increase of severe lung pathologies in domestic dogs has been detected by veterinarians in Spain. Therefore it is necessary to describe the pathological processes in those animals that show symptoms similar to those described in humans affected by COVID-19. The potential for companion animals contributing to the continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread is an urgent issue to be considered.

Forty animals with pulmonary pathologies were studied by chest X-ray, ultrasound study, and computed tomography. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swab were analyzed to detect canine pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Twenty healthy dogs living in SARS-CoV-2 positive households were included. Immunoglobulin detection by different immunoassays was performed. Our findings show that sick dogs presented severe alveolar or interstitial pattern, with pulmonary opacity, parenchymal abnormalities, and bilateral lesions. Forty dogs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 but Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 26 of 33 dogs. Five healthy and one pathological dog presented IgG against SARS-CoV-2.

Here we report that despite detecting dogs with IgG -SARS-CoV-2, we never obtained a positive RT-qPCR, not even in dogs with severe pulmonary disease; suggesting that even in the case of a canine infection transmission would be unlikely. Moreover, dogs living in COVID-19 positive households could have been more exposed to be infected during outbreaks.",Matthieu Fritz; Beatrice Rosolen; Emilie Krafft; Pierre Becquart; Eric Elguero; Oxana Vratskikh; Solene Denolly; Bertrand Boson; Jessica Vanhomwegen; Meriadeg Ar Gouilh; Angeli Kodjo; Catherine Chirouze,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308023""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308023,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,False

A long-standing question in the field has been what the protonation states of the ionizable residues in the substrate-binding active site cavity are. Here, we present the room-temperature neutron structure of 3CL Mpro from SARS-CoV-2, which allows direct determination of hydrogen atom positions and, hence, protonation states. The catalytic site natively adopts a zwitterionic reactive state where His41 is doubly protonated and positively charged, and Cys145 is in the negatively charged thiolate state. The neutron structure also identified the protonation states of other amino acid residues, mapping electrical charges and intricate hydrogen bonding networks in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro active site cavity and dimer interface. This structure highlights the ability of neutron protein crystallography for experimentally determining protonation states at near-physiological temperature - the critical information for structure-assisted and computational drug design.",Akira Takagi; Masanori Matsui; Pietro Fontana; Setu Vora; Ying Zhang; Tian-Min Fu; Judy Lieberman,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308668""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308668,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,False
211,Bat and pangolin coronavirus spike glycoprotein structures provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution,"In recognizing the host cellular receptor and mediating fusion of virus and cell membranes, the spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses is the most critical viral protein for cross-species transmission and infection. Here we determined the cryo-EM structures of the spikes from bat (RaTG13) and pangolin (PCoV_GX) coronaviruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2. All three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of these two spike trimers are in the ""down"" conformation, indicating they are more prone to adopt this receptor-binding inactive state. However, we found that the PCoV_GX, but not the RaTG13, spike is comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 spike in binding the human ACE2 receptor and supporting pseudovirus cell entry. Through structure and sequence comparisons, we identified critical residues in the RBD that underlie the different activities of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX/SARS-CoV-2 spikes and propose that N-linked glycans serve as conformational control elements of the RBD. These results collectively indicate that strong RBD-ACE2 binding and efficient RBD conformational sampling are required for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to gain highly efficient infection.",Akira Takagi; Masanori Matsui; Pietro Fontana; Setu Vora; Ying Zhang; Tian-Min Fu; Judy Lieberman; Hao Wu; James Szymanski,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.307439""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.307439,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,False

Neutralizing binding molecules such as antibodies or derivatives thereof have become important tools for acute treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, such binders provide the unique possibility to monitor the emergence and presence of a neutralizing immune response in infected or vaccinated individuals. Here we describe a set of 11 unique nanobodies (Nbs), originated from an immunized alpaca which bind with high affinities to the glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor domain (RBD). Using a multiplex in vitro binding assay we showed that eight of the selected Nbs effectively block the interaction between RBD, S1-domain and homotrimeric Spike protein with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the viral docking site on human cells. According to competitive binding analysis and detailed epitope mapping, we grouped all Nbs blocking the RBD:ACE2 interaction in three distinct Nb-Sets and demonstrated their neutralizing effect with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range in a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Tested Nb combinations from different sets showed substantially lower IC50 values in both functional assays indicating a profound synergistic effect of Nbs simultaneously targeting different epitopes within the RBD. Finally, we applied the most potent Nb combinations in a competitive multiplex binding assay which we termed NeutrobodyPlex and detected a neutralizing immune response in plasma samples of infected individuals. We envisage that our Nbs have a high potential for prophylactic as well as therapeutic options and provide a novel approach to screen for a neutralizing immune response in infected or vaccinated individuals thus helping to monitor the immune status or to guide vaccine design.",Akira Takagi; Masanori Matsui; Pietro Fontana; Setu Vora; Ying Zhang; Tian-Min Fu; Judy Lieberman; Hao Wu; James Szymanski; Pippa Corrie; Yimin Tong; Jin Zhong; Youhua Xie; Xinquan Wang; Zhenghong Yuan; Dongming Zhou; Rong Zhang; Qiang Ding; Kristen J Brennand; Katherine H Hullsiek,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308338""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.308338,2020-09-22,2020-09-22,,False

A cell signature associating S100A9/calprotectin-producing CD169pos monocytes, plasmablasts, and Th1 cells was specifically found in COVID-19posARDSpos, unlike COVID-19negARDSpos patients. Moreover, this signature was shared by COVID-19posARDSneg patients, suggesting severe COVID-19 patients, whatever they experienced or not ARDS, displayed similar immune dysfunctions. We also showed an increase in CD14posHLA-DRlow and CD14lowCD16pos monocytes correlated to the occurrence of adverse events during ICU stay.

214,"Knowledge, attitudes and practices of COVID 19 among Medical Laboratory Professionals in Zambia","Background: COVID-19 is a novel disease that has spread to nearly every country worldwide. Medical laboratory professionals are key in the fight against COVID-19 as they provide confirmatory diagnosis which is the main basis upon which cases are identified and clinical management instituted. Lack of knowledge, poor attitude and unsafe laboratory practices could have negative implications towards the control of COVID-19. We conducted a quick online questionnaire to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of medical laboratory personnel regarding COVID-19 in Zambia. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study among medical laboratory professionals in Zambia from 10th to 29th June, 2020. Data were collected using google forms and exported to SPSS version 23 for statistical analysis. Independent predictors of COVID-19 knowledge and practices were determined. Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals are reported. Results: A total of 208 medical laboratory professionals participated in the study. There were more males (58.2%) than females. The majority of respondents had good knowledge (84.1%) and practice (75%) regarding COVID-19. Less than half (n=97, 46.6%) reported willingness to participate in a vaccination program. Predictors of good knowledge included; having a Bachelors degree (AOR: 5.0, CI: 1.15-23.9) and having prior COVID-19 related training (AOR: 8.83, CI: 2.03-38.4).

This cross-sectional study investigated mental distress among HCWs during the early phase of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Method: 140 HCWs of a tertiary care hospital in India were assessed for perceived stress and insomnia. A factor analysis with principal component method reduced these questions to four components which were categorized as insomnia, Stress-related Anxiety, Stress-related Irritability, and Stress-related Hopelessness. Further statistical analyses were done on these factor scores to identify the predictors and investigate the differences between the different categories of HCWs. Result: Doctors were the most anxious among the HCWs. Both doctors and nurses perceived a greater level of irritability than the other HCWs.

216,Why the COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic stressor,"The COVID-19 pandemic does not fit into prevailing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) models, or diagnostic criteria, yet emerging research shows traumatic stress symptoms as a result of this ongoing global stressor. Current pathogenic event models focus on past, and largely direct, trauma exposure to certain kinds of life-threatening events. Nevertheless, among a sample of online participants (N = 1,040) in five western countries, we found participants had PTSD-like symptoms for events that had not happened and when participants had been directly (e.g., contact with virus) or indirectly exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., via media). Moreover, 13.2% of our sample were likely PTSD-positive, despite types of COVID-19 ""exposure"" (e.g., lockdown) not fitting DSM-5 criteria. The emotional impact of ""worst"" experienced/anticipated events best predicted PTSD-like symptoms.

217,Impact of false negative results of RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 case count as applied to Mexico,"Underestimation of the number of cases during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a constant concern worldwide. Case confirmation is based on identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in clinical samples. However, these tests have suboptimal sensitivity, especially during the early and late course of infection. Using open data, we estimated that among 1 343 730 people tested in Mexico since February 27th, there were 838 377 (95% CL 734 605 - 1 057 164) cases, compared with 604 376 considering only positive tests. ICU admissions and deaths were around 16% and 9% higher than reported. Thus, we show that accounting for the sensitivity of SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests is a simple way to improve estimations for the true number of COVID-19 cases in tested people, particularly in high-prevalence populations. This could aid to better inform public health measures and reopening policies.",Akira Takagi; Masanori Matsui; Pietro Fontana,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20197038""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20197038,2020-09-21,2020-09-21,,True
218,Initial Model for USA CoVID-19 Resurgence,"Early CoVID-19 growth obeys: N{t*}=NI exp[+Ko t* ], with Ko=[(ln2)/(tdbl)], where tdbl is the pandemic growth doubling time. Given N{t*}, the daily number of new CoVID-19 cases is {rho}{t*} = dN{t*}/d{t*}. Implementing society-wide Social Distancing increases the tdbl doubling time, and a linear function of time for tdbl was used in our Initial Model: No[t] = 1 exp[+KA t / (1 + {gamma}o t) ] = eGo exp(-Zo[t] ) , to describe these changes, where the [t]-axis is time-shifted from the t*-axis, back to the pandemic start, and Go = [ KA / {gamma}o ]. While this No[t] successfully modeled the USA CoVID-19 progress from 3/2020 to 6/2020, this equation could not easily model some quickly decreasing {rho}[t] cases (""fast pandemic shutoff""), indicating that a second process was involved. This situation was most evident in the initial CoVID-19 data from China, South Korea, and Italy. Modifying Zo[t] to allow exponential cutoffs: Zo[t] {equiv} +[Go / (1+{gamma}o t)] [exp(-{delta}ot)] = Zo[t] exp(-{delta}ot) , NA[t] = eGo exp(-ZA[t]) , resulted in an Enhanced Initial Model (EIM) that significantly improved data fits for these cases. After 6/2020, many regions of the USA ""opened up"", loosening their Social Distancing requirements, which led to a sudden USA CoVID-19 Resurgence. Extrapolating the USA No[t] 3/2020-6/2020 results to 9/2020 as an Initial Model Baseline (IMB), and subtracting this IMB from the newer USA data gives a Resurgence Only function, which is analyzed here. This USA CoVID-19 Resurgence function differs significantly from the No[t] IMB functional form, but it was well-modeled by the NA[t] fast pandemic shutoff function. These results indicate that: (a) the gradual increase in tdbl doubling time from society-wide shut-downs is likely due to eliminating of a large number of population gathering points that could have enabled CoVID-19 spread; and (b) having a non-zero {delta}o fast pandemic shutoff is likely due to more people wearing masks more often [with 12 Figures].",Akira Takagi,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20196063""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20196063,2020-09-21,2020-09-21,,True
219,"How super-spreader cities, highways, hospital bed availability, and dengue fever influenced the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil","Although its international airports served as the country's main entry points for SARS-CoV-2, the factors driving the uneven geographic spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Brazil remain largely unknown. Here we show that four major factors likely accounted for the entire dynamics of COVID-19 in Brazil. Mathematical modeling revealed that, initially, the ""super-spreading"" city of Sao Paulo accounted for roughly 80% of the case spread in the entire country. During the first 3 months of the epidemic, by adding only 16 other spreading cities, we accounted for 98-99% of the cases reported in Brazil at the time. Moreover, 26 of the major Brazilian federal highways accounted for about 30% of SARS-CoV-2's case spread. As cases accumulated rapidly in the Brazilian countryside, the distribution of COVID-19 deaths began to correlate with a third parameter: the geographic distribution of the country's hospital intensive care unit (ICU) beds, which is highly skewed towards state capitals where the epidemic began. That meant that severely ill patients living in the countryside had to be transported to state capitals to access ICU beds where they often died, creating a ""boomerang effect"" that contributed to the skew of the geographic distribution of COVID-19 deaths. Finally, we discovered that the geographic distribution of dengue fever, amounting to more than 3.5 million cases from January 2019 to July 2020, was highly complementary to that of COVID-19. This was confirmed by the identification of significant negative correlations between COVID-19's incidence, infection growth rate, and mortality to the percentage of people with antibody (IgM) levels for dengue fever in each of the country's states. No such correlations were observed when IgM data for chikungunya virus, which is transmitted by the same mosquito vector as dengue, was used. Thus, states in which a large fraction of the population had contracted dengue fever in 2019-2020 reported lower COVID-19 cases and deaths, and took longer to reach exponential community transmission, due to slower SARS-CoV-2 infection growth rates. This inverse correlation between COVID-19 and dengue fever was further observed in a sample of countries around Asia and Latin America, as well as in islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This striking finding raises the intriguing possibility of an immunological cross-reactivity between DENV serotypes and SARS-CoV-2. If proven correct, this hypothesis could mean that dengue infection or immunization with an efficacious and safe dengue vaccine could produce some level of immunological protection for SARS-CoV-2, before a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 becomes available.",Akira Takagi; Masanori Matsui; Pietro Fontana; Setu Vora,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197749""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197749,2020-09-21,2020-09-21,,True
220,COVID-19 herd immunity in the Brazilian Amazon,"The herd immunity threshold is the proportion of a population that must be immune to an infectious disease, either by natural infection or vaccination such that, in the absence of additional preventative measures, new cases decline and the effective reproduction number falls below unity. This fundamental epidemiological parameter is still unknown for the recently-emerged COVID-19, and mathematical models have predicted very divergent results. Population studies using antibody testing to infer total cumulative infections can provide empirical evidence of the level of population immunity in severely affected areas. Here we show that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Manaus, located in the Brazilian Amazon, increased quickly during March and April and declined more slowly from May to September. In June, one month following the epidemic peak, 44% of the population was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, equating to a cumulative incidence of 52%, after correcting for the false-negative rate of the antibody test. The seroprevalence fell in July and August due to antibody waning. After correcting for this, we estimate a final epidemic size of 66%. Although non-pharmaceutical interventions, plus a change in population behavior, may have helped to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Manaus, the unusually high infection rate suggests that herd immunity played a significant role in determining the size of the epidemic.",Akira Takagi; Masanori Matsui; Pietro Fontana; Setu Vora; Ying Zhang; Tian-Min Fu; Judy Lieberman; Hao Wu; James Szymanski; Pippa Corrie; Yimin Tong; Jin Zhong; Youhua Xie; Xinquan Wang; Zhenghong Yuan; Dongming Zhou; Rong Zhang; Qiang Ding; Kristen J Brennand; Katherine H Hullsiek; David R Boulware; SARAH M LOFGREN; Martirene A da Silva; Brian Custer; Manoel Barral-Netto; Moritz Kraemer; Rafael HM Pererira; Oliver G Pybus; Michael P Busch; Márcia C Castro; Christopher Dye; Vitor H Nascimento; Nuno R Faria; Ester C Sabino,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20194787""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20194787,2020-09-21,2020-09-21,,True

We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high-risk of exposure. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with Covid-19, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, Covid-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine 400mg once weekly or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable Covid-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole blood concentrations. Results: We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of which 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of Covid-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events per person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events per person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events per person-year with placebo. For once weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16; P=0.18) and for twice weekly was 0.74 (95%CI 0.46 to 1.19; P=0.22) as compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng/mL (IQR, 82-120) with once-weekly and 200 ng/mL (IQR, 159-258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed Covid-19 (154 ng/mL) versus participants without Covid-19 (133 ng/mL; P=0.08).

222,Comparison of COVID-19 outcomes among shielded and non-shielded populations: A general population cohort study of 1.3 million,"Background Shielding (extended self-isolation) of people judged, a priori, to be at high-risk from COVID-19 has been used by some countries to protect the individuals and reduce demand on health services. It is unclear how well this strategy works in either regard. Methods A general population study was conducted using linked primary care, prescribing, laboratory, hospital and death records up to end of May 2020. Poisson regression models and population attributable fractions were used to compare COVID-19 outcomes by overall risk category, and individual risk criteria: confirmed infection, hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, population mortality and case-fatality. Results Of the 1.3 million population, 32,533 (2.47%) had been advised to shield, a further 347,374 (26.41%) were classified as moderate risk. Testing for COVID-19 was more common in the shielded (6.75%) and moderate (1.99%) than low (0.72%) risk categories. Referent to low-risk, the shielded group had higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 7.91, 95% 7.01-8.92), case-fatality (RR 5.19, 95% CI 4.12-6.53) and population mortality (RR 48.64, 95% 37.23-63.56). The moderate risk had intermediate risk of confirmed infection (RR 4.11, 95% CI 3.82-4.42) and population mortality (RR 26.10, 95% CI 20.89-32.60), but had comparable case-fatality (RR 5.13, 95% CI 4.24-6.21) to the shielded, and accounted for a higher proportion of deaths (PAF 75.27% vs 13.38%). Age [&ge;]70 years made the largest contribution to deaths (49.53%) and was associated with an 8-fold risk of infection, 7-fold case-fatality and 74-fold mortality.

224,Common genetic variation in humans impacts in vitro susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The host response to SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrates significant inter-individual variability. In addition to showing more disease in males, the elderly, and individuals with underlying co-morbidities, SARS-CoV-2 can seemingly render healthy individuals with profound clinical complications. We hypothesize that, in addition to viral load and host antibody repertoire, host genetic variants also impact vulnerability to infection. Here we apply human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models and CRISPR-engineering to explore the host genetics of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs4702), common in the population at large, and located in the 3UTR of the protease FURIN, impacts alveolar and neuron infection by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Thus, we provide a proof-of-principle finding that common genetic variation can impact viral infection, and thus contribute to clinical heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2.

However, previous methods for detecting recombination and reassortment events cannot handle the computational requirements of analyzing tens of thousands of genomes, a scenario that has now emerged in the effort to track the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, the low divergence of near-identical genomes sequenced in short periods of time presents a statistical challenge not addressed by available methods. In this work we present Bolotie, an efficient method designed to detect recombination and reassortment events between clades of viral genomes. We applied our method to a large collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and discovered hundreds of isolates that are likely of a recombinant origin. In cases where raw sequencing data was available, we were able to rule out the possibility that these samples represented co-infections by analyzing the underlying sequence reads.

226,Baseline T cell immune phenotypes predict virologic and disease control upon SARS-CoV infection,"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes in humans, from asymptomatic or mild disease to severe disease that can require mechanical ventilation. An incomplete understanding of immune correlates of protection represents a major barrier to the design of vaccines and therapeutic approaches to prevent infection or limit disease. This deficit is largely due to the lack of prospectively collected, pre-infection samples from indiviuals that go on to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we utilized data from a screen of genetically diverse mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) infected with SARS-CoV to determine whether circulating baseline T cell signatures are associated with a lack of viral control and severe disease upon infection. SARS-CoV infection of CC mice results in a variety of viral load trajectories and disease outcomes. Further, early control of virus in the lung correlates with an increased abundance of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells and regulatory T cells prior to infections across strains. A basal propensity of T cells to express IFNg and IL17 over TNFa also correlated with early viral control. Overall, a dysregulated, pro-inflammatory signature of circulating T cells at baseline was associated with severe disease upon infection. While future studies of human samples prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 are required, our studies in mice with SARS-CoV serve as proof of concept that circulating T cell signatures at baseline can predict clinical and virologic outcomes upon SARS-CoV infection. Identification of basal immune predictors in humans could allow for identification of individuals at highest risk of severe clinical and virologic outcomes upon infection, who may thus most benefit from available clinical interventions to restrict infection and disease.

Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and unbinds last from ACE2 under force.

CR3022 is a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody to a highly conserved epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein that can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but with lower affinity. Using x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and binding experiments, we illustrate that of four amino acid differences in the CR3022 epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a single mutation P384A fully determines the affinity difference. CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but the increased affinity to SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant now enables neutralization with a similar potency to SARS-CoV. We further investigated CR3022 interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein by negative-stain EM and cryo-EM. Three CR3022 Fabs bind per trimer with the RBD observed in different up-conformations due to considerable flexibility of the RBD.

We and others have previously shown that ACE2 orthologs from New World monkey, koala and mouse cannot interact with SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry, and this defect can be restored by humanization of the restrictive residues in New World monkey ACE2. To better understand the genetic determinants behind the ability of ACE2 orthologs to support viral entry, we compared koala and mouse ACE2 sequences with that of human and identified the key residues in koala and mouse ACE2 that restrict viral receptor activity.

After detailed studies on the characteristics of the SIR model for the various parameter dependencies with respect to such as the outing restriction (lockdown) ratio and vaccination rate, we have finally noticed that the second term (isolation term) in the differential equation of the number of the infected is quite similar to the ""helium ash particle loss term"" in deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear fusion. Based on this analogy, we have found that isolation of the infected is not actively controlled in the SIR model. Then we introduce the isolation control time parameter q and have studied its effect on this pandemic. Required isolation time to terminate the COVID-19 can be estimated by this proposed method. To show this isolation control effect, we choose Tokyo for the model calculation because of high population density. We determine the reproduction number and the isolation ratio in the initial uncontrolled phase, and then the future number of the infected is estimated under various conditions. If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3~8 days by widely performed testing, this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination. If the mild outing restriction and vaccination are taken together, the isolation control time can be longer. We consider this isolation time control might be the only solution to overcome the pandemic when vaccine is not available.",Akira Takagi; Masanori Matsui,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197723""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197723,2020-09-20,2020-09-20,,True
233,SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody prevalence among UK staff working with cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Background International guidelines for testing potentially immunosuppressed cancer patients receiving non-surgical anticancer therapies for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are currently lacking. The value of routinely testing staff treating cancer patients is not known. Methods: Patient-facing oncology department staff at work during the COVID-19 pandemic consented to have a nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 antigen test by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and blood tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using a laboratory Luminex-based assay and a rapid point-of-care (POC) assay on 2 occasions 28 days apart in June and July 2020. Results 434 participants were recruited: nurses (58.3%), doctors (21.2%), radiographers (10.4%) and administrators (10.1%). 82% were female; median age 40-years (range 19-66). 26.3% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1.4% tested PCR-positive prior to June 2020. All were PCR-negative at both study day 1 and 28. 18.4% were SARS-CoV-2 sero-positive on day 1 by Luminex, of whom 42.5% also tested positive by POC. 47.5% of Luminex sero-positives had antibodies to both nucleocapsid (N) and surface (S) antigens. Nurses (21.3%) and doctors (17.4%) had higher prevalence trends of Luminex sero-positivity compared with administrators (13.6%) and radiographers (8.9%) (p=0.2). 38% of sero-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a 1.9-fold higher odds than sero-negative participants (p=0.01). 400 participants re-tested on day 28: 13.3% were Luminex sero-positive of whom 92.5% were previously positive and 7.5% newly positive. Nurses (16.5%) had the highest seroprevalence trend amongst staff groups (p=0.07). 32.5% of day 1 sero-positives became sero-negative by day 28: the majority being previously reactive to the N-antigen only (p<0.0001).

235,SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold at hospital admission associated with Patient Mortality,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cycle threshold (Ct) has been suggested as an approximate measure of initial viral burden. The relationship of initial Ct at hospitalization and patient mortality has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective study of all SARS-CoV-2 positive, hospitalized patients from 3/26/2020 to 8/5/2020 who had SARS CoV-2 Ct data within 48 hours of admission (n=1044). Only patients with complete survival data discharged (n=774) or died in hospital (n=270), were included in our analysis. Laboratory, demographic, and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to examine the relationship of patient mortality with Ct values while adjusting for established risk factors. Ct values were analyzed both as continuous variables and subdivided into quartiles to better illustrate their relationship with outcomes, and other covariates. Cumulative incidence curves were created to assess whether there was a survival difference in the setting of the competing risks of death versus patient discharge. In this cohort the mean Ct at admission was higher for survivors (28.6, SD=5.8) compared to non-survivors (24.8, SD=6.0, P<0.001). Patients with a lower Ct value on admission were found to have a higher odds ratio (0.91, CI 0.89-0.94, p<0.001) of in hospital mortality after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and history of hypertension and diabetes. Patients with Ct values in 3rd Quartile (Ct 27.4-32.8) and 4th Quartile (Ct >32.9) have a lower odds of in-hospital death (P<0.001) in comparison to the 1st Quartile. On comparing between Ct quartiles, the mortality, BMI and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were significantly different (p<0.05) between the groups. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and discharge was found to differ between Ct quartiles (Grays Test P<0.001 for both.) Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 Ct at admission was found to be an independent predictor of in patient mortality.

Comparing mortality trends among dialysis patients in the eight months around the lockdown with the previous year, we document a 64% increase in mortality between March and May 2020 and an estimated 22-25% total excess mortality through July 2020. The mortality increase is greater among females and disadvantaged groups. Barriers to transportation and disruptions in hospital services appear to be the main drivers of increased morbidity and mortality.

237,Rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19: Perceptions of postgraduate dental learners and instructors,"Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19 necessitated abrupt transition from on campus, face-to-face sessions to online, distance learning in higher education institutions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of postgraduate dental learners and instructors about the transition to distance learning, including the changes to the learning and teaching and its efficaciousness. A mixed-methods approach to research was utilized. All the instructors and postgraduate learners were invited to participate in the online survey. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential analyses on SPSS for Windows version 25.0, and for the responses to the open-ended questions, multi-staged Thematic Analysis was utilized. Both groups of stakeholders: learners and instructors, were quite satisfied with the rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19. Instructors were significantly more satisfied than the learners. The stakeholders adapted well to the change. The perception of the stakeholders regarding the case-based scenarios significantly influenced their level of satisfaction. As perceived by the stakeholders, the transition to distance learning entailed advantages and challenges. Going through the experience equipped the stakeholders with lessons learned and enabled them to develop informed opinions of how best to sustain learning and teaching irrespective of how matters unfold in relation to the pandemic. In conclusion, the worldwide dental education community faced unprecedented challenges due to the onset of COVID-19. Yet, in the grand scheme of things, it is important for decision-makers not to miss-out on the worthwhile opportunities, inherent in the experience, to reinforce curriculums, and maximize the learning and teaching.",Akira Takagi; Masanori Matsui; Pietro Fontana; Setu Vora; Ying Zhang,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197830""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.19.20197830,2020-09-20,2020-09-20,,True
238,SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 suppresses host but not viral translation through a bipartite mechanism,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that underlies the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to disable various features of host immunity and cellular defense. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is known to inhibit host protein translation and could be a target for antiviral therapy against COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents this translational blockage for the production of its own proteins is an open question. Here, we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its C-terminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5 UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1. Thus, our data provide a comprehensive view on how Nsp1 switches infected cells from host mRNA translation to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation, and that Nsp1 and 5 UTR may be targeted for anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.",Akira Takagi; Masanori Matsui; Pietro Fontana; Setu Vora; Ying Zhang; Tian-Min Fu; Judy Lieberman; Hao Wu,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.302901""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.302901,2020-09-20,2020-09-20,,False
239,An immunodominance hierarchy exists in CD8+ T cell responses to HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes identified from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.,"COVID-19 vaccines are being rapidly developed and human trials are underway. Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, non-neutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-induced vaccines, novel vaccines on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered in the vaccine development. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-{gamma}-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three pattern types that varied sequentially, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.

240,Antisense oligonucleotides target a nearly invariant structural element from the SARS-CoV-2 genome and drive RNA degradation,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains an unusually large, single-stranded RNA genome that is punctuated with structured elements of unknown function, such as the s2m element located in the 3 untranslated region. The evolutionary conservation of the s2m element and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts implicates a key role in the viral infection cycle. In order to exploit this element as a potential therapeutic target, we have designed antisense ""gapmer"" oligonucleotides that efficiently base-pair to the s2m region. These oligonucleotides, composed of locked nucleic acids (LNA) flanking a central DNA core, successfully remodel the s2m structure and induce sequence-specific RNA cleavage by RNase H in vitro. Gapmers are also effective in human cells as they reduce the fluorescence signal in GFP reporter assays and cause a dose-dependent reduction in replication in a model replicon system based on a human astrovirus. Overall, these oligonucleotides show promise as anti-viral agents and may serve as a helpful starting point to develop treatments for COVID-19.",Wenhua Yu; Rongbin Xu; Tingting Ye; Chunlei Han; Shanshan Li; Yuming Guo; Carla A Houkamau; Taciano L Milfont; Danny Osborne; Nickola C Overall; John H Shaver; Geoffrey Troughton; Marc Wilson; Kumar Yogeeswaran,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.304139""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.304139,2020-09-19,2020-09-19,,False
241,Introduction of two prolines and removal of the polybasic cleavage site leads to optimal efficacy of a recombinant spike based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the mouse model,"The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the prime target for vaccine development. The spike protein mediates both binding to host cells and membrane fusion and is also so far the only known viral target of neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus spike proteins are large trimers that are relatively instable, a feature that might be enhanced by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Exchange of K986 and V987 to prolines has been shown to stabilize the trimers of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus spikes. Here, we test multiple versions of a soluble spike protein for their immunogenicity and protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model that transiently expresses human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 via adenovirus transduction. Variants tested include spike protein with a deleted polybasic cleavage site, the proline mutations, a combination thereof, as well as the wild type protein. While all versions of the protein were able to induce neutralizing antibodies, only the antigen with both a deleted cleavage site and the PP mutations completely protected from challenge in this mouse model.

ImportanceA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. A better understanding of antigen design and attributes that vaccine candidates need to have to induce protective immunity is of high importance.

We set up a population-based study to assess whether individuals with SMD had a higher risk of death associated with a COVID-19 infection (COVID-19 associated death) than individuals without SMD. Methods: Exploratory analysis with a cross-sectional design in the framework of a population-based register study covering the entire Swedish population. The Swedish Board for Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) provided anonymised tabulated summary data for further analysis. We compared numbers of COVID-19 associated death in individuals with SMD (cases) and without SMD (controls).

Results: The sample comprised of 7,923,859 individuals, 103,999 with SMD and 7,819,860 controls. There were 130 (0.1%) COVID-19 associated deaths in the SMD group and 4945 (0.06%) in the control group, corresponding to an OR of 1.98 (CI 1.66-2.35; p < 0.001). The odds were fourfold in the age group between 60 and 79 years. Cardiovascular diseases increased the odds by 50%.

Design Cost-effectiveness analysis. Participants We used societal data and COVID-19 mortality rates from the public domain. Interventions The intervention was a strict lockdown strategy that has been followed by Denmark. Reference strategy was flexible social distancing policy as was applied by Sweden. We derived mortality rates from COVID-19 national statistics, assumed the expected life years lost from each COVID-19 death to be 11 years and calculated lost life years until 31st August 2020. Expected economic costs were derived from gross domestic productivity (GDP) statistics from each country's official statistics bureau and forecasted GDP. The incremental financial costs of the strict lockdown were calculated by comparing Sweden with Denmark using externally available market information. Calculations were projected per one million inhabitants. In sensitivity analyses we varied the total cost of the lockdown (range -50% to +100%). Main outcome measure Financial costs per life years saved. Results In Sweden, the number of people who died with COVID-19 was 577 per million inhabitants, resulting in an estimated 6,350 life years lost per million inhabitants. In Denmark, where a strict lockdown strategy was installed for months, the number of people dying with COVID-19 was on average 111 per million, resulting in an estimated 1,216 life years per million inhabitants lost. The incremental costs of strict lockdown to save one life year was US$ 137,285, and higher in most of the sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Comparisons of public health interventions for COVID-19 should take into account life years saved and not only lost lives. Strict lockdown costs more than US$ 130,000 per life year saved.

Several national and state-level studies conducted predict the course of the pandemic using machine learning algorithms, most common being the SIR and the Logistic models. However, it is unclear whether these models work for a controlled community like Municipal Corporation or not. With measures now being employed at Municipal levels in India, it only fits to conduct particular research to examine how these models perform at lower jurisdictions. This study provides concrete evidence to show the superiority of the modified SIR model over the Logistic model based on analysis. The models not only give accurate predictions for up to 14 days but can also be used to define and signify the practicality and effectiveness of the decisions taken by the authorities. This feature of the study allows us to justly say that the government action of Unlock 1.0 was not a wise decision considering the nature of the pandemic.

To date, the disease has infected more than 18 million people with over 690k deaths reported. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard for clinical diagnosis but may produce false positives; thus, chest CT based diagnosis is considered more viable. However, accurate screening is challenging due to difficulty in annotation efforts of infected areas, curation of large datasets, and the slight discrepancies between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia. In this study, we propose an attention-based end-to-end weakly supervised framework for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia based on multiple instance learning (MIL). We further incorporate unsupervised contrastive learning for improved accuracy with attention applied both in spatial and latent contexts, herein we propose Dual Attention Contrastive based MIL (DA-CMIL). DA-CMIL takes as input a several patient CT slices (considered as a bag of instances) and outputs a single label. Attention based pooling is applied to implicitly select key slices in latent space, and spatial attention learns slice spatial context for interpretable diagnosis. A contrastive loss is applied at the instance level to encode similarity in features from the same patient against pooled patient features. Empirical results show our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 98.6% and an AUC of 98.4%.

247,Non-stationary Spatio-Temporal Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in The U.S.,"The fast transmission rate of COVID-19 worldwide has made this virus the most important challenge of year 2020. Many mitigation policies have been imposed by the governments at different regional levels (country, state, county, and city) to stop the spread of this virus. Quantifying the effect of such mitigation strategies on the transmission and recovery rates, and predicting the rate of new daily cases are two crucial tasks. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework which not only accounts for such policies but also utilizes the spatial and temporal information to characterize the pattern of COVID-19 progression. Specifically, a piecewise susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is developed while the dates at which the transmission/recover rates change significantly are defined as ""break points"" in this model. A novel and data-driven algorithm is designed to locate the break points using ideas from fused lasso and thresholding. In order to enhance the forecasting power and to describe additional temporal dependence among the daily number of cases, this model is further coupled with spatial smoothing covariates and vector auto-regressive (VAR) model. The proposed model is applied to several U.S. states and counties, and the results confirm the effect of ""stay-at-home orders"" and some states' early ""re-openings"" by detecting break points close to such events. Further, the model performed satisfactorily short-term forecasts of the number of new daily cases at regional levels by utilizing the estimated spatio-temporal covariance structures.

The idea was to understand the genetic loading variation, both temporal and distance-wise in the nearby wastewater drains when the number of infected COVID-19 patients is not varying much. Owing to the fact that isolation center, in general, always contained a constant number of 200 COVID-19 patients, the prime objective of the study was to check if several drains carrying RNA of coronavirus are actually getting diluted or accumulated along with the sewage network. Our finding suggested that while the temporal variation of the genetic load decreased in small drains over the span of 50 days, the main sewer exhibited accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Other interesting finding displays that probably distance of sampling location in meters is not likely to have a significant impact on gene detection concentration, although the quantity of the RNA extracted in the downstream of the drain was higher. These findings are of immense value from the perspective of wastewater surveillance of COVID-19, as they largely imply that we do not need to monitor every wastewater system, and probably major drains monitoring may illustrate the city health. Perhaps, we are reporting the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material along the sewer network i.e. from primary to tertiary drains. The study sought further data collection in this line to simulate conditions prevailed in the most of south Asian country and to shed further light on the temporal variation and decay/accumulation processes of the genetic load of the SARS-COV-2.",Wenhua Yu; Rongbin Xu; Tingting Ye; Chunlei Han; Shanshan Li; Yuming Guo; Carla A Houkamau; Taciano L Milfont; Danny Osborne; Nickola C Overall; John H Shaver; Geoffrey Troughton; Marc Wilson; Kumar Yogeeswaran; Chris G Sibley,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194696""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194696,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
249,Early Release Estimates for SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence and Antibody Response Interim Weighting for Probability-Based Sample Surveys,"Many months into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, basic epidemiologic parameters describing burden of disease are lacking. To reduce selection bias in current burden of disease estimates derived from diagnostic testing data or serologic testing in convenience samples, we are conducting a national probability-based sample SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey. Sampling from a national address-based frame and using mailed recruitment materials and test kits will allow us to estimate national prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibodies, overall and by demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics. Data will be weighted for unequal selection probabilities and non-response and will be adjusted to population benchmarks. Due to the urgent need for these estimates, expedited interim weighting of serosurvey responses will be undertaken to produce early release estimates, which will be published on the study website, COVIDVu.org.

251,Pentoxifylline and Covid-19: A Systematic Review,"At more than 10 months after the first case of COVID-19 was documented, the understanding of the pathogenesis of this viral illness is growing on a daily basis. A massive pro-inflammatory response on infected individuals involving several cytokines seems to play a key role on disease. As a result, therapeutic efforts have focused on anti-inflammatory strategies to ameliorate the disease, in sight of a lack of a truly effective anti-viral agent. Pentoxifylline (PTX) has been proposed by multiple authors as a potential therapeutic ally, targeting a variety of mechanisms as it has been shown to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory and hemodynamic effects. Importantly, anti-inflammatory effects center on down-regulation of cytokines such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor. In pre-pandemic studies, PTX has demonstrated to change the clinical course of inflammatory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Researchers agree it is pertinent to experimentally evaluate the effect this drug has on COVID-19 patients. The objective of this review is to summarize all the proposed mechanisms by which PTX may aid in the treatment of COVID-19, as well as prevent its deadly complications. Our interpretation of the literature is that the benefits PTX may bring to a patient with COVID-19 outweigh the risks this drug might pose on them. As a result, there is consensus regarding the evaluation of PTX in further experimental studies to better characterize its effects on COVID-19 patients.",Wenhua Yu; Rongbin Xu; Tingting Ye,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194381""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194381,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
252,Pre-existing T cell memory as a risk factor for severe 1 COVID-19 in the elderly,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) displays high clinical variability but the parameters that determine disease severity are still unclear. Pre-existing T cell memory has been hypothesized as a protective mechanism but conclusive evidence is lacking. Here we demonstrate that all unexposed individuals harbor SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells with marginal cross-reactivity to common cold corona and other unrelated viruses. They display low functional avidity and broad protein target specificities and their frequencies correlate with the overall size of the CD4+ memory compartment reflecting the immunological age of an individual. COVID-19 patients have strongly increased SARS-CoV-2-specific inflammatory T cell responses that are correlated with severity. Strikingly however, patients with severe COVID-19 displayed lower TCR functional avidity and less clonal expansion. Our data suggest that a low avidity pre-existing T cell memory negatively impacts on the T cell response quality against neoantigens such as SARS-CoV-2, which may predispose to develop inappropriate immune reactions especially in the elderly. We propose the immunological age as an independent risk factor to develop severe COVID-19.",Wenhua Yu; Rongbin Xu; Tingting Ye; Chunlei Han; Shanshan Li; Yuming Guo; Carla A Houkamau; Taciano L Milfont; Danny Osborne; Nickola C Overall; John H Shaver; Geoffrey Troughton; Marc Wilson; Kumar Yogeeswaran; Chris G Sibley; Itai M Pessach; Ran Barzilay; Johan Mattsson; Laila Sara Arroyo Mühr; Kalle Conneryd Lundgren; Matthias Kochanek; Frank Leypoldt; Oliver A Cornely; Philipp Koehler; Andre Franke; Alexander Scheffold,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20188896""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20188896,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
253,Efficacy of commercial mouth-rinses on SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva: Randomized Control Trial in Singapore,"The presence of high SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) titres in saliva may result in transmission of the virus and increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. This is particularly important as significant amounts of aerosols are generated during dental procedures, posing risk to dental care personnel and patients. Thus, reducing the titres of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of infected patients could be one of the key approaches to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during dental procedures. In this randomised control trial, the efficacy of three commercial mouth-rinse viz. povidone-iodine (PI), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), in reducing the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 positive patients were compared with water. A total of 36 COVID-19 positive patients were recruited, of which 16 patients were randomly assigned to four groups: PI group (n=4), CHX group (n=6), CPC group (n=4) and water as control group (n=2). Saliva samples were collected from all patients at baseline and at 5 min, 3 h and 6 h post-application of mouth-rinses/water. The samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR analysis. The fold change of Ct values were significantly increased in CPC group at 5 minutes and 6 h time points (p<0.05), while it showed significant increase at 6 h timepoint for PI group (p<0.01). Considering Ct values as an indirect method of arbitrarily quantifying the viral load, it can be postulated that CPC mouth-rinse can decrease the salivary SARS-CoV-2 levels within 5 minutes of use, compared to water rinsing. The effect of decreasing salivary load with CPC and PI mouth-rinsing was observed to be sustained at 6 h time point. Within the limitation of the current study, it can be concluded that use of CPC and PI formulated commercial mouth-rinses, with its sustained effect on reducing salivary SARS-CoV-2 level, may be useful as a pre-procedural rinse to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.",Wenhua Yu; Rongbin Xu; Tingting Ye; Chunlei Han; Shanshan Li; Yuming Guo; Carla A Houkamau; Taciano L Milfont; Danny Osborne; Nickola C Overall; John H Shaver; Geoffrey Troughton,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20186494""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20186494,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
254,"Acute, non-COVID related medical admissions during the first wave of COVID-19: A retrospective comparison of changing patterns of disease","Background: The COVID 19 pandemic was associated with social restrictions in the UK from 16th March 2020. It was unclear if the lockdown period was associated with differences in the case-mix of non-COVID acute medical admissions compared with the previous year. Methods: Retrospective data were collected for 1st to 30th April 2019 and 1st to 30th April 2020 from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest hospitals in the UK with over 2 million patient contacts per year. The latter time period was chosen to coincide with the peak of COVID-19 cases in the West Midlands. All patients admitted under acute medicine during these time periods were included. COVID-19 was confirmed by SARS-Cov-2 swab or a probable case of COVID-19 based on World Health Organization diagnostic parameters. Non-COVID patients were those with a negative SARS-Cov-2 swab and no suspicion of COVID-19. Data was sourced from the UHB in-house electronic health system (EHS). Results: The total number of acute medical admissions fell comparing April 2019 (n=2409) to April 2020 (n=1682). As a proportion of total admissions, those aged under 45 years decreased, while those aged 46 and over did not change. The number of admissions due to psychiatric conditions and overdoses was higher in April 2020 (p < 0.001). When viewed as a proportion of admissions, alcohol-related admissions (p = 0.004), psychiatric conditions and overdoses (p<0.001) increased in April 2020 than in April 2019. The proportion of patients who were in hospital due to falls also increased in April 2020 (p<0.001). In the same period, the absolute number and the proportion of admissions that were due to non-specific chest pain, to musculoskeletal complaints and patients who self-discharged prior to assessment decreased (p=0.02, p=0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively). There were no significant differences in non-COVID-related intensive care admissions or mortality between the same months in the two years. Conclusion: In this large, single-centre study, there was a change in hospitalised case-mix when comparing April 2019 with April 2020: an increase in conditions which potentially reflect social isolation (falls, drug and alcohol misuse and psychiatric illness) and a decrease in conditions which rarely require in-patient hospital treatment (musculoskeletal pain and non-cardiac chest pain) especially among younger adults.

255,Disease control as an optimization problem,"Traditionally, expert epidemiologists devise policies for disease control through a mixture of intuition and brute force. Namely, they use their know-how to narrow down the set of logically conceivable policies to a small family described by a few parameters, following which they conduct a grid search to identify the optimal policy within the set. This scheme is not scalable, in the sense that, when used to optimize over policies which depend on many parameters, it would likely fail to output an optimal disease policy in time for its implementation. In this article, we use techniques from convex optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease policies described by hundreds of parameters. We illustrate our approach by minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al. (March, 2020). We observe that optimal policies are typically very complex, and thus unlikely to be discovered by a human agent.",Wenhua Yu; Rongbin Xu; Tingting Ye,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194811""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194811,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

In this study, we analysed the content, type and quality of Q&As in Quora regarding this pandemic, and compared the information with that on World Health Organization (WHO) website. Methods We conducted a systematic search to include 964 questions in Quora. The tone of the question was categorized as either positive (questions with a primary intent to obtain information), negative (questions which represent panic or are related to misconception/false information) or ambivalent. The two most helpful answers of each question were graded for accuracy, authority, popularity, readability, and relevancy. Results 462 (48%) questions were classified as positive, while 391 (41%) were negative. Number of views were higher for negative questions (11421 vs 7300, p=0.004). Majority of the questions were on social impact (N=217, 23%), followed by politics (N=122, 13%) and disease management (N=96, 10%). Positive questions had more accurate, but less popular answers (p<0.05). Information related to 229 (28%) questions were present on WHO website, while partial information was present for 103 (11%) questions.

258,Distribution equality as an optimal epidemic mitigation strategy,"Upon the development of a drug or vaccine, a successful response to a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, requires the capacity for efficient distribution at a global scale. Considering constraints on production and shipping, most existing strategies seek to maximize the outflow of therapeutics, hence optimizing for rapid dissemination. Surprisingly, we find that this intuitive approach is counterproductive. The reason is that focusing strictly on the quantity of disseminated therapeutics, such strategies disregard their specific spreading patterns, most crucially, they overlook the interplay of these spreading patterns with those of the pathogens. This results in a discrepancy between supply and demand, that prohibits efficient mitigation even under optimal conditions of superfluous drug/vaccine flow. Therefore, here, we design a dissemination strategy that naturally follows the predicted spreading patterns of the epidemic, optimizing not just for supply volume, but also for its congruency with the anticipated demand. Specifically, we show that epidemics spread relatively uniformly across all destinations, and hence we introduce an equality constraint into our dissemination that prioritizes supply homogeneity. This strategy may, at times, slow down the supply rate in certain locations, however, thanks to its egalitarian nature, which mimics the flow of the viral spread, it provides a dramatic leap in overall mitigation efficiency, saving more lives with orders of magnitude less resources.",Wenhua Yu; Rongbin Xu; Tingting Ye; Chunlei Han; Shanshan Li,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194506""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194506,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
259,Longitudinal analysis of the utility of liver biochemistry in hospitalised COVID-19 patients as prognostic markers,"Background: COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has been associated with deranged liver biochemistry in studies from China, Italy and the USA. However, the clinical utility of liver biochemistry as a prognostic marker of outcome for COVID-19 is currently debated. Methods: We extracted routinely collected clinical data from a large teaching hospital in the UK, matching 585 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients to 1165 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative patients for age, gender, ethnicity and pre-existing comorbidities. Liver biochemistry was compared between groups over time to determine whether derangement was associated with outcome. Results: 26.8% (157/585) of COVID-19 patients died, compared to 11.9% (139/1165) in the non-COVID-19 group (p<0.001). At presentation, a significantly higher proportion of the COVID-19 group had elevated alanine aminotransferase (20.7% vs. 14.6%, p=0.004) and hypoalbuminaemia (58.7% vs. 35.0%, p<0.001), compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Within the COVID-19 group, those with hypoalbuminaemia at presentation had 1.83-fold increased hazards of death compared to those with normal albumin (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67), whilst the hazard of death was ~4-fold higher in those aged [&ge;]75 years (adjusted HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.59-6.04) and ~3-fold higher in those with pre-existing liver disease (adjusted HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.58-7.16). In the COVID-19 group, alkaline phosphatase increased (R=0.192, p<0.0001) and albumin declined (R=-0.123, p=0.0004) over time in patients who died. We did not find a significant association between other liver biochemistry and death.

260,COVID-19 epidemic severity is associated with timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions,"Background: Unprecedented public health interventions including travel restrictions and national lockdowns have been implemented to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, but the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still debated. International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.",Wenhua Yu; Rongbin Xu; Tingting Ye; Chunlei Han; Shanshan Li; Yuming Guo; Carla A Houkamau; Taciano L Milfont; Danny Osborne; Nickola C Overall; John H Shaver; Geoffrey Troughton; Marc Wilson; Kumar Yogeeswaran; Chris G Sibley; Itai M Pessach,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194258""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194258,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

We model R as a flexible, hidden Markov state process and exactly solve forward-backward algorithms, to derive R estimates that incorporate all available incidence information. This unifies and extends two popular methods, EpiEstim, which considers past incidence, and the Wallinga-Teunis method, which looks forward in time. This combination of maximising information and minimising assumptions, makes EpiFilter more statistically robust in periods of low incidence, where existing methods can struggle. As a result, we find EpiFilter to be particularly suited for assessing the risk of second waves of infection, in real time.",Wenhua Yu,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194589""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194589,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

264,A SARS-CoV-2 Reference Standard Quantified by Multi-digital PCR Platforms for Quality Assessment of Molecular Tests,"SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans and has caused an emerging and rapidly evolving global pandemic (COVID-19) with significant morbidity and mortality. To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been urgently authorized by regulators worldwide. The limit of detection (LoD) is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, and a reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for LoD studies. Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA carrying specific genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure including nucleic acid extraction and to accommodate customized primer-probe sets targeting different genome sequences. Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the NAT-detectable units as viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple commercialized platforms. The median of the quantification results (460000 {+/-}65000 GEQ/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference standard. This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially approved diagnostic assays.

Here we investigated the associations between COVID-19 pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course. Methods. Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; N = 4 171) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; N = 1 559). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. Findings. In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US). Interpretation. Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and the exacerbation of symptoms over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety. Considering the painful dilemma of lockdown versus reopening, with the tradeoff between public health and economic wellbeing, our findings provide evidence that the economic impact of COVID-19 has negative implications for mental health.

267,"Knowledge, attitudes and practices associated with the COVID-19 among slum dwellers resided in Dhaka City: A Bangladeshi interview-based survey","Background: The emergent COVID-19 has impacted unprecedentedly to all classes of people. Slum-dwellers' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 are currently poorly understood. To investigate the KAP towards COVID-19 among slum dwellers resided in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional offline survey was carried out enrolling 406 slum dwellers (53.2% male; mean age=44.9 years [SD=12.1]; age range=18-85 years) between August and September, 2020. The face to face interview was conducted to collect data from 6 selected slum areas in Dhaka City using convenience sampling. The questionnaire consisted of informed consent along with questions concerning observational checklists, socio-demographics, and KAP. Results: A sizeable minority were observed without wearing face masks during the survey periods (18.2%) and a vast portion (97.5%) without any hand protection. The mean scores of KAP were 6.1plus-or-minus sign2.6 (out of 17), 12.3plus-or-minus sign1.7 (out of 14), and 9.8plus-or-minus sign1.6 (out of 12), respectively. Moreover, the KAP were strongly and positively correlated with each other. Conclusions: The findings revealed that the majority of slum dwellers in Bangladesh have limited knowledge of COVID-19. Poor practices (i.e., face mask and hand protection) were directly observed during the survey.

268,Longitudinal Mediators of Early Pandemic Distress,"We leverage powerful time-series data from a national longitudinal sample measured before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the world's eighth most stringent COVID-19 lockdown (New Zealand, March-April 2020, N = 940) and apply Bayesian multilevel mediation models to rigorously test five theories of pandemic distress. Findings: (1) during lockdown, rest diminished distress; without rest psychological distress would have been about 1.74 times greater; (2) an elevated sense of community reduced distress, a little, but elevated government satisfaction was inert. Thus, the psychological benefits of lockdown extended to political discontents; (3) most lockdown distress arose from dissatisfaction from personal relationships. Social captivity, more than isolation, proved challenging; (4-5) Health and business satisfaction were stable; were they challenged substantially more distress would have ensued. Thus, lockdown benefited psychological health by affording safety, yet only because income remained secure.

269,COVID-19 pandemic increased the magnitude of mortality risks associated with cold temperature in Italy: A nationwide time-stratified case-crossover study,"Abstract Backgrounds: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and some containment measures have changed many people lives and behaviours. Whether the pandemic could change the association between cold temperature and mortality remains unknown. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality in the pandemic period has changed compared to non-COVID-19 period (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily all-cause mortality data and meteorological data for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-crossover design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality during the first three months (from March to May in 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak and the same months in 2015-2019. Results: The relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality at extreme cold temperature (2.5th percentile of temperature at 3 {degrees}C) in comparison with the minimum mortality temperature (24 {degrees}C) was 4.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.90-5.79] in the pandemic period, which is more than triple higher than RR [1.41 (95%CI: 1.33-1.50)] in the same months during 2015-2019. The shift in cold-mortality association was particularly significant for people aged 65-74 years [RR (95%CI): 5.98 (3.78-9.46) in 2020 versus 1.29 (1.10-1.51) in 2015-2019], 75-84 years [5.25 (3.79-7.26) versus 1.40 (1.25-1.56)], and [&ge;] 85 years [5.03 (3.90-6.51) versus 1.52 (1.39-1.66)], but not significant for those aged 0-64 years [1.95 (1.17-3.24) versus 1.24 (1.05-1.48)]. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the risk of cold temperature on mortality in Italy, particularly among the elderly people.

270,"Adherence to the test, trace and isolate system: results from a time series of 21 nationally representative surveys in the UK (the COVID-19 Rapid Survey of Adherence to Interventions and Responses  study)","Objectives: To investigate rates of adherence to the UKs test, trace and isolate system over time. Design: Time series of cross-sectional online surveys. Setting: Data were collected between 2 March and 5 August 2020. Participants: 42,127 responses from 31,787 people living in the UK, aged 16 years or over, are presented (21 survey waves, n{approx}2,000 per wave). Main outcome measures: Identification of the key symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, high temperature / fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste), self-reported adherence to self-isolation if symptomatic, requesting an antigen test if symptomatic, intention to share details of close contacts, self-reported adherence to quarantine if alerted that you had been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Results: Only 48.9% of participants (95% CI 48.2% to 49.7%) identified key symptoms of COVID-19. Self-reported adherence to test, trace and isolate behaviours was low (self-isolation 18.2%, 95% CI 16.4% to 19.9%; requesting an antigen test 11.9%, 95% CI 10.1% to 13.8%; intention to share details of close contacts 76.1%, 95% CI 75.4% to 76.8%; quarantining 10.9%, 95% CI 7.8% to 13.9%) and largely stable over time. By contrast, intention to adhere to protective measures was much higher. Non-adherence was associated with: men, younger age groups, having a dependent child in the household, lower socio-economic grade, greater hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector.

271,Demand for Self-Managed Online Telemedicine Abortion in Eight European Countries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Regression Discontinuity Analysis,"Objectives: In most European countries, patients seeking medication abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic are still expected to attend healthcare settings in person despite lockdown measures and infection risk. We assessed whether demand for self-managed medication abortion provided by a fully remote online telemedicine service increased following the emergence of COVID-19. Design: We used regression discontinuity to compare the number of requests to online telemedicine service Women on Web in eight European countries before and after they implemented lockdown measures to slow COVID-19 transmission. We examined the number deaths due to COVID-19, the degree of government-provided economic support, the severity of lockdown travel restrictions, and the medication abortion service provision model in countries with and without significant changes in requests. Setting: Eight European countries served by Women on Web. Participants: 3,915 people who made requests for self-managed abortion to Women on Web between January 1st, 2019 and June 1st, 2020. Main Outcome Measures: Percent change in requests to Women on Web before and after the emergence of COVID-19 and associated lockdown measures. Results: Five countries showed significant increases in requests, ranging from 28% in Northern Ireland (p=0.001) to 139% in Portugal (p<0.001). Two countries showed no significant change in requests, and one country, Great Britain, showed an 88% decrease in requests (p<0.001). Countries with significant increases in requests were either countries where abortion services are mainly provided in hospitals or where no abortion services are available and international travel was prohibited during lockdown. By contrast, Great Britain authorized teleconsultation for medication abortion and provision of medications by mail during the pandemic. Conclusion: These marked changes in requests for self-managed medication abortion during COVID-19 demonstrate demand for fully remote models of abortion care and an urgent need for policymakers to expand access to medication abortion by telemedicine.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu; Joshua A Weiner,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195222""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195222,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
272,Clinical evolution of COVID-19 during pregnancy at different altitudes: a population-based study,"Background: The impact of influenza and various types of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) on pregnancy has been reported. However, the current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to reveal important data for understanding its behavior in pregnant women. Methods: We analyzed the records of 326,586 non-pregnant women of reproductive age and 7,444 pregnant women with no other risk factor who also had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result to estimate adjusted prevalence (aP) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of COVID-19 and its requirement of hospitalization, intubation, ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Adjustment was done through Poisson regressions for age and altitude of residence and birth. Generalized binomial models were used to generate probability plots to display how each outcome varied across ages and altitudes. Results: Pregnancy was independently associated with a 15% higher probability of COVID-19 (aPR: 1.15), a 116% higher probability of its following admission (aPR: 2.169) and a 127% higher probability of ICU admission (aPR: 2.275). Also, pregnancy was associated with 84.2% higher probability of developing pneumonia (aPR: 1.842) and a 163% higher probability of its following admission (aPR: 2.639). There were no significant differences in COVID-19 case-fatality rates between pregnant and non pregnant women (1.178, 95% CI: 0.68-1.67). Conclusion: Pregnancy was associated with a higher probability of COVID-19, developing of pneumonia, hospitalization, and ICU admission. Our results also suggest that the risk of COVID-19 and its related outcomes, except for intubation, decrease with altitude.

273,An ELISA protocol with resolution at high sample concentration reveals reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted work, economy, and way of life. The SARS-CoV-2 virus displays unique features including widely varying symptoms and outcomes between infected individuals. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into virus transmission dynamics, pre-existing cross-reactive immunity, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. This BU ELISA method exhibits very low signal from plasma or serum samples added to uncoated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) reactive antibodies from blood samples drawn prior to May 2019. Of our pre-pandemic cohort, no SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive IgG antibodies were detected in subjects over 70 years of age, and SARS-CoV-2 NP-reactive antibodies were present at similar levels to infected subjects in some individuals and very low in others. Also, samples drawn in May 2020 from two individuals with no symptoms or no known virus exposure contained SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive antibodies at intermediate amounts compared with other subject groups (higher than pre-pandemic and lower than confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected). The one asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 convalescent subject in our study possessed comparable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific IgM and IgG but drastically lower IgA than the symptomatic counterparts. Also, our assay detected positive signal from samples that gave negative results in a commercially available Lateral Flow Device (LFD) and the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu; Joshua A Weiner; Evan M Bloch; Kirsten Littlefield; Wendy Wieland-Alter; Ruth I Connor; Peter F Wright; Sarah E Benner; Tania S Bonny; Oliver Laeyendecker; David J Sullivan; Shmuel Shoham; Thomas Quinn; H Benjamin Larman; Arturo Casadevall; Andrew Pekosz; Andrew Redd; Aaron AR Tobian,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20192765""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20192765,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
274,"Longitudinal multi-omics analysis identifies responses of megakaryocytes, erythroid cells and plasmablasts as hallmarks of severe COVID-19 trajectories","The pandemic spread of the potentially life-threatening disease COVID-19 requires a thorough understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of host responses. Temporal resolution of cellular features associated with a severe disease trajectory will be a pre-requisite for finding disease outcome predictors. Here, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics study using a two-centre German cohort of 13 patients (from Cologne and Kiel, cohort 1). We analysed the bulk transcriptome, bulk DNA methylome, and single-cell transcriptome (>358,000 cells, including BCR profiles) of peripheral blood samples harvested from up to 5 time points. The results from single-cell and bulk transcriptome analyses were validated in two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients from Bonn (18 patients, cohort 2) and Nijmegen (40 patients, cohort 3), respectively. We observed an increase of proliferating, activated plasmablasts in severe COVID-19, and show a distinct expression pattern related to a hyperactive cellular metabolism of these cells. We further identified a notable expansion of type I IFN-activated circulating megakaryocytes and their progenitors, indicative of emergency megakaryopoiesis, which was confirmed in cohort 2. These changes were accompanied by increased erythropoiesis in the critical phase of the disease with features of hypoxic signalling. Finally, projecting megakaryocyte- and erythroid cell-derived co-expression modules to longitudinal blood transcriptome samples from cohort 3 confirmed an association of early temporal changes of these features with fatal COVID-19 disease outcome. In sum, our longitudinal multi-omics study demonstrates distinct cellular and gene expression dynamics upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, which point to metabolic shifts of circulating immune cells, and reveals changes in megakaryocytes and increased erythropoiesis as important outcome indicators in severe COVID-19 patients.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu; Joshua A Weiner; Evan M Bloch; Kirsten Littlefield; Wendy Wieland-Alter; Ruth I Connor; Peter F Wright; Sarah E Benner; Tania S Bonny; Oliver Laeyendecker; David J Sullivan; Shmuel Shoham; Thomas Quinn; H Benjamin Larman; Arturo Casadevall; Andrew Pekosz; Andrew Redd; Aaron AR Tobian; Margaret E Ackerman; Lisa M Schilling; Vignesh Subbian; David Vizcaya; Andrew Williams; Lin Zhang; Ying Zhang; Hong Zhu; Li Liu; Peter Rijnbeek; George Hripcsak; Jennifer C.E Lane; Edward Burn; Christian Reich; Marc A Suchard; Talita Duarte-Salles; Kristin Kostka; Patrick B Ryan; DANIEL PRIETO-ALHAMBRA; Georg Laue; Clemes Lier; Matthias Lindner; Georgios Marinos; Robert Markewitz; Jacob Nattermann; Rainer Noth; Peter Pickkers; Klaus F.

275,Clinical Thrombosis Rate was not Increased in a Cohort of Cancer Patients with COVID-19,"Increased rates of thromboembolic events (TE) have been reported in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), even without prior predisposition to thrombosis. D-dimer levels have been shown to positively correlate with disease severity and mortality, leading to adoption of new empiric anticoagulation protocols by many centers. We aimed to assess whether COVID-19 further increased the risk of TE events in a cancer population who tested positive for COVID-19 at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. The electronic medical records of 218 cancer patients were retrospectively reviewed up to April 10th, 2020. Work-up of thrombosis was done by the primary team upon clinical or laboratory suspicion. All imaging studies' reports, within 20 days of COVID-19 positive test, were reviewed for presence of new arterial or venous thrombosis. Mortality was assessed up to one month since positive COVID-19 test result. Twelve patients (5.5%) were found to have new arterial (N=6, 50%) or venous (N=6, 50%) thrombosis. Five patients (41.7%) had history of prior TE events. Incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Arterial events occurred in the brain (66.7%), aorta (16.7%) and coronary arteries (16.7%). Median time from COVID test was 8 days (IQR, 1.5 - 11.3). Five patients (41.7%) had received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation for a median 2 days (IQR, 1 - 5). Median peak D-dimer within 36 hours of the TE event was 9.8 mcg/mL (N=4 patients, IQR, 1.7 - 18.3). Mortality did not differ significantly between the patients with new TE events vs those without; mortality 41.7% vs 37.4%, respectively, p=0.77. Empiric anticoagulation did not improve mortality.

276,COVID-19 Case-Age Distribution: Correction for Differential Testing by Age,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen and is currently the cause of a global pandemic. Despite expected universal susceptibility to a novel pathogen, the pandemic to date has been characterized by higher observed incidence in the oldest individuals and lower incidence in children and adolescents. Differential testing by age group may explain some of these observed differences, but datasets linking case counts to public health testing volumes are uncommon. Methods: We used data from Ontario, Canada. Case data were obtained from Ontarios provincial line, while testing data were obtained from an information system with complete SARS-CoV-2 testing data for public, hospital, and private laboratories. Demographic and temporal patterns in reported case incidence, testing rates, and test positivity were explored using negative binomial regression models. Standardized morbidity and testing ratios (SMR, STR), and standardized test positivity (STP) were calculated by dividing age- and sex-specific rates by overall rates; demographic and temporal patterns in standardized ratios were explored using meta-regression. Testing adjusted SMR were estimated using linear regression models. Results: Observed disease incidence and testing rates were highest in oldest individuals and markedly lower in those aged < 20. Temporal trends in disease incidence and testing were observed, but standardizing morbidity and testing ratios eliminated temporal trends (i.e., relative patterns by age and sex remained identical regardless of epidemic phase). After adjustment for testing frequency, SMR were lowest in children and adults aged 70 and older, approximately the same in adolescents as in the population as a whole and elevated in young adults (aged 20-29 years), providing a markedly different picture of the epidemic than seen with crude SMR or case-based incidence. Test-adjusted SMR were validated using seroprevalence data (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.82, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically performed using only test-positive case data, without adjustment for testing frequency. Older adults are tested more frequently, likely due to increased disease severity, while children are under-tested. Adjustment for testing frequency results in a very different picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by age, one that is consistent with estimates obtained through serological testing.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu; Joshua A Weiner; Evan M Bloch,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20193862""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20193862,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

Meanwhile, evidence is mounting that the pandemic is characterized by superspreading, where a small fraction account for the majority of infections. Capturing this phenomenon theoretically requires modeling at the scale of individuals.

278,Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza and the impact of coinfection on disease severity: A test negative design,"Background: The potential impact of COVID-19 alongside influenza on morbidity, mortality and health service capacity is a major concern as the Northern Hemisphere winter approaches. This study investigates the interaction between influenza and COVID-19 during the latter part of the 2019-20 influenza season in England. Methods: Individuals tested for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 were extracted from national surveillance systems between 20/01/2020 and 25/04/2020. To estimate influenza infection on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, univariable and multivariable analyses on the odds of SARS-CoV-2 in those who tested positive for influenza compared to those who tested negative for influenza. To assess whether a coinfection was associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 outcome, univariable and multivariable analyses on the odds of death adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity and coinfection status. Findings: The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 68% lower among influenza positive cases, suggesting possible pathogenic competition between the two viruses. Patients with a coinfection had a risk of death of 5.92 (95% CI, 3.21-10.91) times greater than among those with neither influenza nor SARS-CoV-2 suggesting possible synergistic effects in coinfected individuals. The odds of ventilator use or death and ICU admission or death was greatest among coinfection patients showing strong evidence of an interaction effect compared to SARS-CoV-2/influenza acting independently. Interpretation: Cocirculation of these viruses could have a significant impact on morbidity, mortality and health service demand.

Using epidemiological models calibrated to the current pandemic, we simulate the time course of each clinical trial design for 504 unique combinations of parameters, allowing us to determine which trial design is most effective for a given scenario. A human challenge trial provides maximal net benefits---averting an additional 1.1M infections and 8,000 deaths in the U.S. compared to the next best clinical trial design---if its set-up time is short or the pandemic spreads slowly.

280,"Proteomics identifies a type I IFN, prothrombotic hyperinflammatory circulating COVID-19 neutrophil signature distinct from non-COVID-19 ARDS","Understanding the mechanisms by which infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is of significant clinical interest given the mortality associated with severe and critical coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neutrophils play a key role in the lung injury characteristic of non-COVID-19 ARDS, but a relative paucity of these cells is observed at post-mortem in lung tissue of patients who succumb to infection with SARS-CoV-2. With emerging evidence of a dysregulated innate immune response in COVID-19, we undertook a functional proteomic survey of circulating neutrophil populations, comparing patients with COVID-19 ARDS, non-COVID-19 ARDS, moderate COVID-19, and healthy controls. We observe that expansion of the circulating neutrophil compartment and the presence of activated low and normal density mature and immature neutrophil populations occurs in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS. In contrast, release of neutrophil granule proteins, neutrophil activation of the clotting cascade and formation of neutrophil platelet aggregates is significantly increased in COVID-19 ARDS. Importantly, activation of components of the neutrophil type I IFN responses is specific to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and linked to metabolic rewiring. Together this work highlights how differential activation of circulating neutrophil populations may contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS, identifying processes that are specific to COVID-19 ARDS.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu; Joshua A Weiner; Evan M Bloch; Kirsten Littlefield; Wendy Wieland-Alter; Ruth I Connor; Peter F Wright; Sarah E Benner; Tania S Bonny; Oliver Laeyendecker; David J Sullivan; Shmuel Shoham; Thomas Quinn; H Benjamin Larman; Arturo Casadevall; Andrew Pekosz; Andrew Redd; Aaron AR Tobian; Margaret E Ackerman; Lisa M Schilling; Vignesh Subbian; David Vizcaya; Andrew Williams; Lin Zhang; Ying Zhang; Hong Zhu; Li Liu; Peter Rijnbeek; George Hripcsak; Jennifer C.E Lane,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195305""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195305,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

We characterized the utilization of medicines as prescribed in routine practice amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Korea, China, Spain, and the USA. Design: International network cohort Setting: Hospital electronic health records from Columbia University Irving Medical Centre (NYC, USA), Stanford (CA, USA), Tufts (MA, USA), Premier (USA), Optum EHR (USA), department of veterans affairs (USA), NFHCRD (Honghu, China) and HM Hospitals (Spain); and nationwide claims from HIRA (South Korea) Participants: patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from January to June 2020 Main outcome measures: Prescription/dispensation of any medicine on or 30 days after hospital admission date Analyses: Number and percentage of users overall and over time Results: 71,921 people were included: 304 from China, 2,089 from Spain, 7,599 from South Korea, and 61,929 from the USA. A total of 3,455 medicines were identified. Common repurposed medicines included hydroxychloroquine (<2% in NFHCRD to 85.4% in HM), azithromycin (4.9% in NFHCRD to 56.5% in HM), lopinavir/ritonavir (<3% in all US but 34.9% in HIRA and 56.5% in HM), and umifenovir (0% in all except 78.3% in NFHCRD). Adjunctive medicines were used with great variability, with the ten most used treatments being (in descending order): bemiparin, enoxaparin, heparin, ceftriaxone, aspirin, vitamin D, famotidine, vitamin C, dexamethasone, and metformin. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increased rapidly in use in March-April but declined steeply in May-June. Conclusions: Multiple medicines were used in the first months of COVID-19 pandemic, with substantial geographic and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most prescribed repurposed medicines. Antithrombotics, antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids were often used as adjunctive treatments.

283,Modeling the Spread and Control of COVID-19,"Data-centric models of COVID-19 have been tried, but have certain limitations. In this work, we propose an agent-based model of the epidemic in a confined space of agents representing humans. An extension to the SEIR model allows us to consider the difference between the appearance (black-box view) of the spread of disease, and the real situation (glass-box view). Our model allows for simulations of lockdowns, social distancing, personal hygiene, quarantine, and hospitalization, with further considerations of different parameters such as the extent to which hygiene and social distancing are observed in a population. Our results give qualitative indications of the effects of various policies and parameters; for instance, that lockdowns by themselves are extremely unlikely to bring an end to an epidemic and may indeed make things worse, that social distancing matters more than personal hygiene, and that the growth of infection comes down significantly for moderately high levels of social distancing and hygiene, even in the absence of herd immunity.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20195826""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20195826,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
284,Parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future Covid-19 vaccine: a multi-methods study in England,"Background: The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine has been heralded as key to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. Methods: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents were interviewed. Findings: Most participants reported they would definitely accept or were unsure but leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their child/children. Participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than for their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Respondents from lower income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. The main reason for vaccine acceptance was for self-protection from COVID-19. Common concerns were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, which were largely prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. Conclusion: To alleviate concerns, information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu; Joshua A Weiner,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20188227""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20188227,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
285,The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on healthcare provision in Italy to non-COVID patients: a systematic review,"Background: Italy has been one of the countries most affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the regional healthcare system has had to quickly adapt its organization to meet the needs of infected patients. This has led to a drastic change in the routine management of non-communicable diseases with a potential long-term impact on patient health care. We investigated the management of non-COVID-19 patients across all medical specialties during the pandemic in Italy. Methods: A PRISMA guideline-based systematic review of the available literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, restricting the search to the main outbreak period in Italy (from 20 February to 22 June, 2020). We selected articles in English or Italian that detailed changes in the Italian hospital care for non-COVID-19 patients due to the pandemic. Our keywords included all medical specialties in combination with our geographical focus (Italy) and COVID-19. Findings: Of the 4643 potentially eligible studies identified by the search, 247 studies were included in the systematic review. A decrease in the management of emergencies in non-COVID patients was found together with an increase in mortality. Similarly, non-deferrable conditions met a tendency toward decreased diagnosis. All specialties have been affected by the reorganization of healthcare provision in the hub-and-spoke system and have benefited from telemedicine during the pandemic. Interpretation: Our work highlights the changes taking place in the Italian public healthcare system in order to tackle the developing health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

286,Social distancing: barriers to its implementation and how they can be overcome - a rapid systematic review and synthesis of qualitative studies,"Aim: To systematically review qualitative literature on social distancing in order to identify and describe factors that enable or prevent its implementation. Methods: A rapid systematic qualitative review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA and ENTREQ guidelines. A comprehensive systematic search was carried out in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Global Health, CINAHL and Web of Science. Included papers (i) report on primary qualitative studies (ii) of the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of social distancing measures (iii) in potentially epidemic infectious diseases. After critical appraisal and standardised data extraction, a meta-ethnographical approach was used for synthesis. Review findings were assessed for strength and reliability using CerQUAL. Results: 28 papers were included from the systematic search that yielded 5620 results. One additional paper was found by searching references. The review identifies two broad categories of barriers to social distancing measures: individual- or community-level psychological or sociological phenomena, and perceived shortcomings in governmental action. Based on this, 25 themes are identified that can be addressed to improve the implementation of social distancing. Conclusion: There are many barriers, on different levels, to the implementation of social distancing measures. Among other findings, the review identifies the need for good communication as well as the need for authorities to provide comprehensive support as two key opportunities to increase acceptability and adherence. High-quality research is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic to better describe mechanisms by which implementation of social distancing can be improved, and, more importantly, what is already known has to be put into practice.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20195966""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20195966,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

Objective: To determine important drivers of decisions to obtain a SARS-CoV-2 test in the context of increasing community transmission. Design: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to assess the relative importance of type of SARS-CoV-2 test, specimen type, testing venue, and results turnaround time. Uptake of an optimized testing scenario was simulated relative to the current typical testing scenario of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) via nasopharyngeal (NP) swab in a provider office or urgent care clinic with results in >5 days. Setting: Online survey, embedded in an existing cohort study, conducted during July 30 - September 8, 2020. Participants: Participants (n=4,793) were enrolled in the CHASING COVID Cohort Study, a national longitudinal cohort of adults >18 years residing in the 50 US states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, or Guam. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Relative importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing method attributes, utilities of specific attribute levels, and probability of choosing a testing scenario based on preferences estimated from the DCE, the current typical testing option, or choosing not to test. Results: Turnaround time for test results had the highest relative importance (30.4%), followed by test type (28.3%), specimen type (26.2%), and venue (15.0%). Participants preferred fast results on both past and current infection and using a noninvasive specimen, preferably collected at home. Simulations suggested that providing immediate or same day test results, providing both PCR and serology, or collecting oral specimens would substantially increase testing uptake over the current typical testing option. Simulated uptake of a hypothetical testing scenario of PCR and serology via a saliva sample at a pharmacy with same day results was 97.7%, compared to 0.6% for the current typical testing scenario, with 1.8% opting for no test.

Materials and Methods: A published convolutional Siamese neural network-based model previously trained on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was tuned using 250 outpatient CXRs. This model produces a quantitative measure of COVID-19 lung disease severity (pulmonary x-ray severity (PXS) score). The model was evaluated on CXRs from four test sets, including 3 from the United States (patients hospitalized at an academic medical center (N=154), patients hospitalized at a community hospital (N=113), and outpatients (N=108)) and 1 from Brazil (patients at an academic medical center emergency department (N=303)). Radiologists from both countries independently assigned reference standard CXR severity scores, which were correlated with the PXS scores as a measure of model performance (Pearson r). The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique was used to visualize the neural network results. Results: Tuning the deep learning model with outpatient data improved model performance in two United States hospitalized patient datasets (r=0.88 and r=0.90, compared to baseline r=0.86). Model performance was similar, though slightly lower, when tested on the United States outpatient and Brazil emergency department datasets (r=0.86 and r=0.85, respectively). UMAP showed that the model learned disease severity information that generalized across test sets. Conclusions: Performance of a deep learning-based model that extracts a COVID-19 severity score on CXRs improved using training data from a different patient cohort (outpatient versus hospitalized) and generalized across multiple populations.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu; Joshua A Weiner; Evan M Bloch; Kirsten Littlefield; Wendy Wieland-Alter; Ruth I Connor; Peter F Wright; Sarah E Benner; Tania S Bonny; Oliver Laeyendecker; David J Sullivan; Shmuel Shoham; Thomas Quinn,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195453""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195453,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
290,Graphene nanoplatelet and Graphene oxide functionalization of face mask materials inhibits infectivity of trapped SARS-CoV-2,"Recent advancements in bidimensional nanoparticles such as Graphene nanoplatelets (G) and the derivative Graphene oxide (GO) have the potential to meet the need for highly functional personal protective equipment (PPE) that confers increased protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the spread COVID-19. The ability of G and GO to interact with and bind microorganisms as well as RNA and DNA provides an opportunity to develop engineered textiles for use in PPE. The face masks widely used in health care and other high-risk settings for COVID transmission provide only a physical barrier that decreases likelihood of infection and do not inactivate the virus. Here, we show pre-incubation of viral particles with free GO inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO cells. Highly relevant to PPE materials, when either polyurethane or cotton material was loaded with G or GO and culture medium containing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles either filtered through or incubated with the functionalized materials, the infectivity of the medium was nearly completely inhibited.

291,Integrative Genomics Analysis Reveals a Novel 21q22.11 Locus Contributing to Susceptibility of COVID-19,"The systematic identification of host genetic risk factors is essential for the understanding and treatment of COVID-19. By performing a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association (GWAS) summary datasets (N = 680,128), a novel locus at 21q22.11 was identified to be associated with COVID-19 infection (rs9976829 in IFNAR2 and upstream of IL10RB, OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09 - 1.23, P = 2.57*10-6). The rs9976829 represents a strong splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) for both IFNAR2 and IL10RB genes, especially in lung tissue (P = 1.8*10-24). Gene-based association analysis also found IFNAR2 was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection (P = 2.58*10-7). Integrative genomics analysis of combining GWAS with eQTL data showed the expression variations of IFNAR2 and IL10RB have prominent effects on COVID-19 in various types of tissues, especially in lung tissue. The majority of IFNAR2-expressing cells were dendritic cells (40%) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (38.5%), and IL10RB-expressing cells were mainly nonclassical monocytes (29.6%). IFNAR2 and IL10RB are targeted by several interferons-related drugs.

292,"The ""Great Lockdown"": Inactive Workers and Mortality by Covid-19","In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, among other previous ``non-pharmaceutical interventions'', on March 22, 2020 the Italian Government imposed an economic lockdown and ordered the closing of all non-essential economic activities. This paper estimates the causal effect of this measure on mortality by Covid-19 and on mobility patterns. The identification of the causal effect exploits the variation in the number of active workers across municipalities induced by the economic lockdown. The difference-in-difference empirical design compares outcomes in municipalities above and below the median variation in the share of active population before and after the lockdown within a province, also controlling for municipality-specific dynamics, daily-shocks at the provincial level and municipal unobserved characteristics. Our results show that the intensity of the economic lockdown is associated to a statistically significant reduction in mortality by Covid-19 and, in particular, for age groups between 40-64 and older. Back of the envelope calculations indicate that 4,793 deaths were avoided, in the 26 days between April 5 to April 30, in the 3,518 municipalities which experienced a more intense lockdown. Assuming linearity, a 1 percentage point reduction in the share of active population caused a 1.32 percentage points reduction in mortality by Covid-19. We also find that the economic lockdown, as expected, led to a reduction in human mobility.

However, communities throughout the US do not yet have adequate access to tests. Pharmacies are already engaged in testing, but there is capacity to greatly increase coverage. Using a facility location optimization model and willingness-to-travel estimates from US National Household Travel Survey data, we find that if COVID-19 testing became available in all US pharmacies, an estimated 94% of the US population would be willing to travel to obtain a test, if warranted. Whereas the largest chain provides high coverage in densely populated states, like Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Connecticut, independent pharmacies would be required for sufficient coverage in Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. If only 1,000 pharmacies in the US are selected to provide testing, judicious selection, using our optimization model, provides estimated access to 29 million more people than selecting pharmacies simply based on population density.

While it is essential to quantify risk and characterize transmission dynamics in closed populations using Susceptible-Infection-Recovered modeling, the investigation of the effect from worldwide pandemic cannot be neglected. This study proposes a network analysis to assess global pandemic risk by linking 164 countries in pandemic networks, where links between countries were specified by the level of 'co-movement' of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. More countries showing increase in the COVID-19 cases simultaneously will signal the pandemic prevalent over the world. The network density, clustering coefficients, and assortativity in the pandemic networks provide early warning signals of the pandemic in late February 2020. We propose a preparedness pandemic risk score for prediction and a severity risk score for pandemic control. The preparedness risk score contributed by countries in Asia is between 25% to 50% most of the time after February and America contributes close to 50% recently. The high preparedness risk contribution implies the importance of travel restrictions between those countries. The severity risk score of America is greater than 50% after May and even exceeds 75% in July, signifying that the control of COVID-19 is still worrying in America. We can keep track of the pandemic situation in each country using an online dashboard to update the pandemic risk scores and contributions.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20197020""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20197020,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
296,The Accuracy of Healthcare Worker versus Self Collected (2-in-1) Oropharyngeal and Bilateral Mid-Turbinate (OPMT) Swabs and Saliva Samples for SARS-CoV-2,"Background Self-sampling for SARS-CoV-2 would significantly raise testing capacity and reduce healthcare worker (HCW) exposure to infectious droplets personal, and protective equipment (PPE) use. Methods We conducted a diagnostic accuracy study where subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n=401) and healthy volunteers (n=100) were asked to self-swab from their oropharynx and mid-turbinate (OPMT), and self-collect saliva. The results of these samples were compared to an OPMT performed by a HCW in the same patient at the same session. Results In subjects confirmed to have COVID-19, the detection rates of the HCW-swab, self-swab, saliva, and combined self-swab plus saliva samples were 82.8%, 75.1%, 74.3% and 86.5% respectively. All samples obtained from healthy volunteers were tested negative. Compared to HCW-swab, the detection rates of a self-swab sample and saliva sample were inferior by 8.7% (95%CI: 2.4% to 15.0%, p=0.006) and 9.5% (95%CI: 3.1% to 15.8%, p=0.003) respectively. The combined detection rate of self-swab and saliva had a higher detection rate of 2.7% (95%CI: -2.6% to 8.0%, p=0.321). The sensitivity of both the self-collection methods are higher when the Ct value of the HCW swab is less than 30. The negative correctness of both the self-swab and saliva testing was 100% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%). Conclusion Our study provides evidence that detection rates of self-collected OPMT swab and saliva samples were inferior to a HCW swab, but they could still be useful testing tools in the appropriate clinical settings.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu; Joshua A Weiner; Evan M Bloch; Kirsten Littlefield; Wendy Wieland-Alter; Ruth I Connor; Peter F Wright; Sarah E Benner,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20197004""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20197004,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
297,KIM-1/TIM-1 is a Receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in Lung and Kidney,"SARS-CoV-2 precipitates respiratory distress by infection of airway epithelial cells and is often accompanied by acute kidney injury. We report that Kidney Injury Molecule-1/T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain 1 (KIM-1/TIM-1) is expressed in lung and kidney epithelial cells in COVID-19 patients and is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Human and mouse lung and kidney epithelial cells express KIM-1 and endocytose nanoparticles displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (virosomes). Uptake was inhibited both by anti-KIM-1 antibodies and by TW-37, our newly discovered inhibitor of KIM-1-mediated endocytosis. Enhanced KIM-1 expression by human kidney tubuloids increased uptake of virosomes. KIM-1 positive cells express less angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the well-known receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Using microscale thermophoresis, the EC50 for KIM-1-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) interactions, were 19 and 10 nM respectively. Thus KIM-1 is an alternative receptor to ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2.

298,A COVID-19 Nursing Home Transmission Study: sequence and metadata from weekly testing in an extensive nursing home outbreak,"Background This study aimed to assess the contribution of asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents and staff in SARS-CoV-2 transmission during a large outbreak in a Dutch nursing home. Methods Observational study in a 185-bed nursing home with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, and weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2 was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. Positive samples with a cycle threshold (CT) value below 32 were selected for sequencing. Results 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value <0.001). Median Ct-value of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624). Conclusions The frequency of a/presymptomatic residents compared to staff suggests that a/presymptomatic residents could be unrecognized symptomatic cases. However, symptomatic and presymptomatic/unrecognized symptomatic residents both have the same potential for viral shedding. The high prevalence symptomatic staff found in facility-wide testing suggests that staff has difficulty attributing their symptoms to possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Weekly testing was an effective strategy for early identification of SARS-Cov-2 cases, resulting in fast isolation and mitigation of this outbreak.",Harini Natarajan; Andrew R Crowley; Savannah E Butler; Shiwei Xu; Joshua A Weiner; Evan M Bloch; Kirsten Littlefield; Wendy Wieland-Alter; Ruth I Connor; Peter F Wright,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195396""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195396,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

However, the humoral factors that contribute to efficacy are poorly understood. This study functionally and phenotypically profiled plasma from eligible convalescent donors. In addition to viral neutralization, convalescent plasma contained antibodies capable of mediating such Fc-dependent functions as complement activation, phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SARS-CoV-2. These activities expand the antiviral functions associated with convalescent plasma and together with neutralization efficacy, could be accurately and robustly from antibody phenotypes.

300,"COVID-19 and human milk: SARS-CoV-2, antibodies, and neutralizing capacity","Background: It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother to infant during breastfeeding, and if so whether the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh this risk. This study was designed to evaluate 1) if SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in milk and on the breast of infected women, 2) concentrations of milk-borne anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 3) the capacity of milk to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Methods: We collected 37 milk samples and 70 breast swabs (before and after breast washing) from 18 women recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-qPCR. Milk was also analyzed for IgA and IgG specific for the nucleocapsid protein, receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as 2 seasonal coronaviruses using ELISA; and for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Results: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti-RBD IgA correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted. Conclusions: Our data do not support maternal-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity.

301,High-throughput quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a single-dilution homogeneous assay,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and has since spread around the world, causing a pandemic of the respiratory disease COVID-19. Detecting antibodies against the virus is an essential tool for tracking infections and developing vaccines. Such tests, primarily utilizing the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principle, can be either qualitative (reporting positive/negative results) or quantitative (reporting a value representing the quantity of specific antibodies). Quantitation is vital for determining stability or decline of antibody titers in convalescence, efficacy of different vaccination regimens, and detection of asymptomatic infections. Quantitation typically requires two-step ELISA testing, in which samples are first screened in a qualitative assay and positive samples are subsequently analyzed as a dilution series. To overcome the throughput limitations of this approach, we developed a simpler and faster system that is highly automatable and achieves quantitation in a single-dilution screening format with sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of ELISA.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni; Christopher T Williams; Emily R Adams; Luis E Cuevas; Ravi K Amaravadi; Derek C Angus; Yaseen M Arabi; Shehnoor Azhar; Lindsey R Baden; Arthur W Baker; Leila Belkhir; Thomas Benfield; Marvin A H Berrevoets; Cheng-Pin Chen; Tsung-Chia Chen; Shu-Hsing Cheng,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20195446""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20195446,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

Mitigating the risk of reopening will require widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would be greatly facilitated by simple, rapid, and inexpensive testing methods. To this end, we evaluated several protocols for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR that are simpler and less expensive than prevailing methods. First, we show that isopropanol precipitation provides an effective means of RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Second, we evaluate direct addition of NP swab samples to RT-qPCR reactions without an RNA extraction step. We describe a simple, inexpensive swab collection solution suitable for direct addition, which we validate using contrived swab samples. Third, we describe an open-source master mix for RT-qPCR and show that it permits detection of viral RNA in NP swab samples.

In this study we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 5 clinical samples obtained in Oklahoma, USA during different time points of pandemic presence in the state. One sample from the initial days of the pandemic in the state and 4 during the peak in Oklahoma were sequenced. Previously reported mutations including D614G in S gene, P4715L in ORF1ab, S194L, R203K and G204R in N gene were identified in the genomes sequenced in this study. Possible novel mutations were also detected such as G1167V in S gene, A6269S and P3371S in ORF1ab, T28I in ORF7b, G96R in ORF8.

Design or methods We conducted a cross-sectional and a prospective study among medical doctors and medical trainees at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota (Colombia) during June, July, and August to assess seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in this population was performed using CLA IgG for SARS-CoV-2. LFA IgG and IgM and ELFA IgM were also determined to explore concordance with CLA IgG. Results At baseline, 8 (2.28% 95%CI 1.16-4.43%) individuals were IgG positive for SARS-CoV-2 by CLA. At the end of the study, 21 (5.98% 95%CI 3.94-8.97%) individuals seroconverted by CLA IgG. In all, 29 individuals had IgG by CLA and of these 11 (3.13% 95%CI 1.76-5.52%) were asymptomatic. No associations with risk factors for infection were identified. CLA had moderate concordance with LFA IgG and ELFA, but minimal with LFA IgM. Conclusions Our report is one of the first in Latina America on seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in medical healthcare workers. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding focusing only on symptomatic individuals to screen this population for SARS-CoV-2 infection, since of all individuals that have evidence of previous infection many (37.93%) may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic and may contribute to infection/disease spread.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni; Christopher T Williams; Emily R Adams; Luis E Cuevas; Ravi K Amaravadi; Derek C Angus; Yaseen M Arabi,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195313""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195313,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

With best of our knowledge, no study reported physiological effect of prone position in SARS- CoV-2 infected ARDS patients. In this prospective observational study, data of n=20 consecutive laboratory confirmed SARS- CoV-2 patients with severe ARDS as per Berlin definition was included. Data of 20 patients analyzed with a median (Interquartile range, IQR) age of 56 (45.5- 67) y and median (IQR) P/F ratio of 56 (54- 66) with a median (IQR) PEEP of 12 (12- 14) before initiation of prone position.

306,"Relations between demographic, geographic, and environmental statistics, and the spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Italy","BACKGROUND: Since January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has raged around the world, causing nearly a million deaths and hundreds of severe economic crises. In this scenario, Italy has been one of the most affected countries. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated significant correlations between COVID-19 cases and demographic, geographical, and environmental statistics of each Italian region from February 26 to August 12, 2020. We further investigated the link between the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and 10 concentrations before the lockdown in Lombardy. METHODS: All demographic data were obtained from the AdminStat Italia website, and geographic data were from the Il Meteo website. The collection frequency was one week. Data on PM2.5 and PM10 average daily concentrations were collected from previously published articles. We used Pearson's coefficients to correlate the quantities that followed a normal distribution, and Spearman's coefficient to correlate quantities that did not follow a normal distribution. RESULTS: We found significant strong correlations between COVID-19 cases and population number in 60.0% of the regions. We also found a significant strong correlation between the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the various regions and their latitude, and with the historical averages (last 30 years) of their minimum temperatures. We identified a significant strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases until August 12 and the average daily concentrations of PM2.5 in Lombardy until February 29, 2020. No significant correlation with PM10 was found in the same periods. However, we found that 40 g/m^3 for PM2.5 and 50 g/m^3 PM10 are plausible thresholds beyond which particulate pollution clearly favors the spread of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Since SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with historical minimum temperatures and PM10 and 2.5, health authorities are urged to monitor pollution levels and to invest in precautions for the arrival of autumn. Furthermore, we suggest creating awareness campaigns for the recirculation of air in enclosed places and to avoid exposure to the cold.

307,Apparent reductions in COVID-19 Case Fatality Rates reflect changes in average age of those testing positive.,"Numbers of COVID-19 infections are rising in many countries, while death and hospitalisation rates remain low. Infection Fatality Rates (IFR) for individual year classes calculated from seroprevalence data and the ages of those dying in England show a very strong log-linear relationship with age, and allow us to predict fatality rates for those testing positive on each day based on their ages. Since the peak of the epidemic, reductions in the ages of cases account for an eight fold fall in fatality rates. Over the same period, increased testing intensity appears to have increased infections detected amongst the most vulnerable by a factor of at least five, and between 15 and 24 fold in the population as a whole. Together these two factors are sufficient to explain the large observed change in the ratio of deaths to reported cases. We can also use these methods to give a more precise early warning system of future increases in mortality rates than raw case numbers. Although case numbers are currently increasing markedly, a continuing reduction in numbers of older individuals being infected means that the predicted increase in mortality rates is much slower.",Thomas Edwards,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197160""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197160,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
308,Detectability of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation,"Background: Laboratory diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection combined with tracing/quarantine for contacts of infected individuals affects the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and the levels of related mortality. Moreover, not all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population are detected (laboratory diagnosed). Here, we examine the relation between detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. the percent of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population) and levels of mortality for COVID-19 for the 85 different regions (federal subjects) of the Russian Federation. Methods: Lower case-fatality rate (CFR, the proportion of deaths among reported COVID-19 cases in the population) corresponds to higher detectability of the SARS-COV-2 infection. We used data from the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) on the number of detected COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the 85 different regions of the Russian Federation to examine the correlation between case-fatality rates and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results: The correlation between case-fatality rates for cases/deaths reported by Sep. 17, 2020 and rates of mortality for COVID-19 per 100,000 for deaths reported by Sep. 17, 2020 in different regions of the Russian Federation is 0.68 (0.55,0.78). The region with both the highest COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 and the highest CFR (lowest detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection) is the city of St. Petersburg. Conclusions: Detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the factors that affects the levels of mortality for COVID-19 in Russia. Regions of the Russian Federation with relatively low detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g. those regions for which the case-fatality rate is above the median value of 1.2% for the case-fatality rate in different regions of the Russian Federation on Sep. 17, 2020 [3]) ought to increase testing for SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and diminish the related mortality.",Thomas Edwards,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197194""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197194,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
309,In the long shadow of our best intentions: model-based assessment of the consequences of school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic,"As the United States grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a particularly thorny set of questions surrounds the reopening of K-12 schools and universities. The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection. While the higher prevalence of asymptomatic disease among children makes symptom-based isolation strategies ineffective, asymptomatic patients do not in fact carry a reduced viral load. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of systematic surveillance testing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days. At this point, one or more large disease clusters can be expected to be detected, forcing schools to close again. These disease clusters, in turn, can be expected to propagate through the community, with potentially hundreds to thousands of additional cases resulting from each individual school cluster. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Given the current circumstances in the United States, the most likely outcome in the late fall is that students will be deprived of the benefits of in-person learning while having incurred a significant risk to themselves and their communities.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni; Christopher T Williams,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197400""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197400,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
310,Genomic epidemiology of the Los Angeles COVID-19 outbreak,"Los Angeles (LA) County has sustained a large outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To learn about the transmission history of SARS-CoV-2 in LA County, we sequenced 142 viral genomes from unique patients seeking care at UCLA Health System. 86 of these genomes are from samples collected before April 19, 2020. We found that the early outbreak in LA, as in other international air travel hubs, was seeded by multiple introductions of strains from Asia and Europe. We identified a US-specific strain, B.1.43, which has been found predominantly in California and Washington State. While samples from LA County carry the ancestral B.1.43 genome, viral genomes from neighbouring counties in California and from counties in Washington State carry additional mutations, suggesting a potential origin of B.1.43 in Southern California. We quantified the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 over time, and found evidence that the public health measures put in place in LA County to control the virus were effective at preventing transmission, but may have been undermined by the many introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the region. Our work demonstrates that genome sequencing can be a powerful tool for investigating outbreaks and informing the public health response.

312,"Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Karnataka State, South India: Transmission dynamics of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic infections","Background: In this report, we describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, specifically examining how the symptomatic persons drove the transmission in the state of Karnataka, India, during the lockdown phase. Methods: The study included all the cases reported from March 8 to May 31, 2020 in the state. Any person with history of international or domestic travel from high burden states, those presenting with Influenza-like or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and high-risk contacts of COVID19 cases, who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive were included. Detailed analysis based on contact tracing data available from line-list of the state surveillance unit was performed using cluster analysis software package. Findings: Amongst the 3404 COVID-19 positive cases, 3096 (91%) were asymptomatic while 308 (9%) were symptomatic. Majority of the asymptomatic cases were in the age range of 16-50 years while symptomatic cases were between 31-65 years. Most of those affected were males. Cluster analysis of 822 cases indicated that the secondary attack rate, size of the cluster (dispersion) and occurrence of overt clinical illness is significantly higher when the index case in a cluster was symptomatic compared to an asymptomatic. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases transmit the infection; however, the main driving force behind the spread of infection within the state was significantly higher from symptomatic cases. This has major implications for policies related to testing. Active search for symptomatic cases, subjecting them to testing and treatment should be prioritized for containing the spread of COVID-19.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni; Christopher T Williams; Emily R Adams; Luis E Cuevas; Ravi K Amaravadi,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20196501""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20196501,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

314,Identification of potential biomarkers and inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed many health systems globally. Here, we aim to identify biological markers and associated biological processes of COVID-19 using a bioinformatics approach to elucidate their potential pathogenesis. The gene expression profile of the GSE152418 dataset was originally produced by using the high-throughput Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were applied to identify functional categories and biochemical pathways. KEGG and GO results suggested that biological pathways such as Cancer pathways and Insulin pathways were mostly affected in the development of COVID-19. Moreover, we identified several genes including EP300, CREBBP, and POLR2A were involved in the virus activities in COVID-19 patients. We further predicted that some inhibitors may have the potential to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the L1000FWD analysis.

315,Environmental and climatic impact on the infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru,"The role of the environment and climate in the transmission and case-fatality rates of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated. Elevation and air quality are believed to be significant factors in the current development of the pandemic, but the influence of additional environmental factors remain unclear. In this study, we explored the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and mortality cases with climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water vapor pressure, wind), environmental data (elevation, NDVI, PM2.5 and NO2 concentration), and population density in Peru. Using the data from confirmed cases of infection from 1287 districts and confirmed cases of mortality in 479 districts, we used Spearman's correlations to assess the correlation between environmental and climatic factors with cumulative infection cases, cumulative mortality and case-fatality rate. We also explored district cases by the ecozones of coast, sierra, high montane forest and lowland rainforest. Multiple linear regression models indicate elevation, mean solar radiation, air quality, population density and green cover are influential factors in the distribution of infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru. The case-fatality rate was weakly associated with elevation. Our results also strongly suggest that exposure to poor air quality is a significant factor in the mortality of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 below the age of 30. We conclude that environmental and climatic factors do play a significant role in the transmission and case-fatality rates in Peru, however further study is required to see if these relationships are maintained over time.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20196170""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.20196170,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
316,Factors associated with the spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 in France: a nationwide ecological study,"Like in many countries and regions, spread of the COVID 19 pandemic has exhibited important spatial heterogeneity across France, one of the most affected countries so far. To better understand factors associated with incidence, mortality and lethality heterogeneity across the 96 administrative departments of metropolitan France, we thus conducted a geoepidemiological analysis based on publicly available data, using hierarchical ascendant classification (HAC) on principal component analysis (PCA) of multidimensional variables, and multivariate analyses with generalized additive models (GAM). Our results confirm a marked spatial heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID 19 incidence and mortality, following the North East / South West diffusion of the epidemic. The delay elapsed between the first COVID-19 associated death and the onset of the national lockdown on March 17th, 2020, appeared positively associated with in-hospital incidence, mortality and lethality. Mortality was also strongly associated with incidence. Mortality and lethality rates were significantly higher in departments with older population, but they were not significantly associated with the number of intensive-care beds available in 2018. We did not find any significant association between incidence, mortality or lethality rates and incidence of new chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations in pharmacies either, nor between COVID 19 incidence and climate, nor between economic indicators and in-hospital COVID 19 incidence or mortality.

318,Cost-effective serological test to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2: ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (Spike-RBDN318-V510) expressed in Escherichia coli,"Massive worldwide serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 is needed to determine the extent of virus exposure in a particular region, the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infected persons, and the duration and extent of immunity after infection. To achieve this aim, the development and production of reliable and cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 antigens is critical. Here, we report the bacterial production of the peptide S-RBDN318-V510, which contains the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We purified this peptide using a straightforward approach involving bacterial lysis, his-tag mediated affinity chromatography, and imidazole-assisted refolding. The antigen performances of S RBDN318 V510 and a commercial full-length spike protein were compared in two distinct ELISAs. In direct ELISAs, where the antigen was directly bound to the ELISA surface, both antigens discriminated sera from non-exposed and exposed individuals. However, the discriminating resolution was better in ELISAs that used the full-spike antigen than the S-RBDN318-V510. Attachment of the antigens to the ELISA surface using a layer of anti-histidine antibodies gave equivalent resolution for both S-RBDN318-V510 and the full length spike protein. Our results demonstrate that ELISA-functional SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be produced in bacterial cultures. S-RBDN318-V510 is amenable to massive production and may represent a cost-effective alternative to the use of structurally more complex antigens in serological COVID-19 testing.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni; Christopher T Williams; Emily R Adams; Luis E Cuevas; Ravi K Amaravadi; Derek C Angus,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195503""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20195503,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
319,The impact of vital signs on the death of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Assessing the impact of vital signs (blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) on the death of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia would provide a simple and convenient method for the monitoring of subsequent illness, and therefore, in some degree reduce treatment costs and increase the cure rate clinically. Methods: Six databases were retrieved. The software R 3.6.2 was used for meta-analysis of the included literature. Results: 12 studies were included, which comprise 8996 patients affected with COVID-19 infection. The meta-analysis study found that blood pressure (MAP, SBP and DBP), heart rate, respiration rate and SpO2 are the risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Among them, the increase in MAP and the decrease in SpO2 have the greatest impact on the death of patients with COVID-19 [MAP: MD = 5.66, 95% CI (0.34, 10.98), SpO2: MD = -5.87, 95% CI (-9.17, -2.57), P = 0.0005]. However, comparing the body temperature of the death group and the survival group found that the body temperature was not statistically significant between the two groups [body temperature: MD = 0.21, 95% CI (-0.01, 0.43), P = 0.0661]. Conclusion: The increase in MAP, heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as the decrease in SBP, DBP and SpO2 are all independent risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19. These factors are simple and easy to monitor, and individualized treatment can be given to patients in time, reducing the mortality rate and improving treatment efficiency.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20196709""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20196709,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

We aimed to estimate the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on survival in COVID-19 from all currently available RCT evidence, published and unpublished. Methods: Rapid meta-analysis of ongoing, completed, or discontinued RCTs on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients (protocol: https://osf.io/QESV4/). We systematically identified published and unpublished RCTs by September 14, 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, PubMed, Cochrane COVID-19 registry). All-cause mortality was extracted (publications/preprints) or requested from investigators and combined in random-effects meta-analyses, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), separately for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. Prespecified subgroup analyses included patient setting, diagnostic confirmation, control type, and publication status. Results: Sixty-two trials were potentially eligible. We included 16 unpublished trials (1596 patients) and 10 publications/preprints (6317 patients). The combined summary OR on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine was 1.08 (95%CI: 0.99, 1.18; I-square=0%; 24 trials; 7659 patients) and for chloroquine 1.77 (95%CI: 0.15, 21.13, I-square=0%; 4 trials; 307 patients). We identified no subgroup effects. Conclusions: We found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine on the survival of COVID-19 patients.

321,Urban rail transport and SARS-CoV-2 infections: an ecological study in Lisbon Metropolitan Area,"Introduction: Large number of passengers, limited space and shared surfaces can transform public transportation into a hub of epidemic spread. This study was conducted to investigate whether proximity to railway stations, a proxy for utilization, was associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection across small-areas of Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Portugal). Methods: The number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections from March 2 until July 5, 2020 at parish-level was obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. We used a Geographic Information System to estimate proximity to railway stations from the six railway lines operating in the area. Then, we fitted a quasi-Poisson generalized linear regression model to estimate the relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI). Results: Between May 2 and July 5, 2020, there were a total of 17,168 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, with wide disparities between parishes. Globally, parishes near one of the railway lines (Sintra) presented significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rates (RR=1.42, 95%CI 1.16, 1.75) compared to those parishes located far away from railway stations, while the opposite happened for parishes near other railway lines (Sado/Fertagus), whose infection rates were significantly lower than those observed in parishes located far away from railway stations (RR=0.66, 95%CI 0.50, 0.87). However, the associations varied according to the stage of the epidemic and according to mitigation measures in place. Regression results also revealed an increasing influence of socioeconomic deprivation on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Conclusions: We found no consistent association between proximity to railway stations and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the most affected metropolitan area of the country, suggesting that other factors (e.g. socioeconomic deprivation) might play a more prominent role in the epidemic dynamics.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20195776""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20195776,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True

We report the seroprevalence of total immunoglobulin directed against the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in US blood donors. Methods Unique non-CCP donor sera from June 1-July 31, 2020 were tested with the Ortho VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total immunoglobulin assay (positive: signal-to-cutoff (S/C) =>1). Donor age, sex, race/ethnicity, ABO/RhD, education, and experience were compared to June and July 2019. Multivariate regressions were conducted to identify demographics associated with the presence of antibodies and with S/C values. Results Unique donors (n=252,882) showed an overall seroprevalence of 1.83% in June (1.37%) and July (2.26%), with the highest prevalence in northern New Jersey (7.3%). In a subset of donors with demographic information (n=189,565), higher odds of antibody reactivity were associated with non-Hispanic Native American/Alaskan (NH-NAA/A) and Black (NH-B), and Hispanic (H) race/ethnicity, age 18-64, middle school or lesser education, blood Group A, and never or non-recent donor status. In positive donors (n=2,831), antibody signal was associated with male sex, race/ethnicity (NH-NAA/A, NH-B and H) and geographic location. Conclusions Seroprevalence remains low in US blood donors but varies significantly by region. Temporal trends in reactivity may be used to gauge the effectiveness of public health measures. Before generalizing these data from healthy donors to the general population however, rates must be corrected for false positive test results among low prevalence test subjects and adjusted to match the wider demography.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20195131""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.20195131,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
323,COVID-19 pediatric mortality rates are heterogenous between countries,"Introduction: Severe COVID-19 is infrequent in children, with a lethality rate of about 0.08%. This study aims to explore differences in the pediatric mortality rate between countries. Methods: Countries with populations over 5 million that report COVID-19 deaths disaggregated data by quinquennial or decennial age groups were analyzed. Data were extracted from COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Age Database, national ministries of health, and the World Health Organization. Results: 23 countries were included in the analysis. Pediatric mortality varied from 0 to 12.1 deaths per million people of the corresponding age group, with the highest rate in Peru. In most countries, deaths were more frequent in the 0-4 years old age group, except for Brazil. The pediatric/ general COVID-19 mortality showed a great variation between countries and ranged from 0 (Republic of Korea) to 10.4% (India). Pediatric and Pediatric/general COVID mortality have a strong correlation with 2018 neonatal mortality (r=0.77, p<0.001 and r= 0.88, p<0.001 respectively), while it has a moderate or absent (r=0.47, p=0.02 and r=0.19, p=0.38, respectively) correlation with COVID-19 mortality in the general population. Conclusions: There is an important heterogenicity in pediatric COVI-19 mortality between countries that parallels historical neonatal mortality.

Data were pooled from Covid Prison Project and multiple publicly available national and state level sources. Data analyses consisted of standard epidemiologic and demographic estimates. A single case study was included to generate a more in-depth and multi-faceted understanding of COVID-19 mortality in prisons. The increase in crude COVID-19 mortality rates for the prison population has outpaced the rates for the general population. People in prison experienced a significantly higher mortality burden compared to the general population (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 2.75; 95% confidence interval = 2.54, 2.96). For a handful of states (n = 5), these disparities were more extreme, with SMRs ranging from 5.55 to 10.56. Four states reported COVID-19 related death counts that are more than 50% of expected deaths from all-causes in a calendar year.

Objective: To establish a preliminary expert stakeholder perspective on the relative importance of pandemic immunisation strategies for different COVID-19 pandemic scenarios at the time of initial COVID-19 vaccine availability. Methods: A survey was conducted by an email process from July 22 to August 14, 2020. Stakeholders included clinical and public health expert groups, provincial and territorial committees and national Indigenous groups, patient and community advocacy representatives and experts, health professional associations, and federal government departments in Canada. Survey results were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: Of 156 stakeholders contacted, 74 surveys were completed for a participation rate of 47.4%. During an anticipated period of initial vaccine scarcity for all pandemic scenarios, stakeholders generally considered the most important immunisation strategy to be protecting those who are most vulnerable to severe illness and death from COVID-19. This was followed in importance by the strategies to protect healthcare capacity, and to minimise transmission of COVID-19. In this supply constrained context, an immunisation strategy to protect critical infrastructure was considered the least important. Conclusion: The findings of this study provide a timely, preliminary Canadian expert perspective on priority COVID-19 pandemic immunisation strategies to guide early public health planning for an eventual COVID-19 immunisation program.

327,COPD in the time of COVID-19: An analysis of acute exacerbations and reported behavioural changes in patients with COPD,"ABSTRACT Introduction: The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and lockdown measures, on acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the change in AECOPD treatment frequency during the first six weeks of lockdown in the UK compared with 2019 and assess changes in self-reported behaviour and well-being. Methods: In this observational study patients with established COPD were recruited. Exacerbation frequency was measured in the first six weeks of COVID lockdown and compared with the same period in 2019 using electronic health records. A telephone survey was used to assess changes in anxiety, inhaler adherence, physical activity, shopping and visitor behaviour during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods compared to normal. Results: 160 participants were recruited (mean [SD] age 67.3 [8.1] years, 88 [55%] male, FEV1 34.3 [13] % predicted) and 140 [88%] reported at least one AECOPD in the previous year. Significantly more community treated exacerbations were observed in 2020 compared with 2019 (126 vs 99, p=0.026). The increase was as a result of multiple courses of treatment, with a similar proportion of patients receiving at least one course (34.4% vs 33.8%). During 'lockdown' participants reported significantly increased anxiety, adherence to their preventative inhalers, and good adherence to shielding advice (all p<0.001). A significant reduction in self-reported physical activity and visitors was reported (both p<0.001). Discussion: Treatment for AECOPD events increased during the first six weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK compared to 2019. This was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and significant behavioural change.",Thomas Edwards; Victor S Santos; Anne L Wilson; Ana I Cubas-Atienzar; Konstantina Kontogianni; Christopher T Williams; Emily R Adams,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197202""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197202,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,,True
328,THE REMOTE ANALYSIS OF BREATH SOUND IN COVID-19 PATIENTS: A SERIES OF CLINICAL CASES,"Background: Respiratory sounds have been recognized as a possible indicator of behavior and health. Computer analysis of these sounds can indicate of characteristic sound changes caused by COVID-19 and can be used for diagnosis of this illness. Purpose: The communication aim is development of fast remote computer-assistance diagnosis of COVID-19, based on analysis of respiratory sounds. Materials and Methods: Fast Fourier transform (FFT) was applied for analyses of respiratory sounds recorded near the mouth of 9 COVID-19 patients and 4 healthy volunteers. Sampling rate was 48 kHz. Results: Comparing of FFT spectrums of the respiratory sounds of the patients and volunteers we proposed numerical healthy-ill criterions. Conclusions: The proposed computer method, based on analysis of the FFT spectrums of respiratory sounds of the patients and volunteers, allows one to automatically diagnose COVID-19 with sufficiently high diagnostic values.

329,"Variation of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads by sample type, disease severity and time: a systematic review","Background. To describe whether SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (VLs) and cycle thresholds (CTs) vary by sample type, disease severity and symptoms duration. Methods. Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, BioRxiv and MedRxiv. Studies reporting individual SARS-CoV-2 VLs and/or CT values from biological samples. Paired reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles. CT values and VLs distributions were described by sample type, disease severity and time from symptom onset. Differences between groups were examined using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests (post-hoc test). The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Tools. Results. 14 studies reported CT values, 8 VLs and 2 CTs and VLs, resulting in 432 VL and 873 CT data points. VLs were higher in saliva and sputum (medians 4.7x108 and 6.5x104 genomes per ml, respectively) than in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs (medians 1.7x102 and 4.8x103). Combined naso/oropharyngeal swabs had lower CT values (i.e. higher VLs) than single site samples (p=<0.0001). CT values were also lower in asymptomatic individuals and patients with severe COVID-19 (median CT 30 for both) than among patients with moderate and mild symptoms (31.4 and 31.3, respectively). Stool samples were reported positive for a longer period than other specimens. Conclusion. VLs are higher in saliva and sputum and in individuals who are asymptomatic of with severe COVID-19.

330,Investigating the implications of COVID-19 for the rural and remote population of Northern Ontario using a mathematical model,"Background: COVID-19 has the potential to disproportionately affect the rural, remote, and Indigenous populations who typically have a worse health status and live in substandard housing, often with overcrowding. Our aim is to investigate the potential effect of COVID-19 on intensive care unit (ICU) resources and mortality in northwestern Ontario. Methods: This study was conducted in northwestern Ontario which has a population of 230,000. A set of differential equations were used to represent a modified Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model with urban and rural hospital resources (i.e., ICU and hospital beds). Rural patients requiring ICU care flowed into the urban ICU. Sensitivity analyses were used to investigate the effect of poorer health status (i.e., increased hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality) and overcrowding (i.e., increased contact rate) in the rural population as compared to the urban population. Physical distancing within the urban population was modelled as a decreased contact rate. Results: At the highest contact rate, the peak in daily active cases, ICU bed requirements and mortality was higher and occurred earlier than lower contact rates. The urban population with a lower contact rate and baseline health status had a lower predicted prevalence of active cases and lower mortality than the rural population. Interpretation: An increased contact rate and worse health status in the rural population will likely increase the required ICU resources and mortality as compared to the urban population. Rural populations will likely be affected disproportionately more than urban populations.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort in HCWs who had a high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subject without PPE. Daily symptoms were self-reported for 30 days, nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were performed at inclusion and at days 3, 5, 7 and 12, SARS-CoV-2 serology was assessed at inclusion and at day 30. Confirmed infection was defined by positive RT-PCR or seroconversion, and possible infection by one general and one specific symptom for two consecutive days. Results: Between February 5th and May 30th, 2020, 154 HCWs were enrolled within 14 days following one high-risk exposure to either a hospital patient (70/154; 46.1%) and/or a colleague (95/154; 62.5%). At day 30, 25.0% had a confirmed infection (37/148; 95%CI, 18.4%; 32.9%), and 43.9% (65/148; 95%CI, 35.9%; 52.3%) had a confirmed or possible infection. Factors independently associated with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection were being a pharmacist or administrative assistant rather than being from medical staff (adjusted OR (aOR)=3.8, CI95%=1.3;11.2, p=0.01), and exposure to a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient rather than exposure to a SARS-CoV-2-infected colleague (aOR=2.6, CI95%=1.2;5.9, p=0.02). Among the 26 HCWs with a SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swab, 7 (26.9%) had no symptom at the time of the RT-PCR positivity. Conclusions: The proportion of HCWs with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection was high.

332,How do the general population behave with facemasks to prevent COVID-19 in the community?,"IMPORTANCE The appropriate use of facemasks, recommended or mandated by authorities, is critical to protect the community and prevent the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the frequency and quality of facemask use in general populations of different socio-spatial backgrounds. DESIGN A multi-site observational study carried out from 25 June 2020 to 21 July 2020. SETTING The observations were carried out in 43 different locations in a region in the west of France, representing various areas: rural and urban, indoor and outdoor, and in areas where masks were mandated or not. An observer was positioned at a predetermined place, facing a landmark, and collected information about the use of facemasks and socio-demographic data. PARTICIPANTS All individual passing between the observer and the landmark were included. EXPOSURE The observer collected information on whether a mask was worn, the type of mask used, the quality of the positioning, gender, and the age category of each individual. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomes were the use of a facemask and the quality of the positioning. Factors associated with these outcomes were identified. RESULTS A total of 3354 observations were recorded. A facemask was worn by 56.4% (n=1892) of individuals, varying from 49% (n=1359) in non-mandatory areas and 91.7% (n=533) in mandatory areas, including surgical facemasks (56.8%, n=1075) and cloth masks (43.2%, n=817). The facemask was correctly positioned in 75.2% (n=1422) of cases. The factors independently associated with wearing a facemask were being indoors (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.44), being in a mandatory area (aOR, 0.14; 95%CI, 0.10-0.20), female gender (aOR, 0.57; 95%CI, 0.49-0.66), and age >40 years (aOR, 0.54; 95%CI, 0.46-0.63). The factors independently associated with correct mask position were rural location (aOR, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.97-0.98), being in an indoor area (aOR, 0.49; 95%CI, 0.38-0.65), use of a cloth mask (aOR, 0.65; 95%CI, 0.52-0.81), and age >40 years (aOR, 0.61; 95%CI 0.49-0.76).

Methods Participants in a survey on COVID-19 from an existing consortium of three general adult population cohorts living in the Ile-de-France (IDF) or Grand Est (GE), two regions with high rate of COVID-19, or in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine (NA), with a low rate, were asked to take a dried-blood spot (DBS) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment. The primary outcome was a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG result against the spike protein of the virus (ELISA-S). The secondary outcomes were a positive ELISA IgG against the nucleocapsid protein (ELISA-NP), anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies titers >=40 (SN), and predicted positivity obtained from a multiple imputation model (MI). Prevalence estimates were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification methods. Findings Between May 4, 2020 and June 23, 2020, 16,000 participants were asked to provide DBS, and 14,628 were included in the analysis, 983 with a positive ELISA-S, 511 with a positive ELISA-NP, 424 with SN>=40 and 941 (Standard Deviation=31) with a positive MI. Adjusted estimates of seroprevalence (positive ELISA-S) were 10.0% (95%CI 9.1%;10.9%) in IDF, 9.0% (95%CI 7.7%; 10.2%) in GE and 3.1% (95%CI 2.4%; 3.7%), in NA. The adjusted prevalence of positive ELISA-NP, SN and MI were 5.7%, 5.0% and 10.0% in IDF, 6.0%, 4.3% and 8.6% in GE, and 0.6%, 1.3% and 2.5% in NA, respectively. A higher seroprevalence was observed in younger participants and when at least one child or adolescent lived in the same household. A lower seroprevalence was observed in smokers compared to non-smokers.

335,RPA-Based Method For The Detection Of SARS-CoV2,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease with significant mortality, morbidity, and far-reaching economic and social disruptions. Testing is key in the fight against COVID-19 disease. The gold standard for COVID-19 testing is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. RT-PCR requires highly specialized, expensive, and advanced bulky equipment that is difficult to use in the field or in a point of care setting. There is need for a simpler, inexpensive, convenient, portable and accurate test. Our aims were to: (i) design primer-probe pairs for use in isothermal amplification of the S1, ORF3 and ORF8 regions of the SARS-CoV2 virus; (ii) optimize the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay for the isothermal amplification of the named SARS-COV2 regions; (iii) detect amplification products on a lateral flow device. and (ii) perform a pilot field validation of RPA on RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: Assay validation was done at the National Reference Lab (NRL) at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) in Rwanda. Results were compared to an established, WHO-approved rRT-PCR laboratory protocol. The assay provides a faster and cheaper alternative to rRT-PCR with 100% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and positive and negative predictive agreements of 100% and 93% respectively. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-field and comparative laboratory validation of RPA for COVID-19 disease in low resource settings. Further standardization will be required for deployment of the RPA assay in field settings. Keywords: Recombinase Polymerase Amplification, COVID-19",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early CP therapy in COVID-19 progression. Methods: Open-label, single-center, randomized clinical trial performed in an academic center in Santiago, Chile from May 10, 2020, to July 18, 2020, with final follow-up August 17, 2020. The trial included patients hospitalized within the first 7 days of COVID-19 symptoms onset, presenting risk factors for illness progression and not on mechanical ventilation. The intervention consisted in immediate CP (early plasma group) versus no CP unless developing pre-specified criteria of deterioration (deferred plasma group). Additional standard treatment was allowed in both arms. The primary outcome was a composite of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization for >14 days or death. Key secondary outcomes included: time to respiratory failure, days of mechanical ventilation, hospital length-of-stay, mortality at 30 days, and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR clearance rate. Results: Of 58 randomized patients (mean age, 65.8 years, 50% male), 57 (98.3%) completed the trial. A total of 13 (43.3%) participants from the deferred group received plasma based on clinical aggravation. We found no benefit in the primary outcome (32.1% vs 33.3%, OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.32-2.84, p>0.99) in the early versus deferred CP group. In-hospital mortality rate was 17.9% vs 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54-17.2, p=0.25), mechanical ventilation 17.9% vs 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54-17.2, p=0.25), and prolonged hospitalization 21.4% vs 30% (OR 0.64, 95%CI, 0.19-2.1, p=0.55) in early versus deferred CP group, respectively. Viral clearance rate on day 3 (26% vs 8%, p=0.20) and day 7 (38% vs 19%, p=0.37) did not differ between groups.

337,Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension: a propensity score-matched cohort study in primary care,"Introduction A significant proportion of patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) have hypertension and are treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme I inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs). These medications have been postulated to influence susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this study was to assess a possible association between prescription of RAS inhibitors and the incidence of COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. Methods We conducted a propensity-score matched cohort study to assess the incidence of COVID-19 among patients with hypertension who were prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared to patients treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in a large UK-based primary care database (The Health Improvement Network). We estimated crude incidence rates for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 among those prescribed ACE inhibitors, ARBs and CCBs. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to produce adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19 comparing patients prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs to those prescribed CCBs. We further assessed all-cause mortality as a secondary outcome and a composite of accidents, trauma or fractures as a negative control outcome to assess for residual confounding. Results In the propensity score matched analysis, 83 of 18,895 users (0.44%) of ACE inhibitors developed COVID-19 over 8,923 person-years, an incidence rate of 9.3 per 1000 person-years. 85 of 18,895 (0.45%) users of CCBs developed COVID-19 over 8,932 person-years, an incidence rate of 9.5 per 1000 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratio for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 for users of ACE inhibitors compared to CCBs was 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). 79 out of 10,623 users (0.74%) of ARBs developed COVID-19 over 5010 person-years, an incidence rate of 15.8 per 1000 person-years, compared to 11.6 per 1000 person-years among users of CCBs. The adjusted hazard ratio for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 for users of ARBs compared to CCBs was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.95). There were no significant associations between use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality, compared to use of CCBs. We found no evidence of significant residual confounding with the negative control analysis. Conclusion Current use of ACE inhibitors was not associated with the risk of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 whereas use of ARBs was associated with a statistically non-significant 38% relative increase in risk compared to use of CCBs. However, no significant associations were observed between prescription of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality during the peak of the pandemic.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

338,The Peak of COVID-19 in India,"Abstract Introduction: Following the USA, India ranks the second position in the world for COVID 19 cases with the highest number of daily confirmed cases since September 2020. The peak of COVID-19 cases is the most warranted feature for understanding the curvature of COVID 19 cases. Aim: This study aims to analyse the growth rates of the daily confirmed cases and to provide an expected count of the peak of daily confirmed cases. Data: We retrieved data from an Application Programming Interface portal https://www.covid19india.org/ which is open access and publicly available. Methods: Exponential model was applied to estimate the growth rates of daily confirmed cases. The estimated growth rates were used for calculating the doubling time. The Lotka Euler method was applied to calculate the effective reproduction rate. SARIMA model was developed for the growth rates to predict daily confirmed cases. Results: Results show the best fit of the exponential model over the daily confirmed cases. The growth rates estimated from the exponential model shows an unsteady, modest decline. Doubling time shows a linear increase. The effective reproduction rate declined from 3.6 persons in the third week of March 2020 to 1.14 persons at the end of August 2020. The diagnosis of the developed SARIMA model confirmed no trends in the residuals, no outliers, and nearly constant variance. The forecast suggests the peak value of daily confirmed cases would waver around 105,000 counts in the last week of September 2020. The cumulative COVID-19 cases would account for approximately 105 lakhs at the end of December 2020. Conclusion: The exponential model unravels a shift and a modest decline in the growth of daily confirmed cases. The trends in R(t) show analogue with the trends in growth rates of daily confirmed cases. The study shows that the SARIMA model is suitable for projecting daily confirmed cases. The results shed light on the understanding of the trends and epidemiological stage of COVID-19 disease, in the cognisance of the peak. Contribution: This study based on moments of the distribution of the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease unravels the uncertainty about the peak and curvature of COVID-19 disease.

339,The COVID-19 immune landscape is dynamically and reversibly correlated with disease severity,"Despite a rapidly growing body of literature on COVID-19, our understanding of the immune correlates of disease severity, course and outcome remains poor. Using mass cytometry, we assessed the immune landscape in longitudinal whole blood specimens from 59 patients presenting with acute COVID-19, and classified based on maximal disease severity. Hospitalized patients negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used as controls. We found that the immune landscape in COVID-19 forms three dominant clusters, which correlate with disease severity. Longitudinal analysis identified a pattern of productive innate and adaptive immune responses in individuals who have a moderate disease course, whereas those with severe disease have features suggestive of a protracted and dysregulated immune response. Further, we identified coordinate immune alterations accompanying clinical improvement and decline that were also seen in patients who received IL-6 pathway blockade. The hospitalized COVID-19 negative cohort allowed us to identify immune alterations that were shared between severe COVID-19 and other critically ill patients. Collectively, our findings indicate that selection of immune interventions should be based in part on disease presentation and early disease trajectory due to the profound differences in the immune response in those with mild to moderate disease and those with the most severe disease.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

340,Discovery of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral synergy between remdesivir and approved drugs in human lung cells,"The SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an ongoing global pandemic with currently 29 million confirmed cases and close to a million deaths. At this time, there are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19, but Emergency Use Authorization has been granted for remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside analog. However, remdesivir is only moderately efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in the clinic, and improved treatment strategies are urgently needed. To accomplish this goal, we devised a strategy to identify compounds that act synergistically with remdesivir in preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication. We conducted combinatorial high-throughput screening in the presence of submaximal remdesivir concentrations, using a human lung epithelial cell line infected with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. We identified 20 approved drugs that act synergistically with remdesivir, many with favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Strongest effects were observed with established antivirals, Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5 A (HCV NS5A) inhibitors velpatasvir and elbasvir. Combination with their partner drugs sofosbuvir and grazoprevir further increased efficacy, increasing remdesivirs apparent potency 25-fold. We therefore suggest that the FDA-approved Hepatitis C therapeutics Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Zepatier (elbasvir/grazoprevir) should be fast-tracked for clinical evaluation in combination with remdesivir to improve treatment of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

341,A trimeric human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent in vitro,"Effective intervention strategies are urgently needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a carboxypeptidase that forms a dimer and serves as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It is also a key negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), conserved in mammals, which modulates vascular functions. We report here the properties of a trimeric ACE2 variant, created by a structure-based approach, with binding affinity of ~60 pM for the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, while preserving the wildtype peptidase activity as well as the ability to block activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 in the RAS. Moreover, the engineered ACE2 potently inhibits infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. These results suggest that engineered, trimeric ACE2 may be a promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for treating COVID-19.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

Here we show that a particularly vulnerable population with neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 harbor an influx of inflammatory cytokines within the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of viral neuro-invasion. The majority of these inflammatory mediators are driven by type 2 interferon and are known to induce neuronal injury in other disease models. Levels of matrix metalloproteinase-10 within the spinal fluid correlate with the degree of neurologic dysfunction. Furthermore, this neuroinflammatory process persists weeks following convalescence from the acute respiratory infection.

343,How the clinical research community responded to the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of the COVID-19 clinical studies in ClinicalTrials.gov,"Objective: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), broke out in December 2019, is a global pandemic. Rapidly in the past few months, a large number of clinical studies have been initiated worldwide to find effective therapeutics, vaccines, and preventive strategies. In this study, we aim to understand the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research and identify the gaps and issues that may cause difficulty in recruitment and the lack of population representativeness. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 2,034 COVID-19 studies registered in the largest public registry - ClinicalTrials.gov. Leveraging natural language processing, descriptive analysis, association analysis, and clustering analysis, we characterized COVID-19 clinical studies by phase and design features. Particularly, we analyzed their eligibility criteria to understand: (1) whether they considered the reported underlying health conditions that may lead to severe illnesses, and (2) if these studies excluded older adults, either explicitly or implicitly, which may reduce the generalizability of these studies in older adults. Results: The 5 most frequently tested drugs are Hydroxychloroquine (N=148), Azithromycin (N=46), Tocilizumab (N=29), Lopinavir (N=20), and Ritonavir (N=20). Most trials did not have an upper age limit and did not exclude patients with common chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes that are prevalent in older adults. However, known risk factors that may lead to severe illnesses have not been adequately considered by existing studies. Conclusions: A careful examination of the registered COVID-19 clinical studies can identify the research gaps and inform future COVID-19 trial design towards balanced internal validity and generalizability.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

344,CLINICALLY DISTINCT COVID-19 CASES SHARE STRIKINGLY SIMILAR IMMUNE RESPONSE PROGRESSION: A FOLLOW-UP ANALYSIS,"Inflammatory responses to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, range from asymptomatic to severe. Here we present a follow-up analysis of a longitudinal study characterizing COVID-19 immune responses from a father and son with distinctly different clinical courses. The father required a lengthy hospital stay for severe symptoms, whereas his son had mild symptoms and no fever yet tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 29 days. Father and son, as well as another unrelated COVID-19 patient, displayed a robust increase of SERPING1, the transcript encoding C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). We further bolstered this finding by incorporating a serum proteomics dataset and found that serum C1-INH was consistently increased in COVID-19 patients. C1-INH is a central regulator of the contact and complement systems, potentially linking COVID-19 to complement hyperactivation, fibrin clot formation, and immune depression. Furthermore, despite distinct clinical cases, significant parallels were observed in transcripts involved interferon and B cell signaling. As symptoms were resolving, widespread decreases were seen in immune-related transcripts to levels below those of healthy controls. Our study provides insight into the immune responses of likely millions of people with extremely mild symptoms who may not be aware of their infection with SARS-CoV-2 and implies a potential for long-lasting consequences that could contribute to reinfection risk.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

345,The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Libya during the ongoing-armed conflict.,"Abstract Introduction: COVID-19 can have even more dire consequences in countries with ongoing armed conflict. Libya, the second largest African country, has been involved in a major conflict since 2011. This study analyzed the epidemiological situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya, examined the impact of the armed conflict in Libya on the spread of the pandemic, and proposes strategies for dealing with the pandemic during this conflict. Methods: We collected the available information on all COVID-19 cases in the different regions of Libya, covering the period from March 25 to May 25, 2020. The cumulative number of cases and the daily new cases are presented in a way to illustrate the patterns and trends of COVID-19 and the effect of the ongoing armed conflict was assessed regionally. Results: A total of 698 cases of COVID-19 were reported in Libya during a period of three months. The number of cases varied from one region to another and was affected by the fighting. The largest number of cases was reported in the southern part of the country, which has been severely affected by the conflict in comparison to the eastern and western parts of the country. Conclusion: This study describes the epidemiological pattern of COVID-19 in Libya and how it has been affected by the ongoing armed conflict. This conflict seems to have hindered access to populations and thereby masked the true dimensions of the pandemic. Hence, efforts should be combined to combat these consequences.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

By investigating 47 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 16 uninfected controls, we found an immunometabolic dysregulation specific for patients with progressed disease that was reversible in the recovery phase. Specifically, T cells and monocytes exhibited increased mitochondrial mass, accumulated intracellular ROS and these changes were accompanied by disrupted mitochondrial architecture. Basigin (CD147), but not established markers of T cell activation, was up-regulated on T cells from progressed COVID-19 patients and correlated with ROS accumulation, reflected in the transcriptome. During recovery, basigin and ROS decreased to match the uninfected controls. In vitro analyses confirmed the correlation and showed a down-regulation of ROS by dexamethasone treatment. Our findings provide evidence of a basigin-related and reversible immunometabolic dysregulation in COVID-19.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

347,IMPACT OF UNIVERSITY RE-OPENING ON TOTAL COMMUNITY COVID-19 BURDEN,"Purpose: Post-secondary students have higher than average contacts than the general population due to congregate living, use of public transit, high-density academic and social activities, and employment in the services sector. We evaluated the impact of a large student population returning to a mid-sized city currently experiencing a low rate of COVID-19 on community health outcomes. We consider whether targeted routine or one-time screening in this population can mitigate community COVID-19 impacts. Methods: We developed a dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 subdivided into three interacting populations: general population, university students, and long-term care residents. We parameterized the model using the medical literature and expert opinion. We calibrated the model to the observed outcomes in a mid-sized Canadian city between March 1 and August 15, 2020 prior to the arrival of a relatively large post-secondary student population. We evaluated the impact of the student population (20,000 people arriving on September 1) on cumulative COVID-19 infections over the fall semester, the timing of peak infections, the timing and peak level of critical care occupancy, and the timing of re-engaged social and economic restrictions. We consider multiple scenarios with different student and general population COVID-19 prevention behaviours as well as different COVID-19 screening strategies in students. Results: In a city with low levels of COVID-19 activity, the return of a relatively large student population substantially increases the total number of COVID-19 infections in the community. In a scenario in which students immediately engage in a 24% contact reduction compared to pre-COVID levels, the total number of infections in the community increases by 87% (from 3,900 without the students to 7,299 infections with the students), with 71% of the incremental infections occurring in the general population, causing social and economic restrictions to be re-engaged 3 weeks earlier and an incremental 17 COVID-19 deaths. Scenarios in which students have an initial, short-term increase in contacts with other students before engaging in contact reduction behaviours can increase infections in the community by 150% or more. In such scenarios, screening asymptomatic students every 5 days reduces the number of infections attributable to the introduction of the university student population by 42% and delays the re-engagement of social and economic restrictions by 1 week. Compared to screening every 5 days, one-time mass screening of students prevents fewer infections, but is highly efficient in terms of infections prevented per screening test performed. Discussion: University students are highly inter-connected with the city communities in which they live and go to school, and they have a higher number of contacts than the general population. High density living environments, enthusiasm for the new school year, and relatively high rates of asymptomatic presentation may decrease their self-protective behaviours and contribute to increased community transmission of COVID-19 affecting at-risk members of the city community. Screening targeted at this population provides significant public health benefits to the community through averted infections, critical care admissions, and COVID-19 deaths.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

348,"SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in Tbilisi, the capital city of country of Georgia","Background: Georgia timely implemented effective response measures, with testing, contact tracing and isolation being the main pillar of the national response, achieving the lowest cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the European region. Methods: We conducted a survey to estimate SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody seroprevalence among adult residents of capital city of Tbilisi (adult population: 859,328). Participants were recruited through respondent driven sampling during May 18-27, 2020. Blood specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using commercially available lateral flow immunoassay (COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech). Crude seroprevalence was weighted by population characteristics (age, sex, district of Tbilisi) and further adjusted for test accuracy. Results: Among 1,068 adults recruited 963 (90.2%) were between 18 and 64 years-old, 682 (63.9%) women. 176 (16.5%) reported symptoms indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring in previous three months. Nine persons tested positive for IgG: crude seroprevalence: 0.84%, (95% CI: 0.33%-1.59%), weighted seroprevalence: 0.94% (95% CI: 0.37%-1.95%), weighted and adjusted for test accuracy: 1.02% (95% CI: 0.38%-2.18%). The seroprevalence estimates translate into 7,200 to 8,800 infections among adult residents of Tbilisi, which is at least 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. Conclusions: Low seroprevalence confirms that Georgia successfully contained spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of pandemic. Findings also suggest that undocumented cases due to asymptomatic or very mild disease account for majority of infections. Given that asymptomatic persons can potentially spread the virus, test and isolate approach should be further expanded to control the epidemic.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

Objective: To determine the variation in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in school children across districts, schools, grades, and classes, and the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence with self-reported symptoms. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline measurements of a longitudinal cohort study (Ciao Corona) from June-July 2020. Setting: 55 randomly selected schools and classes stratified by district in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland (1.5 million inhabitants). Participants: Children, aged 6-16 years old, attending grades 1-2, 4-5 and 7-8. Exposure: Exposure to circulating SARS-CoV-2 between February and June 2020 including public lock-down and school closure (March 16-May 10, 2020). Main Outcomes and Measures: Variation in seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children across 12 cantonal districts, schools, and grades using a Luminex-based antibody test with four targets for each of IgG, IgA and IgM. Clustering of cases within classes. Analysis of associations of seropositivity and symptoms. Comparison of seroprevalence with a randomly selected adult population, based on Luminex-based IgG and IgA antibody test of Corona Immunitas. Results: In total, 55 schools and 2585 children were recruited (1337 girls, median age 11, age range 6-16 years). Overall seroprevalence was 2.8 % (95% CI 1.6-4.1%), ranging from 1.0% to 4.5% across districts. Seroprevalence was 3.8% (1.9-6.1%) in grades 1-2, 2.5% (1.1-4.2%) in grades 4-5, and 1.5% (0.5-3.0%) in grades 7-8. At least one case was present in 36/55 tested schools and in 43/128 classes with [&ge;]50% participation rate and [&ge;]5 children tested. 73% of children reported COVID-19 compatible symptoms since January 2020, but none were reported more frequently in seropositive compared to seronegative children. Seroprevalence of children was very similar to seroprevalence of randomly selected adults in the same region in June-July 2020, measured with the same Corona Immunitas test, combining IgG and IgA (3.1%, 95% CI 1.4-5.4%, versus 3.3%, 95% CI 1.4-5.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: Seroprevalence was inversely related to age and revealed a dark figure of around 90 when compared to 0.03% confirmed PCR+ cases in children in the same area by end of June.

Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with ventilation need and mortality. Design, setting and participants: We established a retrospective cohort of COVID-19 patients from Mass General Brigham hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and admission laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records of patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 before May 19th, 2020. Using patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH, derivation cohort), multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to construct the Ventilation in COVID Estimator (VICE) and Death in COVID Estimator (DICE) risk scores. Measurements: The primary outcomes were ventilation status and death. Results: The entire cohort included 1042 patients (median age, 64 years; 56.8% male). The derivation and validation cohorts for the risk scores included 578 and 464 patients, respectively. We found seven factors to be independently predictive for ventilation requirement (diabetes mellitus, dyspnea, alanine aminotransferase, troponin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase), and 10 factors to be predictors of in-hospital mortality (age, sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic statin use, albumin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, mean corpuscular volume, platelet count, and procalcitonin). Using these factors, we constructed the VICE and DICE risk scores, which performed with C-statistics of at least 0.8 in our cohorts. Importantly, the chronic use of a statin was associated with protection against death due to COVID-19. The VICE and DICE score calculators have been placed on an interactive website freely available to the public (https://covid-calculator.com/).

352,"Monocytes and macrophages, targets of SARS-CoV-2: the clue for Covid-19 immunoparalysis","To date, the Covid-19 pandemic affected more than 18 million individuals and caused more than 690, 000 deaths. Its clinical expression is pleiomorphic and severity is related to age and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. The pathophysiology of the disease relies on aberrant activation of immune system and lymphopenia that has been recognized as a prognosis marker. We wondered if the myeloid compartment was affected in Covid-19 and if monocytes and macrophages could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects monocytes and macrophages without any cytopathic effect. Infection was associated with the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-{beta}) and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by the upregulation of M2-type molecules. In addition, we found that in vitro macrophage polarization did not account for the permissivity to SARS-CoV-2, since M1-and M2-type macrophages were similarly infected. Finally, in a cohort of 76 Covid-19 patients ranging from mild to severe clinical expression, all circulating monocyte subsets were decreased, likely related to massive emigration into tissues. Monocytes from Covid-19 patients exhibited decreased expression of HLA-DR and increased expression of CD163, irrespective of the clinical status. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 drives circulating monocytes and macrophages inducing immunoparalysis of the host for the benefit of Covid-19 disease progression.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

The array is designed to measure immunoglobulin isotype and subtype levels in serum or plasma samples against each of the individual antigens printed on the array. We probed the COVAM with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) collected from 99 donors who recovered from a PCR+ confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results were analyzed using two computational approaches, a generalized linear model (glm) and Random Forest (RF) prediction model, to classify individual specimens as either Reactive or Non-Reactive against the SARS-CoV-2 antigens. A training set of 88 pre-COVID-19 specimens (PreCoV) collected in August 2019 and102 positive specimens from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 cases was used for these analyses. Results compared with an FDA emergency use authorized (EUA) SARS-CoV2 S1-based total Ig chemiluminescence immunoassay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total, CoV2T) and with a SARS-CoV-2 S1-S2 spike-based pseudovirus micro neutralization assay (SARS-CoV-2 reporter viral particle neutralization titration (RVPNT) showed high concordance between the 3 assays. Three CCP specimens that were negative by the VITROS CoV2T immunoassay were also negative by both COVAM and the RVPNT assay. Concordance between VITROS CoV2T and COVAM was 96%, VITROS CoV2T and RVPNT 93%, and RVPNT and COVAM 95%. The discordances were all weakly reactive samples near the cutoff threshold of the VITROS CoV2T immunoassay. The multiplex COVAM allows CCP to be grouped according to antibody reactivity patterns against 11 SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Unsupervised K-means analysis, via the gap statistics, as well as hierarchical clustering analysis revealed 3 main clusters with distinct reactivity intensities and patterns. These patterns were not recapitulated by adjusting the VITROS CoV2T or RVPNT assay thresholds. Plasma classified according to these reactivity patterns may be better associated with CCP treatment efficacy than antibody levels alone. The use of a SARS-CoV-2 antigen array may be useful to qualify CCP for administration as a treatment for acute COVID-19 and to interrogate vaccine immunogenicity and performance in preclinical and clinical studies to understand and recapitulate antibody responses associated with protection from infection and disease.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

354,A soluble ACE2 microbody protein fused to a single immunoglobulin Fc domain is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture,"Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report on an improved soluble ACE2, termed a ""microbody"" in which the ACE2 ectodomain is fused to Fc domain 3 of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. The protein is smaller than previously described ACE2-Ig Fc fusion proteins and contains an H345A mutation in the ACE2 catalytic active site that inactivates the enzyme without reducing its affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. The disulfide-bonded ACE2 microbody protein inhibited entry of lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped virus and live SARS-CoV-2 with a potency 10-fold higher than unmodified soluble ACE2 and was active after initial virus binding to the cell. The ACE2 microbody inhibited the entry of ACE2-specific {beta} coronaviruses and viruses with the high infectivity variant D614G spike. The ACE2 microbody may be a valuable therapeutic for COVID-19 that is active against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future coronaviruses that may arise.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

355,Identification of novel antiviral drug combinations in vitro and tracking their development,"Combination therapies have become a standard for the treatment for HIV and HCV infections. They are advantageous over monotherapies due to better efficacy and reduced toxicity, as well as the ability to prevent the development of resistant viral strains and to treat viral co-infections. Here, we identify several new synergistic combinations against emerging and re-emerging viral infections in vitro. We observed synergistic activity of nelfinavir with investigational drug EIDD-2801 and convalescent serum against SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. We also demonstrated synergistic activity of vemurafenib combination with emetine, homoharringtonine, gemcitabine, or obatoclax against echovirus 1 infection in human lung epithelial A549 cells. We also found that combinations of sofosbuvir with brequinar and niclosamide were synergistic against HCV infection in hepatocyte derived Huh-7.5 cells, whereas combinations of monensin with lamivudine and tenofovir were synergistic against HIV-1 infection in human cervical TZM-bl cells. Finally, we present an online resource that summarizes novel and known antiviral drug combinations and their developmental status.

356,Comparison of Rhesus and Cynomolgus macaques as an authentic model for COVID-19.,"A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been identified as the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Animal models, and in particular non-human primates, are essential to understand the pathogenesis of emerging diseases and to the safety and efficacy of novel vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract and causes pulmonary lesions in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, resembling the mild clinical cases of COVID-19 in humans. Immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were also similar in both species and equivalent to those reported in milder infections and convalescent human patients. Importantly, we have devised a new method for lung histopathology scoring that will provide a metric to enable clearer decision making for this key endpoint. In contrast to prior publications, in which rhesus are accepted to be the optimal study species, we provide convincing evidence that both macaque species authentically represent mild to moderate forms of COVID-19 observed in the majority of the human population and both species should be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel and repurposed interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Accessing cynomolgus macaques will greatly alleviate the pressures on current rhesus stocks.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

In this work, we experimentally interrogate thousands of ACE2 mutants to identify over one hundred human single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are likely to have altered recognition by the virus, and make the complementary discovery that ACE2 residues distant from the spike interface can have a strong influence upon the ACE2-spike interaction. These findings illuminate new links between ACE2 sequence and spike recognition, and will find wide-ranging utility in SARS-CoV-2 fundamental research, epidemiological analyses, and clinical trial design.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

358,"Topography, spike dynamics and nanomechanics of individual native SARS-CoV-2 virions","SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, displays a corona-shaped layer of spikes which play fundamental role in the infection process. Recent structural data suggest that the spikes possess orientational freedom and the ribonucleoproteins segregate into basketlike structures. How these structural features regulate the dynamic and mechanical behavior of the native virion, however, remain unknown. By imaging and mechanically manipulating individual, native SARS-CoV-2 virions with atomic force microscopy, here we show that their surface displays a dynamic brush owing to the flexibility and rapid motion of the spikes. The virions are highly compliant and able to recover from drastic mechanical perturbations. Their global structure is remarkably temperature resistant, but the virion surface becomes progressively denuded of spikes upon thermal exposure. Thus, both the infectivity and thermal sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 rely on the dynamics and the mechanics of the virus.

359,Structural and Functional Comparison of SARS-CoV-2-Spike Receptor Binding Domain Produced in Pichia pastoris and Mammalian Cells,"The yeast Pichia pastoris is a cost-effective and easily scalable system for recombinant protein production. In this work we compared the conformation of the receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expressed in P. pastoris and in the well established HEK-293T mammalian cell system. RBD obtained from both yeast and mammalian cells was properly folded, as indicated by UV-absorption, circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence. They also had similar stability, as indicated by temperature-induced unfolding (observed Tm were 50 {degrees}C and 52 {degrees}C for RBD produced in P. pastoris and HEK-293T cells, respectively). Moreover, the stability of both variants was similarly reduced when the ionic strength was increased, in agreement with a computational analysis predicting that a set of ionic interactions may stabilize RBD structure. Further characterization by HPLC, size-exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed a higher heterogeneity of RBD expressed in P. pastoris relative to that produced in HEK-293T cells, which disappeared after enzymatic removal of glycans. The production of RBD in P. pastoris was scaled-up in a bioreactor, with yields above 45 mg/L of 90% pure protein, thus potentially allowing large scale immunizations to produce neutralizing antibodies, as well as the large scale production of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.",- Argentinian AntiCovid Consortium; Claudia R.

Here we present FD-seq, a high-throughput method for droplet-based RNA sequencing of paraformaldehyde-fixed, stained and sorted single-cells. We used FD-seq to address two important questions in virology. First, by analyzing a rare population of cells supporting lytic reactivation of the human tumor virus KSHV, we identified TMEM119 as a host factor that mediates reactivation. Second, we studied the transcriptome of lung cells infected with the coronavirus OC43, which causes the common cold and also serves as a safer model pathogen for SARS-CoV-2. We found that pro-inflammatory pathways are primarily upregulated in abortively-infected or uninfected bystander cells, which are exposed to the virus but fail to express high level of viral genes. FD-seq is suitable for characterizing rare cell populations of interest, for studying high-containment biological samples after inactivation, and for integrating intracellular phenotypic with transcriptomic information.",Daniel Martin Simadibrata; Julius Calvin; Alya Darin Wijaya; Naufal Arkan Abiyyu Ibrahim; Elin Rosenbek Severinsen; Kathrine Vauvert Roemmelmayer Hviid,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.302232""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.17.302232,2020-09-17,2020-09-17,,False
361,Mutational signatures in countries affected by SARS-CoV-2: Implications in host-pathogen interactome,"We are in the midst of the third severe coronavirus outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 with unprecedented health and socio-economic consequences due to the COVID-19. Globally, the major thrust of scientific efforts has shifted to the design of potent vaccine and anti-viral candidates. Earlier genome analyses have shown global dominance of some mutations purportedly indicative of similar infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. Using high-quality large dataset of 25k whole-genome sequences, we show emergence of new cluster of mutations as result of geographic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in local population ([&ge;]10%) of different nations. Using statistical analysis, we observe that these mutations have either significantly co-occurred in globally dominant strains or have shown mutual exclusivity in other cases. These mutations potentially modulate structural stability of proteins, some of which forms part of SARS-CoV-2-human interactome. The high confidence druggable host proteins are also up-regulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mutations occurring in potential hot-spot regions within likely T-cell and B-cell epitopes or in proteins as part of host-viral interactome, could hamper vaccine or drug efficacy in local population. Overall, our study provides comprehensive view of emerging geo-clonal mutations which would aid researchers to understand and develop effective countermeasures in the current crisis.

SignificanceOur comparative analysis of globally dominant mutations and region-specific mutations in 25k SARS-CoV-2 genomes elucidates its geo-clonal evolution. We observe locally dominant mutations (co-occurring or mutually exclusive) in nations with contrasting COVID-19 mortalities per million of population) besides globally dominant ones namely, P314L (ORF1b) and D164G (S) type. We also see exclusive dominant mutations such as in Brazil (I33T in ORF6 and I292T in N protein), England (G251V in ORF3a), India (T2016K and L3606F in ORF1a) and in Spain (L84S in ORF8).

362,The flexibility of ACE2 in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The COVID-19 pandemic has swept over the world in the past months, causing significant loss of life and consequences to human health. Although numerous drug and vaccine developments efforts are underway, many questions remain outstanding on the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral association to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its main host receptor, and entry in the cell. Structural and biophysical studies indicate some degree of flexibility in the viral extracellular Spike glycoprotein and at the receptor binding domain-receptor interface, suggesting a role in infection. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated, full-length membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, in both an apo and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) bound state, in order to probe the intrinsic dynamics of the ACE2 receptor in the context of the cell surface. A large degree of fluctuation in the full length structure is observed, indicating hinge bending motions at the linker region connecting the head to the transmembrane helix, while still not disrupting the ACE2 homodimer or ACE2-RBD interfaces. This flexibility translates into an ensemble of ACE2 homodimer conformations that could sterically accommodate binding of the spike trimer to more than one ACE2 homodimer, and suggests a mechanical contribution of the host receptor towards the large spike conformational changes required for cell fusion. This work presents further structural and functional insights into the role of ACE2 in viral infection that can be exploited for the rational design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

Statement of SignificanceAs the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 has been the subject of extensive structural and antibody design efforts in aims to curtail COVID-19 spread. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the homodimer ACE2 full-length structure to study the dynamics of this protein in the context of the cellular membrane. The simulations evidence exceptional plasticity in the protein structure due to flexible hinge motions in the head-transmembrane domain linker region and helix mobility in the membrane, resulting in a varied ensemble of conformations distinct from the experimental structures.

363,Mouse model for testing SARS-CoV-2 antivirals: Pharmacokinetics,"Background and ObjectivesRemdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are or were among the most promising therapeutic options to tackle the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Besides the use of the prodrug remdesivir itself, the direct administration of GS-441 524, the resulting main metabolite of remdesivir, could be advantageous and even more effective. All substances were not originally developed for the treatment of COVID-19 and especially for GS-441 524 little is known about its pharmacokinetic and physical-chemical properties. To justify the application of new or repurposed drugs in humans, pre-clinical in vivo animal models are mandatory to investigate relevant PK and PD properties and their relationship to each other. In this study, an adapted mouse model was chosen to demonstrate its suitability to provide sufficient information on the model substances GS-441 524 and HCQ regarding plasma concentration and distribution into relevant tissues a prerequisite for treatment effectiveness.

MethodsGS-441 524 and HCQ were administered intravenously as a single injection to male mice. Blood and organ samples were taken at several time points and drug concentrations were quantified in plasma and tissue homogenates by two liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the degradation of remdesivir in human plasma and blood. All pharmacokinetic analyses were performed with R Studio using non-compartmental analysis.

ResultsHigh tissue to plasma ratios for GS-441 524 and HCQ were found, indicating a significant distribution into the examined tissue, except for the central nervous system and fat. For GS-441 524, measured tissue concentrations exceeded the reported in vitro EC50 values by more than 10-fold and in consideration of its high efficacy against feline infectious peritonitis, GS-441 524 could indeed be effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. For HCQ, relatively high in vitro EC50 values are reported, which were not reached in all tissues. Facing its slow tissue distribution, HCQ might not lead to sufficient tissue saturation for a reliable antiviral effect.

ConclusionThe mouse model was able to characterise the PK and tissue distribution of both model substances and is a suitable tool to investigate early drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

364,Characterisation of protease activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection identifies novel viral cleavage sites and cellular targets for drug repurposing,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent behind the COVID-19 pandemic, and responsible for tens of millions of infections, and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Efforts to test, treat and vaccinate against this pathogen all benefit from an improved understanding of the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2. Both viral and cellular proteases play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and inhibitors targeting proteases have already shown success at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models. Here, we study proteolytic cleavage of viral and cellular proteins in two cell line models of SARS-CoV-2 replication using mass spectrometry to identify protein neo-N-termini generated through protease activity. We identify multiple previously unknown cleavage sites in multiple viral proteins, including major antigenic proteins S and N, which are the main targets for vaccine and antibody testing efforts. We discovered significant increases in cellular cleavage events consistent with cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and identify 14 potential high-confidence substrates of the main and papain-like proteases. We showed that siRNA depletion of these cellular proteins inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that drugs targeting two of these proteins: the tyrosine kinase SRC and Ser/Thr kinase MYLK, showed a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titres.

365,Efficient production of Moloney murine leukemia virus-like particles pseudotyped with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak that started in China at the end of 2019 has rapidly spread to become pandemic. Several investigational vaccines that have already been tested in animals and humans were able to induce neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, however protection and long-term efficacy in humans remain to be demonstrated.

We have investigated if a virus-like particle (VLP) derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) could be engineered to become a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine amenable to mass production. First, we showed that a codon optimized version of the S protein could migrate efficiently to the cell membrane. However, efficient production of infectious viral particles was only achieved with stable expression of a shorter version of S in its C-terminal domain ({Delta}S) in 293 cells that express MLV Gag-Pol (293GP). The incorporation of {Delta}S was 15-times more efficient into VLPs as compared to the full-length version, and that was not due to steric interference between the S cytoplasmic tail and the MLV capsid. Indeed, a similar result was also observed with extracellular vesicles released from parental 293 and 293GP cells. The amount of {Delta}S incorporated into VLPs released from producer cells was robust, with an estimated 1.25 g/ml S2 equivalent (S is comprised of S1 and S2). Thus, a scalable platform that has the potential for production of pan-coronavirus VLP vaccines has been established. The resulting nanoparticles could potentially be used alone or as a boost for other immunization strategies for COVID-19.

IMPORTANCESeveral candidate COVID-19 vaccines have already been tested in humans, but their protective effect and long-term efficacy are uncertain. Therefore, it is necessary to continue developing new vaccine strategies that could be more potent and/or that would be easier to manufacture in large-scale. Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are considered highly immunogenic and have been successfully developed for human papilloma virus as well as hepatitis and influenza viruses. In this study, we report the generation of a robust Moloney murine leukemia virus platform that produces VLPs containing the spike of SARS-CoV-2.

367,Baricitinib treatment resolves lower airway inflammation and neutrophil recruitment in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques,"Effective therapeutics aimed at mitigating COVID-19 symptoms are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 induced hypercytokinemia and systemic inflammation are associated with disease severity. Baricitinib, a clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory properties is currently being investigated in COVID-19 human clinical trials. Recent reports suggest that baricitinib may also have antiviral activity in limiting viral endocytosis. Here, we investigated the immunologic and virologic efficacy of baricitinib in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral shedding measured from nasal and throat swabs, bronchoalveolar lavages and tissues was not reduced with baricitinib. Type I IFN antiviral responses and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses remained similar between the two groups. Importantly, however, animals treated with baricitinib showed reduced immune activation, decreased infiltration of neutrophils into the lung, reduced NETosis activity, and more limited lung pathology. Moreover, baricitinib treated animals had a rapid and remarkably potent suppression of alveolar macrophage derived production of cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation and neutrophil recruitment.

368,Bromelain Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection in VeroE6 Cells,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The initial interaction between Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) primed SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is a pre-requisite step for this novel coronavirus pathogenesis. Here, we expressed a GFP-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S-Ectodomain in Tni insect cells. That contained sialic acid-enriched N- and O-glycans. Surface resonance plasmon (SPR) and Luminex assay showed that the purified S-Ectodomain binding to human ACE-2 and immunoreactivity with COVID-19 positive samples. We demonstrate that bromelain (isolated from pineapple stem and used as a dietary supplement) treatment diminishes the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 in VeroE6 cells and dramatically lowers the expression of S-Ectodomain. Importantly, bromelain treatment reduced the interaction between S-Ectodomain and VeroE6 cells. Most importantly, bromelain treatment significantly diminished the SARS-CoV-2 infection in VeroE6 cells. Altogether, our results suggest that bromelain or bromelain rich pineapple stem may be used as an antiviral against COVID-19.

369,Evaluation of nafamostat mesylate safety and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication using a 3-dimensional human airway epithelia model,"In the current COVID-19 pandemic context, Ensysce and its subsidiary Covistat have been working to repurpose nafamostat mesylate as an effective oral and inhalation treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prior reports used cell lines to demonstrate the antiviral potential of nafamostat against coronaviral infections and determined its mechanism of action through inhibition of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). We selected a biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental model of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection using a 3D human reconstituted airway epithelial model of nasal origin to characterize the effects of nafamostat on tissue-level cellular ultrastructure and viral infection kinetics. Our results confirm the not only the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of antiviral candidates, but also the highly potent nature of nafamostat SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity. The studies described herein provided evidence demonstrating the therapeutic potential of nafamostat against COVID-19, as well as its safety upon exposure to lung airway cellular.

370,"Ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin are non-specific promiscuous SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors","There is an urgent need for vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Encouraging progress has been made in developing antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Among the drug targets being investigated, the viral main protease (Mpro) is one of the most extensively studied drug targets. Mpro is a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the viral polyprotein at more than 11 sites and it is highly conserved among coronaviruses. In addition, Mpro has a unique substrate preference for glutamine in the P1 position. Taken together, it appears that Mpro inhibitors can achieve both broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a high selectivity index. Structurally diverse compounds have been reported as Mpro inhibitors, with several of which also showed antiviral activity in cell culture. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of six previously reported Mpro inhibitors, ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 using a consortium of techniques including FRET-based enzymatic assay, thermal shift assay, native mass spectrometry, cellular antiviral assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. Collectively, the results showed that the inhibition of Mpro by these six compounds is non-specific and the inhibition is abolished or greatly reduced with the addition of reducing reagent DTT. In the absence of DTT, these six compounds not only inhibit Mpro, but also a panel of viral cysteine proteases including SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, the 2Apro and 3Cpro from enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and EV-D68. However, none of the compounds inhibits the viral replication of EV-A71 or EV-D68, suggesting that the enzymatic inhibition potency IC50 values obtained in the absence of DTT cannot be used to faithfully predict their cellular antiviral activity. Overall, we provide compelling evidence suggesting that ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 are non-specific SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, and urge the scientific community to be stringent with hit validation.

Lopinavir was identified as an inhibitor of the HIV protease, and a lopinavir-ritonavir combination therapy was reported to be beneficial for the treatment of SARS and MERS. However, recent clinical tests could not prove that lopinavir-ritonavir therapy was an effective treatment for COVID-19. In this report, we examined the effect of lopinavir and ritonavir to the activity of the purified main protease (Mpro) protein of SARS- CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. Unexpectedly, lopinavir and ritonavir did not inhibit Mpro activity.

372,Positive selection within the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviruses independent of impact on protein function,"BackgroundThe emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) associated with severe acute respiratory disease (COVID-19) has prompted efforts to understand the genetic basis for its unique characteristics and its jump from non-primate hosts to humans. Tests for positive selection can identify apparently nonrandom patterns of mutation accumulation within genomes, highlighting regions where molecular function may have changed during the origin of a species. Several recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have identified signals of conservation and positive selection within the gene encoding Spike protein based on the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitution. Such tests cannot, however, detect changes in the function of RNA molecules.

MethodsHere we apply a test for branch-specific oversubstitution of mutations within narrow windows of the genome without reference to the genetic code.

ResultsWe recapitulate the finding that the gene encoding Spike protein has been a target of both purifying and positive selection. In addition, we find other likely targets of positive selection within the genome of SARS-CoV-2, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16. Homology-directed modeling indicates no change in either Nsp4 or Nsp16 protein structure relative to the most recent common ancestor. Thermodynamic modeling of RNA stability and structure, however, indicates that RNA secondary structure within both genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome differs from those of RaTG13, the reconstructed common ancestor, and Pan-CoV-GD (Guangdong). These SARS-CoV-2-specific mutations may affect molecular processes mediated by the positive or negative RNA molecules, including transcription, translation, RNA stability, and evasion of the host innate immune system. Our results highlight the importance of considering mutations in viral genomes not only from the perspective of their impact on protein structure, but also how they may impact other molecular processes critical to the viral life cycle.",Daniel Martin Simadibrata; Julius Calvin; Alya Darin Wijaya,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.300038""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.16.300038,2020-09-16,2020-09-16,,False
373,SARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp1 alters actomyosin cytoskeleton and phenocopies arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy-related PKP2 mutant,"Mutations in desmosomal Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) are the most prevalent drivers of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) and a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. However, partner proteins that elucidate PKP2 cellular mechanism to understand cardiac dysfunction in ACM are mostly unknown. Here we identify the actin-based motor proteins Myh9 and Myh10 as key PKP2 interactors, and demonstrate that the expression of the ACM-related PKP2 mutant R735X alters actin fiber organization and cell mechanical stiffness. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein acts similarly to this known pathogenic R735X mutant, altering the actomyosin component distribution on cardiac cells. Our data reveal that the viral Nsp1 hijacks PKP2 into the cytoplasm and mimics the effect of delocalized R735X mutant. These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic PKP2, wildtype or mutant, induces the collapse of the actomyosin network, since shRNA-PKP2 knockdown maintains the cell structure, validating a critical role of PKP2 localization in the regulation of actomyosin architecture. The fact that Nsp1 and PKP2 mutant R735X share similar phenotypes also suggests that direct SARS-CoV-2 heart infection could induce a transient ACM-like disease in COVID-19 patients, which may contribute to right ventricle dysfunction, observed in patients with poor survival prognosis.

HighlightsThe specific cardiac isoform Plakophilin-2a (PKP2) interacts with Myh9 and Myh10.

PKP2 delocalization alters actomyosin cytoskeleton component organization. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein hijacks PKP2 from the desmosome into the soluble fraction where it is downregulated.

374,The impact of COVID-19 in diabetic kidney disease and chronic kidney disease: A population-based study,"Background: The spectrum of pre-existing renal disease is known as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with diabetic nephropathy in comparison to patients with chronic kidney disease. Methods: We used the Mexican Open Registry of COVID-19 patients 11 to analyze anonymized records of those who had symptoms related to COVID-19 to analyze the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, admission, intubation, Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality. Robust Poisson regression was used to relate sex and age to each of the six outcomes and find adjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios. Also, binomial regression models were performed for those outcomes that had significant results to generate probability plots to perform a fine analysis of the results obtained along age as a continuous variable. Results: The adjusted prevalence analysis revealed that that there was a a 87.9% excess probability of developing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with diabetic nephropathy, a 5% excess probability of being admitted, a 101.7% excess probability of intubation and a 20.8% excess probability of a fatal outcome due to COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison to CKD patients (p<0.01). Conclusions: Patients with diabetic nephropathy had nearly a twofold rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, a higher probability of admission, a twofold probability of intubation and a higher chance of death once admitted compared to patients with chronic kidney disease alone. Also, both diseases had higher COVID-19 pneumonia rates, intubation rates and case-fatality rates compared to the overall population.

375,Nowcasting CoVID-19 Deaths in England by Age and Region,"Understanding the trajectory of the daily numbers of deaths in people with CoVID-19 is essential to decisions on the response to the CoVID-19 pandemic. Estimating this trajectory from data on numbers of deaths is complicated by the delay between deaths occurring and their being reported to the authorities. In England, Public Health England receives death reports from a number of sources and the reporting delay is typically several days, but can be several weeks. Delayed reporting results in considerable uncertainty about the number of deaths that occurred on the most recent days. In this article, we estimate the number of deaths per day in each of five age strata within seven English regions. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model that involves a submodel for the number of deaths per day and a submodel for the reporting delay distribution. This model accounts for reporting-day effects and longer-term changes over time in the delay distribution. We show how the model can be fitted in a computationally efficient way when the delay distribution is same in multiple strata, e.g. over a wide range of ages.",Daniel Martin Simadibrata; Julius Calvin; Alya Darin Wijaya; Naufal Arkan Abiyyu Ibrahim,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194209""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194209,2020-09-16,2020-09-16,,True
376,Variation across population subgroups of COVID-19 antibody testing performance,"Understanding variations in the performance of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 across varying demographics is relevant to clinical interpretations and public policy derived from their results. Appropriate use of serological assays to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies requires estimation of their accuracy over large populations and an understanding of the variance in performance over time and across demographic groups. In this manuscript we focus on anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody tests approved under emergency use authorizations and determine the recall of the serological tests compared to RT-PCR tests by Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINCs). Variability in test performance was further examined over time and by demographics. The recall of the most common IgG assay (LOINC 94563-4) was 91.2% (95% CI: 90.5%, 91.9%). IgA (LOINC 94562-6) and IgM (94564-2) assays performed significantly worse than IgG assays with estimated recall rates of 20.6% and 27.3%, respectively. A statistically significant difference in recall (p = 0.019) was observed across sex with a higher recall in males than females, 92.1% and 90.4%, respectively. Recall also differed significantly by age group, with higher recall in those over 45 compared to those under 45, 92.9% and 88.0%, respectively (p < 0.001). While race was unavailable for the majority of the individuals, a significant difference was observed between recall in White individuals and Black individuals (p = 0.007) and White individuals and Hispanic individuals (p=0.001).

Inhibiting this interaction is a main approach to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and it is required to have high affinity to RBD independently of viral mutation for effective protection. To this end, we engineered ACE2 to enhance the affinity with directed evolution in human cells. Three cycles of random mutation and cell sorting achieved more than 100-fold higher affinity to RBD than wild-type ACE2. The extracellular domain of modified ACE2 fused to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1 had stable structure and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic virus with more than 100-fold lower concentration than wild-type.

378,"Safety and Efficacy of the combined use of ivermectin, dexamethasone, enoxaparin and aspirin against COVID-19","From the first outbreak in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, until today the number of deaths worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic exceeds eight hundred thousand people and the number of infected people arises to more than 25 million. No treatment tested worldwide has shown unquestionable efficacy in the fight against COVID 19, according to NICE reports. We have designed an experimental treatment called IDEA based on four affordable drugs already available on the market in Argentina, based on the following rationale: -Ivermectin solution at a relatively high dose to lower the viral load in all stages of COVID 19 -Dexamethasone 4-mg injection, as anti-inflammatory drug to treat hyperinflammatory reaction to COVID-infection -Enoxaparin injection as anticoagulant to treat hypercoagulation in severe cases. -Aspirin 250-mg tablets to prevent hypercoagulation in mild and moderate cases Except for Ivermection oral solution, which was used in a higher dose than approved for parasitosis, all other drugs were used in the already approved dose and indication. Regarding Ivermectin safety, several oral studies have shown it to be safe even when used at daily doses much higher than those approved already. A clinical study has been conducted on COVID-19 patients at Eurnekian Hospital in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The study protocol and its final outcomes are described in this article. Results were compared with published data and data from patients admitted to the hospital receiving other treatments. None of the patient presenting mild symptoms needed to be hospitalized. Only one patient died (0.59 % of all included patients vs. 2.1 % overall mortality for the disease in Argentina today; 3.1 % of hospitalized patients vs. 26.8 % mortality in published data).

We have conducted this study to identify the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in cancer patients with COVID-19 and have explored the relationship of various clinical factors to mortality in our patient cohort. Methods: All active cancer cases presented to the hospital from 8th June to 24 August 2020, and developed symptoms/ radiological features suspicious of COVID-19 were tested by Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and/or cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test from a combination of naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical data, treatment details, and outcomes were assessed from the medical records. Results: Of the total 3101 cancer patients admitted to the hospital, 1088 patients were tested and 186 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The CFR in the cohort was 27/186 (14.5%). Univariate analysis showed that the risk of death was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities [OR: 2.68; (95%CI: 1.13-6.32); P=0.02], multiple comorbidities [OR: 3.01; (95%CI: 1.02-9.07); P=0.046 for multiple vs. single], and the severity of COVID-19 presentation [OR: 27.48; (95%CI: 5.34-141.49); P=0.0001 for severe vs. not severe]. Among all comorbidities, diabetes [OR: 3.3; (95%CI: 1.35-8.09); P=0.008] and cardiovascular diseases [OR: 3.77; (95%CI: 1.02-13.91); P=0.045] were significant risk factors for death. The receipt of anticancer treatments including chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy within a month before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms had no significant effect on the mortality of cancer patients. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study from India reporting the CFR, clinical associations, and risk factors for mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients. Our study shows that the frequency of COVID-19 in cancer patients is high, and the CFR is 7.6 times more than the national average. Anticancer therapies did not increase the risk of death.

Risk factors include pre-existing conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. There are currently no effective treatments. Our objective was to complete a meta-analysis to identify comorbidity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational approach. Results SNP datasets were downloaded from publicly available GWAS catalog for 141 of 258 candidate COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant pathways by using MAGMA program. SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMA-identified genes. COVID-19 comorbidities from six disease categories were found to have significant associated pathways, which were validated by Q-Q plots (p<0.05). The top 250 human mRNA gene expressions for SNP-affected pathways, extracted from publicly accessible gene expression profiles, were evaluated for significant pathways. Protein-protein interactions of identified differentially expressed genes, visualized with STRING program, were significant (p<0.05). Gene interaction networks were found to be relevant to SARS and influenza pathogenesis. Conclusion Pathways potentially affected by or affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified in underlying medical conditions likely to confer susceptibility and/or severity to COVID-19.

Low birth weight (LBW) alters cardiovascular and lung development and predisposes to adult disease. We hypothesized that LBW is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in non-elderly subjects. We analyzed a prospective cohort of 397 patients (18-70y) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection attended in a tertiary hospital, where 15% required admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Perinatal and current potentially predictive variables were obtained from all patients and LBW was defined as birth weight [&le;]2,500 g. Age (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.04 [1-1.07], P=0.012), male sex (aOR 3.39 [1.72-6.67], P<0.001), hypertension (aOR 3.37 [1.69-6.72], P=0.001), and LBW (aOR 3.61 [1.55-8.43], P=0.003) independently predicted admission to ICU.

382,A Comparative Study to Find a Suitable Model for an Improved Real-Time Monitoring of The Interventions to Contain COVID-19 Outbreak in The High Incidence States of India,"Background On March 11, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a global pandemic. There emerged a need for reliable models to estimate the imminent incidence and overall assessment of the outbreak, in order to develop effective interventions and control strategies. One such vital metrics for monitoring the transmission trends over time is the time-dependent effective reproduction number (Rt). Rt is an estimate of secondary cases caused by an infected individual at a time during the outbreak, given that a certain population proportion is already infected. Misestimated Rt is particularly concerning when probing the association between the changes in transmission rate and the changes in the implemented policies. In this paper, we substantiate the implementation of the instantaneous reproduction number (Rins) method over the conventional method to estimate Rt viz case reproduction number (Rcase), by unmasking the real-time estimation ability of both methodologies using credible datasets. Materials & Methods We employed the daily incidence dataset of COVID-19 for India and high incidence states to estimate Rins and Rcase. We compared the real-time projection obtained through these methods by corroborating those states that are containing a high number of COVID19 cases and are conducting high and efficient COVID-19 testing. The Rins and Rcase were estimated using R0 and EpiEstim packages respectively in R software 4.0.0. Results Although, both the Rins and Rcase for the selected states were higher during the lockdown phases (March 25 - June 1, 2020) and subsequently stabilizes co-equally during the unlock phase (June 1- August 23, 2020), Rins demonstrated variations in accordance with the interventions while Rcase remained generalized and under- & overestimated. A larger difference in Rins and Rcase estimates were also observed for states that are conducting high testing. Conclusion Of the two methods, Rins elucidated a better real-time progression of the COVID-19 outbreak conceptually and empirically, than that of Rcase. However, we also suggest considering the assumptions corroborated in the implementations which may result in misleading conclusions in the real world.",Daniel Martin Simadibrata; Julius Calvin; Alya Darin Wijaya,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20190447""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20190447,2020-09-15,2020-09-15,,True
383,Containment to outbreak tipping points in COVID-19,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been a cornerstone in managing emergent diseases such as COVID-191-4. However, despite their potential to contain or attenuate the epidemic, the effects of NPIs on disease dynamics are not well understood1,5-7. We show that saturation of NPIs with the increase in infected individuals, an expected consequence of limited contact tracing and healthcare capacities, produces a positive feedback in the disease growth rate and a threshold between two alternative states--containment and outbreak8. These alternative states were previously related with the strength of NPIs but not with the infection number2,9-11. Furthermore, the transition between these states involves an abrupt acceleration in disease dynamics, which we report here for several COVID-19 outbreaks around the world. The consequences of a positive feedback in population dynamics at low numbers is a phenomenon widely studied in ecology--the Allee effect. This effect is a determinant of extinction-outbreak states, geographic synchronization, spatial spread, and the effect of exogenous variables, as vaccination12-15. As countries are relaxing containing measures, recognizing an NPI-induced Allee effect may be essential for deploying containment strategies within and among countries16 and acknowledges the need for early warning indicators of approaching epidemic tipping points17.",Daniel Martin Simadibrata; Julius Calvin; Alya Darin Wijaya; Naufal Arkan Abiyyu Ibrahim; Elin Rosenbek Severinsen; Kathrine Vauvert Roemmelmayer Hviid; Astrid Marie Kolte,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194159""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194159,2020-09-15,2020-09-15,,True
384,Are we there yet? An adaptive SIR model for continuous estimation of COVID-19 infection rate and reproduction number in the United States,"The dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic vary due to local population density and policy measures. When making decisions, policy makers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number R_t which is the expected number of secondary infections by a single infected individual. We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and reproduction number R_t using a sliding window approach applied to a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model. The infection rate is estimated using the reported cases for a seven-day window to obtain continuous estimation of R_t. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model can quickly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and associated increase in the reported cases of infections. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be one of the effective methods of reducing R_t. The aSIR model was applied to data at the state and county levels.",Daniel Martin Simadibrata; Julius Calvin; Alya Darin Wijaya; Naufal Arkan Abiyyu Ibrahim,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193896""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193896,2020-09-15,2020-09-15,,True
385,Treatment with an Anti-CK2 Synthetic Peptide Improves Clinical Response in Covid-19 Patients with Pneumonia. A Randomized and Controlled Clinical Trial,"Background: The recently discovered instrumental role of CK2 in the SARS-Cov2 infection has pointed out this protein kinase as a promising therapeutic target in Covid-19 disease. Accordingly, anti-SARS-Cov2 activity has been reported by CK2 inhibitors in vitro, however any anti-CK2 clinical approach has been assessed in Covid-19 patients so far. Here, we investigated the putative clinical benefit of CIGB-325, an anti-CK2 peptide previously used in cancer patients, which was added to the standard-of-care to treat Covid-19. Methods: A monocentric, randomized standard-of-care controlled trial of intravenous CIGB-325 in adults hospitalized with Covid-19. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive CIGB-300 (2.5 mg/kg/day during 5-consecutive days) plus standard-of-care (10 patients) or standard-of-care (10 patients). Primary outcomes were time to viral clearance defined as the time (in days) to have nasopharyngeal SARS-Cov2 negative PCR and clinical response. This trial is registered with https://rpcec.sld.cu/trials/RPCEC00000317-En (Code: IG/CIGB300I/CV/2001). Results: Most of the patients had initial positive by chest-computed tomography (CT). CIGB-325 treatment reduced both number of pulmonary lesions and lesion's extent compared to control group in seven days. Taking into account the Covid-19 chest-CT abnormalities, CIGB-325 was also superior to control as well as in terms of proportion of patients with such clinical benefit. Improvement of clinical status was experienced in 50% of patients in the CIGB-325 group and 25% in control. Accordingly, systemic levels of CPK, LDH and CRP were lowered at day 7 by treating with this anti-CK2 peptide. Both therapeutic regimens were similar respect to SARS-Cov2 clearance in nasopharynx swabs over the time. Conclusion: Our study revealed that consecutive-5 day regimen of intravenous CIGB-325 at 2.5 mg/kg quickly improved the chest-CT outcomes over standard-of-care.

386,Words Matter: Political and gender analysis of speeches made by heads of government during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on political leadership and decision-making around the world. Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. Methods: We analyzed the public statements and speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States, Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19 and pandemic response. We used a deductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language used and content discussed. Findings: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19 made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women leaders spoke more frequently about the impact on local or individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including addressing to: mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their citizen population. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe the COVID-19 virus and response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. Conclusion: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This language is important because it influences how leaders inspire citizens to adhere to the social contract, and the priorities they highlight and the words they use are meant to resonate with the rest of the nation.",Daniel Martin Simadibrata; Julius Calvin; Alya Darin Wijaya; Naufal Arkan Abiyyu Ibrahim,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20187427""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20187427,2020-09-15,2020-09-15,,True
387,Flushing of stagnant premise water systems after theCOVID-19 shutdown can reduce infection risk byLegionella and Mycobacterium spp.,"The unprecedented widespread closing of buildings due to the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed water to stagnate in premise plumbing systems, creating conditions that may facilitate the growth of opportunistic pathogens. In this study, we flushed and collected samples from showers in buildings that had been unoccupied for approximately two months and quantified Legionella pneumophila using a commercial cultivation-based assay. In addition, all bacteria, Legionella spp., L. pneumophila, L. pneumophila serogroup 1, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were analyzed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Despite low or negligible total chlorine in the stagnant pre-flush water samples, L. pneumophila were not detected by either method; Legionella spp., NTM, and MAC, however, were widespread. Using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), estimated risks of clinical illness from exposure to legionella and MAC via showering were generally low, but the risk of subclinical infection via Legionella spp. could exceed a 10-7 daily risk threshold if just a small fraction ([&ge;]0.1 %) of those legionellae detected by qPCR are highly infectious. Flushing cold and hot water lines rapidly restored a total chlorine (as chloramine) residual and decreased all bacterial gene targets to building inlet water levels within 30 min. Following flushing, the chlorine residual rapidly dissipated and bacterial gene targets rebounded, approaching pre-flush concentrations after 6 to 7 days of stagnation. These results suggest that stagnant water in premise plumbing may contain elevated levels of opportunistic pathogens; flushing, however, can rapidly improve water quality and reduce the health risk but the improvement will be short-lived if building disuse persists.",Daniel Martin Simadibrata; Julius Calvin; Alya Darin Wijaya; Naufal Arkan Abiyyu Ibrahim; Elin Rosenbek Severinsen; Kathrine Vauvert Roemmelmayer Hviid; Astrid Marie Kolte,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194407""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.20194407,2020-09-15,2020-09-15,,True
388,"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at delivery in women, partners and newborns","Background: Only few studies have focused on serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women and no previous study has investigated the frequency in partners. The aim was to investigate the frequency and impact of SARS-CoV-2 in parturient women, their partners and newborns. Methods: From April 4th to July 3rd, 2020, all parturient women, their partners and newborns were invited to participate in the study. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission and immediately after delivery a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history, obstetric- and neonatal information were available. Results: A total of 1,361 parturient women, 1,236 partners and 1,342 newborns participated in the study. No associations between previous COVID-19 disease and obstetric- or neonatal complications were found. The adjusted serological prevalence was 2.9% in women and 3.8% in partners. The frequency of blood type A was significantly higher in women with antibodies compared to women without antibodies. 17 newborns had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, and none had IgM antibodies. Full serological data from 1,052 families showed an absolute risk of infection of 0.37 if the partner had antibodies. Only 55% of individuals with antibodies reported symptoms.

389,Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on admission to predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients: a meta-analysis,"The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammatory marker, was suggested to be predictive of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, thus allowing early risk stratification. In this study, we investigated whether NLR levels on admission could predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. A literature search was conducted on 23 July 2020 to retrieve all published articles, including grey literature and preprints, investigating the association between on-admission NLR values and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI). Meta-regression analysis was done to identify potential confounders. A total of 38 articles, including 5699 patients with severity outcomes and 6033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95%CI 0.72-1.04; I2=75% and 1.68; 95%CI 0.98-2.39; I2=99%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.75 (95%CI 0.97-7.72). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between NLR levels on admission and COVID-19 severity and mortality was unaffected by age (p=0.236; p=0.213, respectively). High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality.

390,Mathematical Modelling of the Spread of the Coronavirus under Social Restrictions,"COVID-19 has affected most countries and declared as pandemic. Most countries have implemented some social restrictions to control it. In this work we will use mathematical modelling to assess the current social restrictions in controlling the spread of the disease. We formulate a simple susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model to describe the spread of the coronavirus under social restrictions. The transmission rate in this model is considered variable to catch social restrictions impact. We analyze this model, then fit the model to 160 days induced death data in Italy, Iran, USA, Germany, France, India, Spain and China. we estimate some factors that help in understanding not only the spread of the disease but also assess the current social restriction in controlling this disease. Results: We find a formula for the basic reproduction function (R(t)) and the maximum number of daily infected people. Then estimate the model's parameters with 95% confidence intervals in these countries. We notice that the model has excellent fit to the disease death data in all considered countries except Iran. The percentage of disease death estimated by the model in Germany and France are 3.8% and 1.2% respectively, which are close to reported percentages values. Finally, we estimate the time, after first reported death, spent under social restrictions to reduce the basic reproduction function (R(t)) to one unit. The times to do that in Italy, USA, Germany, France, Spain and China are 40, 50, 34,58, 31, and 15 days respectively. However, the Indian social restrictions in the 160 days were not enough to reach $R(t)=1$. The transmission rate is between 0.1035- 1.6076 and recovery rate is between 0-0.2456. The disease death rates calculated for Germany and France are more realistic than others with average value 0.0023. Extending the same social restrictions for enough time could control the disease in Italy, USA, Germany, France, India, Spain and China.

391,Characterization and Phase 1 Trial of a B Cell Activating Anti-CD73 Antibody for the Immunotherapy of COVID-19,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has resulted in over 800,000 deaths. Robust humoral anti-viral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of neutralizing antibodies to eliminate viruses and protect against re-infection, transmission, and the evolution of mutations that escape targeted therapeutics. CD73 is present on the majority of human B cells and a subset of T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into adenosine, which can be immunosuppressive. Here we report on CPI-006, a humanized Fc{gamma}R binding-deficient IgG1 anti-CD73 antibody that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and directly activates CD73+ B cells, inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of adenosine. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood from advanced cancer patients receiving CPI-006 revealed evidence of B cell activation, clonal expansion, and development of memory B cells. These immune effects suggested that CPI-006 may be effective at enhancing the magnitude, diversity, and duration of humoral and cellular responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We have therefore initiated a Phase 1, single-dose, dose-escalation trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients and to determine effects of CPI-006 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and the development of memory B cell and T cells. Ten patients have been enrolled in the trial receiving doses of 0.3 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. All evaluable patients had low pre-treatment serum levels of anti-viral antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its receptor binding domain, independent of the duration of their COVID-19 related symptoms prior to enrollment. Anti-viral antibody responses were induced 7 days after CPI-006 treatment and titers continued to rise past Day 56. Increases in the frequency of memory B cells and effector/memory T cells were observed 28 days after treatment. These preliminary results suggest that CPI-006 activates B cells and may enhance and prolong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19.

393,SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater settled solids is associated with COVID-19 cases in a large urban sewershed,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) may be useful for informing public health response to viral diseases like COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. We quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater influent and primary settled solids in two wastewater treatment plants to inform the pre-analytical and analytical approaches, and to assess whether influent or solids harbored more viral targets. The primary settled solids samples resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 detection frequencies than the corresponding influent samples. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more readily detected in solids using one-step digital droplet (dd)RT-PCR than with two-step RT-QPCR and two-step ddRT-PCR, likely owing to reduced inhibition with the one-step ddRT-PCR assay. We subsequently analyzed a longitudinal time series of 89 settled solids samples from a single plant for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as coronavirus recovery (bovine coronavirus) and fecal strength (pepper mild mottle virus, PMMoV) controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets N1 and N2 concentrations correlate positively and significantly with COVID-19 clinical confirmed case counts in the sewershed.

394,SARS-CoV-2 N-antigenemia: A new alternative to nucleic acid amplification techniques,"Background. Molecular assays on nasopharyngeal swabs remain the cornerstone of COVID-19 diagnostic. Despite massive worldwide efforts, the high technicalities of nasopharyngeal sampling and molecular assays, as well as scarce resources of reagents, limit our testing capabilities. Several strategies failed, to date, to fully alleviate this testing process (e.g. saliva sampling or antigen testing on nasopharyngeal samples). We assessed the performances of a new ELISA microplate assay quantifying SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) in serum or plasma. Methods. The specificity of the assay, determined on 63 non-COVID patients, was 98.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.3 to 100). Performances were determined on 227 serum samples from 165 patients with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection included in the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts. Findings. Sensitivity was 132/142, 93.0% (95% CI, 84.7 to 100), within the first two weeks after symptoms onset. A subset of 73 COVID-19 patients had a serum collected within 24 hours following or preceding a positive nasopharyngeal swab. Among patients with high nasopharyngeal viral loads, Ct value below 30 and 33, only 1/50 and 4/67 tested negative for N-antigenemia, respectively. Among patients with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, 8/12 presented positive N-antigenemia. The lower respiratory tract was explored for 6/8 patients, showing positive PCR in 5 cases. Interpretation. This is the first demonstration of the N-antigen antigenemia during COVID-19. Its detection presented a robust sensitivity, especially within the first 14 days after symptoms onset and high nasopharyngeal viral loads.

395,Predictors of characteristics associated with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test despite proven disease and association with treatment and outcomes.The COVID-19 RT-PCR Study.,"Background: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) testing is an important tool for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). However, performance concerns have recently emerged, especially about its sensitivity.. We hypothesized that clinical, biological and radiological characteristics of patients with false negative first RT-PCR testing, despite final diagnosis of COVID19, might differ from patients with positive first RT PCR. Methods: Case / control, multicenter study in which COVID19 patients with negative first RT PCR testing were matched to patients with positive first RT PCR on age, gender and initial admission unit (ward or intensive care). Results: Between March 30, and June 22, 2020, 80 cases and 80 controls were included. Neither proportion of death at hospital discharge, nor duration of hospital length stay differed between case and control patients (P=0.80 and P=0.54, respectively). In multivariate analysis, headache (adjusted OR: 0.07 [0.01 ; 0.49]; P=0.007) and fatigue/malaise (aOR: 0.16 [0.03 ; 0.81]; P=0.027) were associated with lower risk of false negative, whereas platelets > 207.103.mm-3 (aOR: 3.81 [1.10 ; 13.16]; P=0.034) and CRP > 79.8 mg.L-1 (aOR: 4.00 [1.21 ; 13.19]; P=0.023) were associated with higher risk of false negative.

We expanded SARS-CoV-2 T-cells from the peripheral blood of COVID-19-recovered donors and non-exposed controls using different culture conditions. We observed that the choice of cytokines modulates the expansion, phenotype and hierarchy of antigenic recognition by SARS-CoV-2 T-cells. Culture with IL-2/4/7 but not other cytokine-driven conditions resulted in >1000 fold expansion in SARS-CoV-2 T-cells with a retained phenotype, function and hierarchy of antigenic recognition when compared to baseline (pre-expansion) samples. Expanded CTLs were directed against structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the receptor-binding domain of Spike. SARS-CoV-2 T-cells could not be efficiently expanded from the peripheral blood of non-exposed controls.

397,Ceftazidime Is a Potential Drug to Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Infection In Vitro by Blocking Spike Protein-ACE2 Interaction,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads globally as a sever pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 mainly depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells. Therefore, repurposing of known drugs to inhibit S protein-ACE2 interaction could be a quick way to develop effective therapy for COVID-19. Using a high-throughput screening system to investigate the interaction between spike receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 extracellular domain, we screened 3581 FDA-approved drugs and natural small molecules and identified ceftazidime as a potent compound to inhibit S-RBD-ACE2 interaction by binding to S-RBD. In addition to significantly inhibit S-RBD binding to HPAEpiC cells, ceftazidime efficiently prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to infect ACE2-expressing 293T cells. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 113.2 M, which is far below the blood concentration (over 300 M) of ceftazidime in patients when clinically treated with recommended dose. Notably, ceftazidime is a drug clinically used for the treatment of pneumonia with minimal side effects compared with other antiviral drugs. Thus, ceftazidime has both anti-bacterial and anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, which should be the first-line antibiotics used for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu; Carlos Torruco-Sotelo; Felipe Jurado; Hector Serna-secundino; Cristina Aguilar; Jose Garcia-Olanzaran; Diana Hernandez-Garcia; Emma Jones; Michael Usher; Jeffrey Chipman,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.295956""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.295956,2020-09-15,2020-09-15,,False

There are few therapeutic options and no approved vaccines. Here we examine the properties of highly potent human monoclonal antibodies (hu-mAbs) in a mouse adapted model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2 MA). In vitro antibody neutralization potency did not uniformly correlate with in vivo activity, and some hu-mAbs were more potent in combination in vivo. Analysis of antibody Fc regions revealed that binding to activating Fc receptors is essential for optimal protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA.

399,"The Anti-histamine Azelastine, Identified by Computational Drug Repurposing, Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Reconstituted Human Nasal Tissue In Vitro","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is an enormous threat for healthcare systems and economies worldwide that urgently demands effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. Unlike the development of vaccines and new drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2, repurposing of approved or clinically tested drugs can provide an immediate solution.

MethodsWe applied a novel computational approach to search among approved and clinically tested drugs from the DrugBank database. Candidates were selected based on Shannon entropy homology and predefined activity profiles of three small molecules with proven anti-SARS-CoV activity and a published data set. Antiviral activity of a predicted drug, azelastine, was tested in vitro in SARS-CoV-2 infection assays with Vero E6 monkey kidney epithelial cells and reconstituted human nasal tissue. The effect on viral replication was assessed by quantification of viral genomes by droplet digital PCR.

FindingsThe computational approach with four independent queries identified major drug families, most often and in overlapping fashion anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-histamine and neuroactive drugs. Azelastine, an histamine 1 receptor-blocker, was predicted in multiple screens, and based on its attractive safety profile and availability in nasal formulation, was selected for experimental testing. Azelastine significantly reduced cytopathic effect and SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of [~]6 M both in a preventive and treatment setting. Furthermore, azelastine in a commercially available nasal spray tested at 5-fold dilution was highly potent in inhibiting viral propagation in SARS-CoV-2 infected reconstituted human nasal tissue.

InterpretationsAzelastine, an anti-histamine, available in nasal sprays developed against allergic rhinitis may be considered as a topical prevention or treatment of nasal colonization with SARS-CoV-2. As such, it could be useful in reducing viral spread and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Ultimately, its potential benefit should be proven in clinical studies.

The genomic signature deciphered during the ongoing pandemic period is valuable to understand the virus evolutionary patterns and spread across the globe. Increased availability of genome information of circulating strain in our country will enable to generate selective details in virulent and non virulent markers to prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions. The first case of SARS CoV-2 was detected in Chambal region of Madhya Pradesh state in mid of March 2020 followed by multiple introduction events and expansion of COVID-19 cases within 3 months in this region. We analyzed around 5000 COVID -19 suspected samples referred to Defence Research and Development Establishment, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. A total of 136 cases were found positive over a span of three months period this includes virus introduction to region and further spread. Whole genome sequences employing Oxford nanopore technology were deciphered for 26 SARS-CoV-2 circulating in 10 different districts in Madhya Pradesh State of India. The region witnessed index cases with multiple travel history responsible for introduction of COVID-19 followed by remarkable expansion of virus. The genome wide substitutions including in important viral proteins were observed. The detailed phylogenetic analysis revealed the circulating SARS-CoV-2 clustered in multiple clades A2a, A4 and B.

The analyses showed non-significant evolutionary divergences within and between the six countries, as well as a significant similarity to the time of genetic evolutionary divergence between all populations. Thus, it seems safe to affirm that we will find similar results for the other Countries of South America, reducing speculation about the existence of rapid and silent mutations that, although there are as we have shown in this work, do not increase, until this moment, the genetic variability of the Virus, a fact that would hinder the work with molecular targets for vaccines and drugs in general.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu; Carlos Torruco-Sotelo; Felipe Jurado; Hector Serna-secundino,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.296491""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.296491,2020-09-15,2020-09-15,,False
402,SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot: Improved secondary structure prediction and detection of inter-viral structural similarity,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the COVID-19 pandemic; a pandemic of a scale that has not been seen in the modern era. Despite over 29 million reported cases and over 900, 000 deaths worldwide as of September 2020, herd immunity and widespread vaccination efforts by many experts are expected to be insufficient in addressing this crisis for the foreseeable future. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatments that can lessen the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in patients who become seriously affected. Many viruses including HIV, the common cold, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use a unique mechanism known as -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to successfully replicate and infect cells in the human host. SARS-CoV (the coronavirus responsible for SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 possess a unique RNA structure, a three-stemmed pseudoknot, that stimulates -1 PRF. Recent experiments identified that small molecules can be introduced as antiviral agents to bind with the pseudoknot and disrupt its stimulation of -1 PRF. If successfully developed, small molecule therapy that targets -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 is an excellent strategy to improve patients prognoses. Crucial to developing these successful therapies is modeling the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot. Following a structural alignment approach, we identify similarities in the -1 PRF pseudoknots of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the original SARS-CoV, as well as a third coronavirus: MERS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In addition, we provide a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot by comprehensively investigating the structural landscape using a hierarchical folding approach. Since understanding the impact of mutations is vital to long-term success of treatments that are based on predicted RNA functional structures, we provide insight on SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot sequence mutations and their effect on the resulting structure and its function.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu; Carlos Torruco-Sotelo; Felipe Jurado,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.298604""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.298604,2020-09-15,2020-09-15,,False

ObjectiveWe sought to investigate the representation of neutrophil subsets in severe and critical COVID-19 patients based on Intensive Care Units (ICU) and non-ICU admission.

MethodsWe developed a multi-parametric neutrophil profiling strategy based on known neutrophil markers to distinguish COVID-19 phenotypes in critical and severe patients.

ResultsOur results showed that 80% of ICU patients develop strong myelemia with CD10-CD64+ immature neutrophils. Cellular profiling revealed two distinct neutrophil subsets expressing either the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) or the Interleukin-3 receptor alpha (CD123), both significantly overrepresented in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. The proportion of LOX-1-expressing immature neutrophils positively correlated with clinical severity, with the cytokine storm (IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, TNF), and with intravascular coagulation. Importantly, high proportions of LOX-1+-immature neutrophils are associated with high risks of severe thrombosis.

Initial tests showed that this subclass of HCV protease inhibitors indeed exhibited activity against Mpro. Postulating a benefit for a preorganized backbone conformation, we designed new ketoamide-based Mpro inhibitors based on central proline rings. One of the designed compounds, ML1000, inhibits Mpro with low-nanomolar affinity and suppresses SARSCoV2 viral replication in human cells at sub-micromolar concentrations.

Surveillance systems form the foundation stone of active case finding, testing and contact tracing, which are the key components of the public health response to this novel, emerging infectious disease . There is uncertainty about the true proportion of patients who remain asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at a given time. As per the WHO-China Joint Monitoring Mission Report, and an analysis of 21 published reports, anywhere between 5 and 80 per cent of SARS CoV 2 infected patients have been noted to be asymptomatic. Whereas in India 4197563 cases are positive, in which in West Bengal total 180788 cases (4.04% of Cases of India) positive of COVID 19. In Paschim Medinipur (West Medinipur) district contributing total 5489 cases (3.03% cases of West Bengal). In this scenario, we want to know the status of IgG seroprevalence of SARS CoV 2 among asymptomatic general population, so that we can determine the extent of infection of SARS CoV 2 in general population. Objectives: Primary Objective: To estimate the seroprevalence for SARS CoV 2 infection in the general asymptomatic population at Paschim Medinipur District. Secondary Objectives: To estimate age and sex specific seroprevalence. To determine the socio demographic risk factors for SARS CoV 2 infection; To determine the other risk factors like comorbidities, vaccination status, travel history, contact history etc.; To determine the durability of Immunity (IgG) conferred by natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals previously RTPCR positive. Methodology: It was a cross sectional 30 cluster study among the population of Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal conducted in last week of July and 1st week of August 2020 among 458 asymptomatic general population and 30 RTPCR positive cases in 30 villages or wards of municipalities. 30 clusters were chosen from list of COVID 19 affected villages/wards of municipality as per PPS (Probability Proportional to Size) method. Results: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for SARS CoV 2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Among risk factors, the risk of having IgG is more in persons having Travel history with odds ratio of 2.99- 95%CI (1.17-7.65) with p-value- 0.02. Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis with Odds ratio of 8.49- 95% CI(1.59-45.19) with p value - 0.003. Occupation as migrant labour with Odds ratio of 5.08- 95% CI(1.96-13.18) with p value of 0.001. H/O Chicken pox with Odds ratio of 2.15- 95% CI(0.59-7.79) with p value of 0.017. Influenza vaccinated with Odds ratio of 8.07 with 95% CI (0.8-81.48) with a p value of 0.036.

407,The Immune-Buffer COVID-19 Exit Strategy that Protects the Elderly,"COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus with frequent symptoms of fever and shortness of breath. COVID-19 has a high mortality rate among elders. The virus has spread world-wide, leading to shut-down of many countries around the globe with the aim of stopping the spread of the disease. To date, there are uncertainties regarding the main factors in the disease spread, so sever social distancing measures and broad testing are required in order to protect the population at risk. With the increasing spread of the virus, there is growing fraction of the general population that may be immune to COVID-19, following infection. This immunised cohort can be uncovered via large-scale screening for the SARS-CoV-2 (Corona) virus and/or its antibodies. We propose that this immune cohort be deployed as a buffer between the general population and the population most at risk from the disease. Here we show that under a broad range of realistic scenarios deploying such an immunized buffer between the general population and the population at risk may lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of deaths from the disease. This provides an impetus for: screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or its antibodies on the largest scale possible, and organizing at the family, community, national and international levels to protect vulnerable populations by deploying immunized buffers between them and the general population wherever possible.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu; Carlos Torruco-Sotelo; Felipe Jurado,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.20193094""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.20193094,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True

Our results indicate that, prior to significant public health interventions, the reproductive numbers for a majority (10) of these outbreaks are similar, with median posterior estimates ranging between 1.4 and 2.8. These estimates provide a view which is complementary to that provided by those based on traditional line listing data. The genomic-based view is arguably less susceptible to biases resulting from differences in testing protocols, testing intensity, and import of cases into the community of interest. In the analyses reported here, the genomic data primarily provides information regarding which samples belong to a particular outbreak. We observe that once these outbreaks are identified, the sampling dates carry the majority of the information regarding the reproductive number. Finally, we provide genome-based estimates of the cumulative case counts for each outbreak, which allow us to speculate on the amount of unreported infections within the populations housing each outbreak. These results indicate that for the majority (7) of the populations studied, the number of recorded cases is much bigger than the estimated cumulative case counts, suggesting the presence of unsequenced pathogen diversity in these populations.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu; Carlos Torruco-Sotelo; Felipe Jurado,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.20193284""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.20193284,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True

The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of COVID-19 in both space and time in Malawi. Methods: The study used publicly available data of COVID-19 cases for the period from 24th June to 20th August, 2020. Semiparametric spatial temporal models were fitted to the number of weekly confirmed cases as an outcome data, with time and location as independent variables. Results: The study found significant main effect of location and time with the two interacting. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 showed major cities being at greater risk than rural areas. Over time the COVID-19 risk was increasing then decreasing in most districts with the rural districts being consistently at lower risk. Conclusion.

410,Environment influences SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions,"As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, it is increasingly important to understand the factors that influence its transmission. Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, UV radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States of America, we explore correlates of transmission across USA states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modelling. We find that policy intervention (`lockdown') and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but in their absence lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioural changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of SARS-CoV-2, its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu; Carlos Torruco-Sotelo; Felipe Jurado; Hector Serna-secundino; Cristina Aguilar; Jose Garcia-Olanzaran; Diana Hernandez-Garcia; Emma Jones; Michael Usher; Jeffrey Chipman; R.

411,Inequality in access to health and care services during lockdown - Findings from the COVID-19 survey in five UK national longitudinal studies,"Background: Access to health services and adequate care is influenced by sex, ethnicity, socio-economic position (SEP) and burden of co-morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. Methods: Participants were from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). A web and telephone-based survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received during the UK COVID-19 national lockdown. Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study-design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, keyworker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts and meta-regression evaluated the effect of age as a moderator. Findings: 14891 participants were included. Females (OR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [1.27,1.55]) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84 [1.65-2.05]) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR approx. 2.00, all p<0.002). Age was not independently associated with either outcome in meta-regression. SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Interpretation: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly females, ethnic-minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a second wave.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu; Carlos Torruco-Sotelo; Felipe Jurado; Hector Serna-secundino; Cristina Aguilar; Jose Garcia-Olanzaran; Diana Hernandez-Garcia; Emma Jones,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.20191973""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.20191973,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
412,Lack of consideration of sex and gender in clinical trials for COVID-19,"Sex and gender differences impact the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality. Furthermore, sex differences characterize the frequency and severity of pharmacological side effects. A large number of clinical trials are ongoing to develop new therapeutic approaches and vaccines for COVID-19. We investigated the inclusion of sex and/or gender in currently registered studies on ClinicalTrials.gov. Only 416 (16.7%) of the 2,484 registered SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 trials mention sex/gender as recruitment criterion and only 103 (4.1%) allude to sex/gender in the description of the analysis phase. None of the 11 clinical trials published in scientific journals on June 2020 reported sex-disaggregated results. Hence, lack of consideration upon registration does not seem to be corrected during trial execution and reporting. Given the biological relevance and the potential risks of unwanted side effects, we urge researchers to focus on sex-disaggregated analyses already at the planning stage of COVID-19 trials.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu; Carlos Torruco-Sotelo; Felipe Jurado,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193680""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193680,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
413,Differences in innate Intracellular viral suppression competencies may explain variations in morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ravage the world with wide variations in morbidity and mortality that have remained largely unexplained, even by mutations in protein coding regions. In this study, we analyzed available complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences using the CpG index as a signature of Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) activity to examine population variations in innate intracellular antiviral competencies. The result suggests that differential ZAP activity may be a major determinant of the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Africa, Asia, and pools of asymptomatic patients had I_CpG signature evidence of high ZAP activity, while SARS-CoV-2 sequences from North America and Intensive Care Unit or Deceased patients had I_CpG signature of low ZAP activity. ZAP activity is linked to the interferon system. Low ZAP activity may be part of the explanation for the increased morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly and with comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. It may also provide some insight into the discrepancies between invitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of candidate therapies and performance in clinical trials. Furthermore, our results suggest that asymptomatic patients may paradoxically shed a more dangerous virus.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu; Carlos Torruco-Sotelo; Felipe Jurado; Hector Serna-secundino,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193524""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193524,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
414,Characterizing COVID-19 Clinical Phenotypes and Associated Comorbidities and Complication Profiles,"Background: There is limited understanding of heterogeneity in outcomes across hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may facilitate tailored therapy and improve outcomes. Objective: Identify specific clinical phenotypes across COVID-19 patients and compare admission characteristics and outcomes. Design, Settings, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of 1,022 COVID-19 patient admissions from 14 Midwest U.S. hospitals between March 7, 2020 and August 25, 2020. Methods: Ensemble clustering was performed on a set of 33 vitals and labs variables collected within 72 hours of admission. K-means based consensus clustering was used to identify three clinical phenotypes. Principal component analysis was performed on the average covariance matrix of all imputed datasets to visualize clustering and variable relationships. Multinomial regression models were fit to further compare patient comorbidities across phenotype classification. Multivariable models were fit to estimate the association between phenotype and in-hospital complications and clinical outcomes. Main outcomes and measures: Phenotype classification (I, II, III), patient characteristics associated with phenotype assignment, in-hospital complications, and clinical outcomes including ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Results: The database included 1,022 patients requiring hospital admission with COVID-19 (median age, 62.1 [IQR: 45.9-75.8] years; 481 [48.6%] male, 412 [40.3%] required ICU admission, 437 [46.7%] were white). Three clinical phenotypes were identified (I, II, III); 236 [23.1%] patients had phenotype I, 613 [60%] patients had phenotype II, and 173 [16.9%] patients had phenotype III. When grouping comorbidities by organ system, patients with respiratory comorbidities were most commonly characterized by phenotype III (p=0.002), while patients with hematologic (p<0.001), renal (p<0.001), and cardiac (p<0.001) comorbidities were most commonly characterized by phenotype I. The adjusted odds of respiratory (p<0.001), renal (p<0.001), and metabolic (p<0.001) complications were highest for patients with phenotype I, followed by phenotype II. Patients with phenotype I had a far greater odds of hepatic (p<0.001) and hematological (p=0.02) complications than the other two phenotypes. Phenotypes I and II were associated with 7.30-fold (HR: 7.30, 95% CI: (3.11-17.17), p<0.001) and 2.57-fold (HR: 2.57, 95% CI: (1.10-6.00), p=0.03) increases in the hazard of death, respectively, when compared to phenotype III. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19, three clinical phenotypes were identified.

Severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care was reported in up to 5% of cases. There is, however, limited information available in Mexico. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, and outcomes in a COVID-19 cohort attended to from March to May 2020 in our RICU. In addition, we explored the association of clinical variables with mortality. Methods: The first consecutive patients admitted to the RICU from March 3, 2020, to Jun 24, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a logistic regression model. The survival endpoint was mortality at discharge from the RICU. Results: Data from 68 consecutive patients were analyzed. Thirty-eight patients survived, and 30 died (mortality: 44.1 %). Of the 16 predictive variables analyzed, only 6 remained significant in the multivariate analysis [OR (95% confidence interval)]: no acute kidney injury (AKI)/AKI 1: [.61 (.001;.192)]; delta lymphocyte count: [.061 (.006;.619)]; delta ventilatory ratio: [8.19 (1.40;47.8)]; norepinephrine support at admission: [34.3 (2.1;550)]; body mass index: [1.41 (1.09;1.83)]; and bacterial coinfection: [18.5 (1.4;232)].

417,Role of Weather Factors in COVID-19 Deaths in Tropical Climate: A Data-Driven Study Focused on Brazil,"Background: Brazil reported 123,780 deaths across 27 administrative regions, making it the second-worst affected country after the US in terms of COVID-19 deaths as of 3 September 2020. Understanding the role of weather factors in COVID-19 in Brazil is helpful in the long-term mitigation strategy of COVID-19 in other tropical countries because Brazil experienced early large-scale outbreak among tropical countries. Recent COVID-19 studies indicate that relevant weather factors such as temperature, humidity, UV Index (UVI), precipitation, ozone, pollution and cloud cover may influence the spread of COVID-19. Yet, the magnitude and direction of those associations remain inconclusive. Furthermore, there is only limited research exploring the impact of these weather factors in a tropical country like Brazil. In this observational study, we outline the roles of 7 relevant weather factors including temperature, humidity, UVI, precipitation, ozone, pollution (visibility) and cloud cover in COVID-19 deaths in Brazil. Methods: We use a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 27 administrative regions in Brazil across 182 days (n=3882) and analyze the role of relevant weather factors by using daily cumulative COVID-19 deaths in Brazil as the dependent variable. We carry out robustness checks using case-fatality-rate (CFR) as the dependent variable. Findings: We control for all time-fixed and various time-varying region-specific factors confounding factors. We observe a significant negative association of COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate in Brazil with weather factors - UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover. Specifically, a unit increase in UVI, maximum temperature, and ozone independently associate with 6.0 percentage points [p<0.001], 1.8 percentage points [p<0.01] and 0.3 percentage points [p<0. 1] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Further, a unit percentage increase in cloud cover associates with a decline of 0.148 percentage points [p<0.05] in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Surprisingly, contrary to other studies, we do not find evidence of any association between COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate and humidity, visibility and precipitation. We find our results to be consistent even when we use the CFR as the dependent variable. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover in mitigating COVID-19 deaths, even in a tropical country like Brazil. We observe these results to be consistent across various model specifications, especially for UVI and cloud cover, even after incorporating additional time-varying weather parameters such as dewpoint, pressure, wind speed and wind gust.

419,"The impact of natural disasters on the spread of COVID-19: a geospatial, agent based epidemiology model","Background: Natural disasters and infectious diseases are global issues, resulting in widespread disruption to human health and livelihood. At the scale of a global pandemic, the co-occurrence of natural disasters is inevitable. However, the impact of natural disasters on the spread of COVID-19 has not been extensively evaluated using agent based epidemiology models. Methods: We create an agent-based epidemiology model based on both COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological data and geographic data. We first model 35 scenarios with varying natural disaster timing and duration for a COVID-19 outbreak in a theoretical region. We then evaluate the potential effect of an eruption of Vesuvius volcano on the spread of COVID-19 in Campania, Italy. Our objective is to determine if the occurrence of a natural disaster during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase infection cases and disease related fatalities. Results: In a majority of cases, the occurrence of a natural disaster increases the number of disease related fatalities. When the natural disaster occurs at the beginning of the outbreak within a given region, there is little to no increase in the progression of disease spread. However, the occurrence of a natural disaster close to the peak of infections may increase the number of fatalities by more than five-fold. In a theoretical test case, for a natural disaster that occurred fifty days after first infection case, the median increase in fatalities is 2%, 59%, and 180% for a 2, 14, and 31-day long natural disaster respectively, when compared to the no natural disaster scenario. Conclusion: We propose that the compound risk from natural disasters is greatest in the case of already widespread disease outbreak. The key risk factors for increase in spread of infection and disease related fatalities are the timing of the natural disaster relative to the peak in infections and the duration of the natural disaster.",Maximillian S Van Wyk de Vries; Lekaashree Rambabu,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.20193433""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.12.20193433,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
420,Mental health service activity during COVID-19 lockdown among individuals with Personality Disorders: South London and Maudsley data on services and mortality from January to May 2020,"The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a widespread impact on mental healthcare for both services themselves and the people accessing those services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemic first wave. However, there is a need to understand this further for specific groups, including those diagnosed with a personality disorder who might have particular vulnerabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with personality disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st May 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with personality disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with personality disorder over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. Liaison and Older Adult teams showed the largest drop in caseloads, whereas Early Intervention in Psychosis service caseloads remained the same.

421,The impact of digital contact tracing on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - a comprehensive modelling study,"Contact tracing is one of several strategies employed in many countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Digital contact tracing (DCT) uses tools such as cell-phone applications to improve tracing speed and reach. We model the impact of DCT on the spread of the virus for a large epidemiological parameter space consistent with current literature on SARS-CoV-2. We also model DCT in combination with random testing (RT) and social distancing (SD). Modelling is done with two independently developed individual-based (stochastic) models that use the Monte Carlo technique, benchmarked against each other and against two types of deterministic models. For current best estimates of the number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers (approximately 40\%), their contagiousness (similar to that of symptomatic carriers), the reproductive number before interventions (R0 at least 3) we find that DCT must be combined with other interventions such as SD and/or RT to push the reproductive number below one. At least 60\% of the population would have to use the DCT system for its effect to become significant. On its own, DCT cannot bring the reproductive number below 1 unless nearly the entire population uses the DCT system and follows quarantining and testing protocols strictly. For lower uptake of the DCT system, DCT still reduces the number of people that become infected. When DCT is deployed in a population with an ongoing outbreak where O(0.1\%) of the population have already been infected, the gains of the DCT intervention come at the cost of requiring up to 15% of the population to be quarantined (in response to being traced) on average each day for the duration of the epidemic, even when there is sufficient testing capability to test every traced person.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen; Wanying Lu; Zeyao Zhao; Juan Yang; Cecile Viboud; Marco Ajelli; Daniel T Leung; Hongjie Yu; Mohammed Alqahtani; Khalid Abdalla; Yousif Yousif,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20192682""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20192682,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study, based on an online survey, collected demographic data and mental distress outcomes from 184 HCWs from May 1st, 2020, to June,15th, 2020, from 45 different countries. The degree of secondary traumatization was assessed using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), the degrees of perceived stress and burnout were assessed with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk and protective factors for STS. Results: 184 HCWs (M=90; Age mean: 46.45; SD:11.02) completed the survey. A considerable proportion of HCWs had symptoms of secondary traumatic stress (41.3%), emotional exhaustion (56.0%), and depersonalization (48.9%). The prevalence of secondary traumatic stress in frontline HCWs was 47.5% while in HCWs working in other units it was 30.3% (p<.023); additionally, the prevalence of the same outcome was 67.1% for the HCWs exposed to patients' death and 32.9% for those HCWs which were not exposed to the same condition (p<.001). In stepwise multiple regression analysis, perceived stress, emotional exhaustion and exposure to patients' death remained as significant predictors in the final model for secondary traumatic stress (adjusted R2 =0.537, p<0.001).

A primary aim for utilization of serological tests are to better quantify the number of COVID-19 cases including those RT-PCR samples were negative but showing clinical and radiological signs of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to report the features of the patients that were diagnosed and treated as possible COVID-19 cases whose multiple nasopharyngeal swab samples were negative by RT-PCR but serological IgM/IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by rapid antibody test. Method: We retrospectively analyzed eighty suspected COVID-19 cases that have at least two negative consecutive COVID-19 PCR test and were subjected to serological rapid antibody test. Result: The specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as positive in twenty-two patients. The mean age of patient group was 63.2+-13.1 years old with male /female ratio 11/11. Cough was the most common symptom with 90.9%. Most common presenting chest CT findings were bilateral ground glass opacities (77.2%) and alveolar consolidations (50.09%).

424,"Rapid, accurate, nucleobase detection using FnCas9","Rapid detection of pathogenic sequences or variants in DNA and RNA through a point-of-care diagnostic approach is valuable for accelerated clinical prognosis as has been witnessed during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Traditional methods relying on qPCR or sequencing are difficult to implement in settings with limited resources necessitating the development of accurate alternative testing strategies that perform robustly. Here, we present FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that employs a direct Cas9 based enzymatic readout for detecting nucleotide sequences and identifying nucleobase identity without the requirement of trans-cleavage activity of reporter molecules. We demonstrate that FELUDA is 100% accurate in detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) including heterozygous carriers of a mutation and present a simple design strategy in the form of a web-tool, JATAYU, for its implementation.

425,Sensing of COVID-19 Antibodies in Seconds via Aerosol Jet Printed Three Dimensional Electrodes,"Rapid diagnosis is critical for the treatment and prevention of diseases. In this research, we report sensing of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus in seconds via an electrochemical platform consisting of gold micropillar array electrodes decorated with reduced graphene oxide and functionalized with recombinant viral antigens. The array electrodes are fabricated by Aerosol Jet (AJ) nanoparticle 3D printing, where gold nanoparticles (3-5nm) are assembled in 3D space, sintered, and integrated with a microfluidic device. The device is shown to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein and its receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at concentrations down to 1pM via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and read by a smartphone-based user interface. In addition, the sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low-pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive testing of multiple antibody samples using the same sensor. The detection time for the two antibodies tested in this work is 11.5 seconds. S1 protein sensing of its antibodies is specific, which cross-reacts neither with other antibodies nor with proteins such as Nucleocapsid antibody and Interleukin-6 protein. The proposed sensing platform is generic and can also be used for the rapid detection of biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika, which will benefit the public health.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen; Wanying Lu; Zeyao Zhao; Juan Yang,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193722""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193722,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
426,Genome sequencing of sewage detects regionally prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Viral genome sequencing has guided our understanding of the spread and extent of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes are usually sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs of individual patients to track viral spread. Recently, RT-qPCR of municipal wastewater has been used to quantify the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in several regions globally. However, metatranscriptomic sequencing of wastewater can be used to profile the viral genetic diversity across infected communities. Here, we sequenced RNA directly from sewage collected by municipal utility districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to generate complete and near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The major consensus SARS-CoV-2 genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region. Using a pipeline for single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling in a metagenomic context, we characterized minor SARS-CoV-2 alleles in the wastewater and detected viral genotypes which were also found within clinical genomes throughout California. Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the US or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identified in genomes from patients sampled outside of CA, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing. These results demonstrate that epidemiological surveillance through wastewater sequencing can aid in tracking exact viral strains in an epidemic context.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen; Wanying Lu; Zeyao Zhao; Juan Yang; Cecile Viboud; Marco Ajelli; Daniel T Leung; Hongjie Yu; Mohammed Alqahtani; Khalid Abdalla; Yousif Yousif; Fouad AboGazalah; Fuad Awwad; Khaled AlabdulKareem; Fahad AlGhofaili,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193805""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193805,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True

Methods: Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. A portion of participants were also asked about sample acceptability. Samples underwent molecular testing using multiple assays. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day one, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Results: 50 participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40) while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean 4.9) and HCW-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean 3.1).

Here, we used data collected from contact tracing during the lockdown in Punjab, a major state in India, to quantify this heterogeneity, and to examine implications for transmission dynamics. We found evidence of heterogeneity acting at multiple levels: in the number of potentially infectious contacts per index case, and in the per-contact risk of infection. Incorporating these findings in simple mathematical models of disease transmission reveals that these heterogeneities act in combination to strongly influence transmission dynamics. Standard approaches, such as representing heterogeneity through secondary case distributions, could be biased by neglecting these underlying interactions between heterogeneities. We discuss implications for policy, and for more efficient contact tracing in resource-constrained settings such as India. Our results highlight how contact tracing, an important public health measure, can also provide important insights into epidemic spread and control.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20190017""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20190017,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
430,Slight reduction in SARS-CoV-2 exposure viral load due to masking results in a significant reduction in transmission with widespread implementation,"Masks are a vital tool for limiting SARS-CoV-2 spread in the population. Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~50%. Slight increases in masking relative to current levels would reduce the reproductive number substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks that reduce transmission risk by 50% will lower exposure viral load 10-fold among people who do get infected, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy is only effective for this indication as post-exposure prophylaxis, specifically if given to ~50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193508""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.20193508,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True

432,Genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts preferentially escape global suppression of translation by the SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 protein,"Viruses rely on the host translation machinery to synthesize their own proteins. Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, NSP1, for shutting down host translation. Despite this, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing NSP1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes preferentially translated in the context of NSP1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we also uncover potential mechanisms of preferential translation through the presence of shared sites for specific RNA binding proteins and a remarkable enrichment for 5' terminal oligo-pyrimidine tracts. Collectively, the present study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by NSP1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen; Wanying Lu; Zeyao Zhao,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.295493""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.295493,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,False
433,SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein forms condensates with viral genomic RNA,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes COVID-19, a pandemic that seriously threatens global health. SARS CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein forms biomolecular condensates with viral RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. While the N protein forms spherical assemblies with unstructured RNA, it forms mesh like-structures with viral RNA strands that contain secondary structure elements. Cross-linking mass spectrometry identified an intrinsically-disordered region that forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation. By screening 1,200 FDA approved drugs in vitro, we identified a kinase inhibitor nilotinib, which affects the morphology of N condensates in vitro and disrupts phase separation of the N protein in vivo. These results indicate that the N protein compartmentalizes viral RNA in infected cells through liquid-liquid phase separation, and this process can be disrupted by a possible drug candidate.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen; Wanying Lu; Zeyao Zhao; Juan Yang,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.295824""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.14.295824,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,False

436,Ambroxol Hydrochloride Inhibits the Interaction between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Spike Protein's Receptor Binding Domain and Recombinant Human ACE2.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), enters the host cells through two main pathways, both involving key interactions between viral envelope-anchored spike glycoprotein of the novel coronavirus and the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected up to 26 million people worldwide; yet, there is no clinically approved drug or vaccine available. Therefore, a rapid and coordinated effort to re-purpose clinically approved drugs that prevent or disrupt these critical entry pathways of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with human ACE2, could potentially accelerate the identification and clinical advancement of prophylactic and/or treatment options against COVID-19, thus providing possible countermeasures against viral entry, pathogenesis and survival. Herein, we discovered that Ambroxol hydrochloride (AMB), and its progenitor, Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH), both clinically approved drugs are potent effective modulators of the key interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2. We also found that both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect at micromolar concentrations. Therefore, in addition to the known TMPRSS2 activity of BHH; we report for the first time that the BHH and AMB pharmacophore has the capacity to target and modulate yet another key protein-protein interaction essential for the two known SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways into host cells.

It is now known, however, that many other biological systems are affected, including the central nervous system (CNS). Neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, and psychiatric conditions have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but its neurotropic potential is still debated. Here, we investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain from an infant patient deceased from COVID-19. The susceptibility to virus infection was compatible with the expression levels of viral receptor ACE2, which is increased in the ChP in comparison to other brain areas. To better comprehend the dynamics of the viral infection in neural cells, we exposed human neurospheres to SARS-CoV-2. Similarly to the human tissue, we found viral RNA in neurospheres, although viral particles in the culture supernatant were not infective. Based on our observations in vivo and in vitro, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 does not generate productive infection in developing neural cells and that infection of ChP weakens the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier allowing viruses, immune cells, and cytokines to access the CNS, causing neural damage in the young brain.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293951""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.293951,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,False

We then identified the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) stalk as a major cause of spike metastability, designed an HR2-deleted glycine-capped spike (S2G{Delta}HR2), and displayed S2G{Delta}HR2 on three SApNPs with high yield, purity, and antigenicity. Compared to the RBD, the RBD-ferritin SApNP elicited a more potent murine neutralizing antibody (NAb) response on par with the spike. S2G{Delta}HR2 elicited two-fold-higher NAb titers than the proline-capped spike (S2P), while S2G{Delta}HR2 SApNPs derived from multilayered E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers elicited up to 10-fold higher NAb titers. The S2G{Delta}HR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP also induced critically needed T-cell immunity, thereby providing a next-generation vaccine candidate to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.

441,The major predictors of testing positive for COVID-19 among symptomatic hospitalized patients,"Introduction: Increasing corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pre-test probability can minimize testing patients who are less likely to have COVID-19 and therefore reducing personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing kit use. The aim of this study was to identify patients who were likely to test positive for COVID-19 among symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 during hospitalization by comparing COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were [&ge;]18 years old and underwent COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction test because they presented with symptoms thought to be due to COVID-19. The Poisson regression analysis was conducted after clinical presentation, demographic, medical co-morbidities, laboratory and chest image data was retrieved from the medical records. Results: Charts of 277 and 35 COVID-19 negative and positive patients respectively were analyzed. Dyspnea (61%) was the most common symptom among COVID-19 negative patients, while 83% and 77% COVID-19 positive patients had cough and fever respectively. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to present initially with cough [1.082 (1.022 - 1.145)] and fever [1.066 (1.013 - 1.122)], besides being males [1.066 (1.013 - 1.123)] and 50 to 69 years old [1.090 (1.019 - 1.166)]. Dyspnea, weakness, lymphopenia and bilateral chest image abnormality were not associated with COVID-19 positivity. COVID-19 positive patients were less likely to have non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [0.934 (0.893 - 0.976)], human immunodeficiency virus [0.847 (0.763 - 0.942)] and heart failure history [0.945 (0.908 - 0.984)]. Other chronic medical problems (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease) were not associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: Cough and fever are better predictors of symptomatic COVID-19 positivity during hospitalization.

The Abbott Architect Nucleocapsid IgG assay was used to determine seropositivity. Logistic regression models (unadjusted and adjusted for demographics and self-reported community exposure to COVID-19) were fit to quantify the associations between occupation group, healthcare delivery tasks, and community exposure and seropositive status. Results: 6,510 HCWs, including 1,794 nurses, and 904 non-patient facing administrators participated.

The last search was conducted on 9th July 2020. Study Selection: Studies reporting data on RAAS blocker use and COVID-19 mortality and severity were included in the review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Mortality data and severity data including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ventilation, steroid use and acute kidney injury (AKI) were recorded. Pooled Odds ratio (OR) estimates were reported with 95% CIs and level of heterogeneity (I2). Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds of mortality in users of RAAS blockers with respect to non-users was the primary outcome. Odds of severity, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, steroid use, and AKI in users with respect to non-users of RAAS blockers were the secondary outcomes. Results: Of 1348 articles identified, 48 published studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 26432 patients from 31 studies included in mortality analysis and 20127 patients from 23 studies included in severity analysis. Majority of the studies (41.6%) were from China. No increased risk of mortality (Pooled OR 0.91 (0.65-1.26), I2=89%) or severity (Pooled OR 1.08 (0.79-1.46), I2=88%) was seen with RAAS blockers. The drug class was protective in hypertension (pooled OR 0.63 (0.46-0.86), I2=58%). Severity of COVID-19 outcomes was found to be high for Europeans (Pooled OR 2.08 (1.52-2.85), I2=77%) and US patients (Pooled OR 1.87 (1.62-2.17) in users of RAAS-blockers. A nearly 4 times higher risk of hospitalization, two times higher risk of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was observed in US patients on RAAS blockers. No net effect on mortality and severity outcomes was seen in Chinese patients. RAAS blocker usage did not have any effect on corticosteroid use and AKI in Chinese patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Use of RAAS blockers is not associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Reduced mortality is seen in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and therefore the drugs should be continued in this subset. US and European patients are at higher risk of severe outcomes.

While molecular assays are used to detect viral genetic material for the diagnosis of acute infection, reliable serological assays are needed to measure immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In this report, we describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects antibodies against the following SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins: the full-length spike (S) protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Our assay is sensitive and specific for immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA and IgM anti-S protein and anti-RBD antibodies. Samples were pre-treated with Triton X-100 to inactivate potential virus without affecting antibody detection. Our in-house ELISA performed as well as the commercial EUROIMMUN and Ortho assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

446,The Effect of Early Hydroxychloroquine-based Therapy in COVID-19 Patients in Ambulatory Care Settings: A Nationwide Prospective Cohort Study,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no proven effective therapy nor vaccine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Evidence regarding the potential benefit of early administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in symptomatic patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is not clear. METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study took place in 238 ambulatory fever clinics in Saudi Arabia, which followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 treatment guideline. This guideline included multiple treatment options for COVID-19 based on the best available evidence at the time, among which was Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with confirmed COVD-19 (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) who presented to these clinics with mild to moderate symptoms during the period from 5-26 June 2020 were included in this study. Our study looked at those who received HCQ-based therapy along with supportive care (SC) and compared them to patients who received SC alone. The primary outcome was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The secondary outcome was a composite of intensive care admission (ICU) and/or mortality during the follow-up period. Outcome data were assessed through a follow-up telephonic questionnaire at day 28 and were further verified with national hospitalisation and mortality registries. Multiple logistic regression model was used to control for prespecified confounders. RESULTS: Of the 7,892 symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who visited the ambulatory fever clinics during the study period, 5,541 had verified clinical outcomes at day 28 (1,817 patients in the HCQ group vs 3,724 in the SC group). At baseline, patients who received HCQ therapy were more likely to be males who did not have hypertension or chronic lung disease compared to the SC group. No major differences were noted regarding other comorbid conditions. All patients were presenting with active complaints; however, the HCQ groups had higher rates of symptoms compared to the SC group (fever: 84% vs 66.3, headache: 49.8 vs 37.4, cough: 44.5 vs 35.6, respectively). Early HCQ-based therapy was associated with a lower hospital admission within 28-days compared to SC alone (9.4% compared to 16.6%, RRR 43%, p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality at 28-days was also lower in the HCQ group compared to the SC (1.2% compared to 2.6%, RRR 54%, p-value 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, and major comorbid conditions, a multivariate logistic regression model showed a decrease in the odds of hospitalisation in patients who received HCQ compared to SC alone (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality was also lower for the HCQ group compared to the SC group controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019). CONCLUSION: Early intervention with HCQ-based therapy in patients with mild to moderate symptoms at presentation is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients, including hospital admissions, ICU admission, and/or death.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen; Wanying Lu; Zeyao Zhao; Juan Yang; Cecile Viboud; Marco Ajelli; Daniel T Leung; Hongjie Yu; Mohammed Alqahtani; Khalid Abdalla; Yousif Yousif; Fouad AboGazalah; Fuad Awwad; Khaled AlabdulKareem; Fahad AlGhofaili; Ahmed AlJedai; Hani Jokhdar; Fahad Alrabiah,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.09.20184143""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.09.20184143,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
447,On Machine Learning-Based Short-Term Adjustment of Epidemiological Projections of COVID-19 in US,"Epidemiological models have provided valuable information for the outlook of COVID-19 pandemic and relative impact of different mitigation scenarios. However, more accurate forecasts are often needed at near term for planning and staffing. We present our early results from a systemic analysis of short-term adjustment of epidemiological modeling of COVID 19 pandemic in US during March-April 2020. Our analysis includes the importance of various types of features for short term adjustment of the predictions. In addition, we explore the potential of data augmentation to address the data limitation for an emerging pandemic. Following published literature, we employ data augmentation via clustering of regions and evaluate a number of clustering strategies to identify early patterns from the data. From our early analysis, we used CovidActNow as our underlying epidemiological model and found that the most impactful features for the one-day prediction horizon are population density, workers in commuting flow, number of deaths in the day prior to prediction date, and the autoregressive features of new COVID-19 cases from three previous dates of the prediction. Interestingly, we also found that counties clustered with New York County resulted in best preforming model with maximum of R2= 0.90 and minimum of R2= 0.85 for state-based and COVID-based clustering strategy, respectively.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng; Xinghui Chen; Wanying Lu; Zeyao Zhao; Juan Yang; Cecile Viboud; Marco Ajelli; Daniel T Leung; Hongjie Yu,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20180521""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20180521,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
448,Mask-Wearing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background Masks have been widely recommended as a precaution against COVID-19 transmission. Several studies have shown the efficacy of masks at curbing droplet dispersion in lab settings. Using individual response data from the Imperial College London-YouGov personal measures survey, this study investigates reported mask use and its association with the spread of COVID-19. Methods We examine the association of reported mask-wearing in a population within a country with the growth rate of active cases COVID-19 cases. The analysis uses country-wide data from weekly surveys of individuals mask-wearing behavior in public places, as well as other concurrently implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions, mobility changes, new cases of COVID-19 data and other control variables. The mask-wearing data were obtained from the Imperial College-YouGov multi-country survey of peoples personal habits before and during COVID-19. Because mask-wearing showed substantial variation across countries and over time, we use a reduced form econometric model to relate population-wide changes in mask-wearing to the growth rate in COVID-19. Results The results indicate that reported mask-wearing could play an important role in mitigating the growth of COVID-19. Widespread mask-wearing within a country associates with an expected 7% (95% CI: 3.94%-9.99%) decline in the growth rate of daily active cases of COVID-19 in the country. This daily decline equates to an expected 88.5% drop in the growth of daily active cases over a 30-day period when compared to zero percent mask-wearing, all else held equal. The decline in daily growth rate due to the combined effect of reported mask-wearing, reduced social mobility, and non-pharmaceutical interventions averages 28.1% (95% CI: 24.2%-32%). These estimates remain robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Face mask usage as a preventative measure against the transmission of COVID-19 varies widely across countries. This observational study uses data from 24 countries and finds that reported face mask usage associates with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Even though the model controls for a large variety of variables that affect spread, and we run a number of robustness checks, it remains possible that some of the decline associated with face masks is related to confounding variables not included in the model. In summary, due to the confounding variables and the variations in the type of mask and its usage, randomized control trials of mask usage in populations are needed to determine the true effect of mask wearing on mitigating the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases.",Xinhua Chen; Zhiyuan Chen; Andrew S Azman; Xiaowei Deng,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20192971""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20192971,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
449,Serological evidence of human infection with SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: A rapidly increasing number of serological surveys for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been reported worldwide. A synthesis of this large corpus of data is needed. Purpose: To evaluate the quality of serological studies and provide a global picture of seroprevalence across demographic and occupational groups, and to provide guidance for conducting better serosurveys. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN and Wellcome were searched for English-language papers published from December 1, 2019 to August 28, 2020. Study selection: Serological studies that evaluated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. Data extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data from included studies. Data Synthesis: Most of 178 serological studies, representing tests in >800,000 individuals, identified were of low quality. Close contacts and high-risk healthcare workers had higher seroprevalence of 22.9% (95% CI: 11.1-34.7%) and 14.9% (4.8-25.0%), compared to low-risk healthcare workers and general population of 5.5% (4.6-6.4%) and 6.3% (5.5-7.1%). Generally, young people (0-20 yrs) were less likely to be seropositive compared to the middle-aged (21-55 yrs) populations (RR, 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7-0.8). Seroprevalence correlated with clinical COVID-19 reports with 10 (range: 2 to 34) infections per confirmed COVID-19 case. Limitations: Some heterogeneity cannot be well explained quantitatively. Conclusions: The overall quality of seroprevalence studies examined was low. The relatively low seroprevalence among general populations suggest that in most settings, antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached. Given that ratio of infections to confirmed cases is on the same order of magnitude across different locales, reported case numbers may help provide insights into the proportion of the population infected.

Hospitals equipped with electronic medical records can utilize these databases to automatically link cases into possible transmission chains and surface potential new outbreaks. While this automatic contact tracing does not have the richness of contact tracing interviews, it does provide a way for health systems to highlight potential super-spreader events and support their local health departments. Additionally, these data provide insight into how a given infection is spreading locally.

To apprehend the transmission of COVID-19 and the improvement of air quality, we have studied air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, AQI, and NO2), CO2 emission, and climate variables (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) in the extremely polluted and densely populated Southeast Asian megacity Dhaka, Bangladesh from March to June 2020. The Kendall and Spearman correlations were chosen to test the connotation of air quality and climate variables with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and CO2 were 65.0 with STD of 37.9 and 87.1 with STD of 52.8 microgram m-3, and 427 with STD of 11.8 ppm, respectively. The average PM2.5 and PM10 drastically reduced up to 62% during COVID-19 lockdown in Dhaka comparing with March 2020 (before lockdown). Comparing with the same period in 2019, PM2.5 reduced up to 33.5%. The average NO2 concentration was 35.0 micromol m-2 during the lockdown period in April, whereas 175.0 micromol m-2 during March (before lockdown). A significant correlation was observed between COVID-19 cases and air quality indicators. A strong correlation was obtained between climate variables and the total number of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality representing a favorable condition for spreading the virus.

It is used to show how the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus can be spread by the breathing of single infected person. The model shows that the concentration of viruses in the cloud, exhaled by one person, can increase to infectious levels within a certain amount of time, in a confined space where the air re-circulates. In [10] the model was used to analyze the air-flow and SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus build-up in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China [19,18]. In this paper, we add the analysis of two more cases, an outbreak among lay-Buddhists, on a bus [26], traveling to a ceremony in Zhejiang province, China, and an outbreak in a Call Center in Seoul, Korea [20]. The analysis and comparison of these three cases, leads to the conclusion that the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus attacks in two steps: The first step is a linear spread between individuals with a couple of days delay. The second step is an exponential spread effected by the air-conditioning system affecting a much larger number of people.

453,Ignoring the elephant in the room: factors contributing to inadequate access to contraception and sources of contraception during novel coronavirus diseases 2019 in South Africa.,"Background: Evidence have shown that the prescribed lockdown and social distancing due to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made accessing essential health care much more difficult in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Access to contraception is essential and should not be denied, even in the time of a global crisis because it is associated with health benefits. It is paramount to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence, this study examines the factors contributing to inadequate access to contraception and sources of contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa (SA). Method: The first secondary dataset on coronavirus from the National Income Dynamic Study (NIDS) conducted in SA during the coronavirus pandemic was employed in this study. This study involved 6,829 respondents. Data was analysed using chi-square and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Over one-quarter of South Africans could not access contraception and more than every 7 in 10 South Africans preferred public or government hospital as source of contraception. Female South Africans (OR=0.89 CI:0.7487-1.0719) and those aged 65 years above (OR=0.67 CI:0.4485-0.9988) were 33% and 11% respectively less likely to have access to contraception. The preferred sources of contraception were associated with the selected demographic and economic variables at P<0.05. Conclusions: Findings from the study suggests strategies and interventions that will be tailored towards non-obstruction of contraception access during the on-going COVID-19 or any future pandemic.

455,Adapting Lot Quality Assurance Sampling to accommodate imperfect tests: application to COVID-19 serosurveillance in Haiti,"Background: Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), a tool used for monitoring health indicators in low resource settings resulting in ""high"" or ""low"" classifications, assumes that determination of the trait of interest is perfect. This is often not true for diagnostic tests, with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Here, we develop Lot Quality Assurance Sampling for Imperfect Tests (LQAS-IMP) to address this issue and apply it to a COVID-19 serosurveillance study in Haiti. Development: As part of the standard LQAS procedure, the user specifies allowable classification errors for the system, which is defined by a sample size and decision rule. We show that when an imperfect diagnostic test is used, the classification errors are larger than specified. We derive a modified procedure, LQAS-IMP, that accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test to yield correct classification errors. Application: At Zanmi Lasante health facilities in Haiti, the goal was to assess the prior circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) using a limited number of antibody tests. As the COVID-19 antibody tests were known to have imperfect diagnostic accuracy, we used the LQAS-IMP procedure to define valid systems for sampling at eleven hospitals in Haiti. Conclusions: The LQAS-IMP procedure accounts for imperfect sensitivity and specificity in system design; if the accuracy of a test is known, the use of LQAS-IMP extends LQAS to applications for indicators that are based on laboratory tests, such as COVID-19 antibodies.",Ahmed R Din; Annika Hindocha; Tulsi Patel; Sanjana Sudarshan; Neil Cagney,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20193052""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20193052,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
456,Anakinra and Intravenous IgG versus Tocilizumab in the Treatment of COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory failure and an exaggerated inflammatory response. Studies have suggested promising outcomes using monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1{beta} (Anakinra) or IL6 (Tocilizumab), however no head to head comparison was done between the two treatments. Herein, we report our experience in treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm with either subcutaneous Anakinra given concomitantly with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or intravenous Tocilizumab. Methods: Comprehensive clinical and laboratory data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted at our hospital between March and May 2020 were collected. Patients who received either Anakinra/ IVIG or Tocilizumab were selected. Baseline characteristics including oxygen therapy, respiratory status evaluation using ROX index, clinical assessment using NEWS score and laboratory data were collected. Outcomes included mortality, intubation, ICU admission and length of stay. In addition, we compared the change in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers at days 7 and 14 post initiation of therapy. Results: 84 consecutive patients who received either treatment (51 in the Anakinra/ IVIG group and 33 in the Tocilizumab group) were retrospectively studied. Baseline inflammatory markers were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference regarding to death (21.6% vs 15.2%, p 0.464), intubation (15.7% vs 24.2%, p 0.329), ICU need (57.1% vs 48.5%, p 0.475) or length of stay (13+9.6 vs 14.9+11.6, p 0.512) in the Anakinra/IVIG and Tocilizumab, respectively. Additionally, the rate of improvement in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers was similar in both groups at days 7 and 14. Furthermore, there was no difference in the incidence of superinfection in both groups. Conclusion: Treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm features with either subcutaneous Anakinra/IVIG or intravenous Tocilizumab is associated with improved clinical outcomes in most subjects.

The aim was to assess the clinical effectiveness of drugs used in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. Method. We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing treatment with remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, for hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen support, duration of hospitalization), virological clearance, and severe adverse events. Results. A total of 48 studies were retrieved from the databases. Ten articles were finally included in the data extraction and qualitative synthesis of results. The meta-analysis suggests a benefit of dexamethasone versus standard care in the reduction of risk of mortality at day 28; and the clinical improvement at days 14 and 28 in patients treated with remdesivir. Conclusions. Dexamethasone would have a better result in hospitalized patients, especially in low-resources settings. Significance of results. The analysis of the main treatments proposed for hospitalized patients is of vital importance to reduce mortality in low-income countries; since the COVID-19 pandemic had an economic impact worldwide with the loss of jobs and economic decline in countries with scarce resources.

459,Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Associated with SARS-CoV-2; a Multinational Case Series,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 induced coagulopathy can lead to thrombotic complications such as stroke. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a less common type of stroke which might be triggered by COVID-19. We present a series of CVST cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In a multinational retrospective study, we collected all cases of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to nine tertiary stroke centers from the beginning of the pandemic to June 30th, 2020. We compared the demographics, clinical and radiological characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of these patients with a control group of non-SARS-CoV-2 infected CVST patients in the same seasonal period of the years 2012-2016 from the country where the majority of cases were recruited. Results: A total of 13 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (62% women, mean age 50.9 years). Six patients were discharged with good outcomes (mRS[&le;]2) and three patients died in hospital. Compared to the control group, the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were significantly older (50.9 versus 36.7 years, p<0.001), had a lower rate of identified CVST risk factors (23.1% versus 84.2%, p<0.001), had more frequent cortical vein involvement (38.5% versus 10.5%, p: 0.025), and a non-significant higher rate of in-hospital mortality (23.1% versus 5.3%, p: 0.073). Conclusion: CVST should be considered as potential comorbidity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting with neurological symptoms.

460,SARS2 simplified scores to estimate risk of hospitalization and death among patients with COVID-19,"Although models have been developed for predicting severity of COVID-19 based on the medical history of patients, simplified risk prediction models with good accuracy could be more practical. In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic health records were queried from 02/26/2020 to 07/14/2020 to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit a generalized linear model for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. On the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI: 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization outcome, and 0.72 [95% CI: 0.69-0.74] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status.

The antigen specificity and kinetics of the antibody response mounted against this novel virus are not understood in detail. Here, we report that subjects with a more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit a larger antibody response against the spike and nucleocapsid protein and epitope spreading to subdominant viral antigens, such as open reading frame 8 and non-structural proteins. Subjects with a greater antibody response mounted a larger memory B cell response against the spike, but not the nucleocapsid protein. Additionally, we revealed that antibodies against the spike are still capable of binding the D614G spike mutant and cross-react with the SARS-CoV-1 receptor binding domain.

463,Evaluation of stability and inactivation methods of SARS-CoV-2 in context of laboratory settings,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the acute respiratory disease COVID-19, which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread. Laboratory work with SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory setting was rated to biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. However, certain research applications in particular in molecular biology require incomplete denaturation of the proteins, which might cause safety issues handling contaminated samples. In particular, it is critical to provide proof of inactivation before samples can be removed from the BSL-3.

In this study, we evaluated common lysis buffers that are used in molecular biological laboratories for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. We have found that guanidine thiocyanate, SDS, and Triton-X containing lysis buffers were effective in inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, however, the M-PER lysis buffer containing a proprietary detergent failed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, we compared chemical and non-chemical inactivation methods including ethanol, acetone-methanol mixture, PFA, UV-C light, and heat inactivation. In addition, the stability of the virus in cell culture media at 4{degrees}C and on surfaces used in laboratory environment was analyzed.

In conclusion, careful evaluation of the used inactivation methods are required and additional inactivation steps are necessary before removal of lysed viral samples from BSL-3.",Ahmed R Din; Annika Hindocha; Tulsi Patel; Sanjana Sudarshan; Neil Cagney; Amine Koched; Jens-Dominik Mueller,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.292581""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.292581,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,False
464,Age-dependent regulation of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry genes and cell death programs correlates with COVID-19 disease severity,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) maintains cardiovascular and renal homeostasis but also serves as the entry receptor for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. COVID-19 disease severity, while highly variable, is typically lower in pediatric patients than adults (particularly the elderly), but increased rates of hospitalizations requiring intensive care are observed in infants than in older children. The reasons for these differences are unknown. To detect potential age-based correlates of disease severity, we measured ACE2 protein expression at the single cell level in human lung tissue specimens from over 100 donors from [~]4 months to 75 years of age. We found that expression of ACE2 in distal lung epithelial cells generally increases with advancing age but exhibits extreme intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity. Notably, we also detected ACE2 expression on neonatal airway epithelial cells and within the lung parenchyma. Similar patterns were found at the transcript level: ACE2 mRNA is expressed in the lung and trachea shortly after birth, downregulated during childhood, and again expressed at high levels in late adulthood in alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis, which is a natural host defense system against viral infection, is also dynamically regulated during lung maturation, resulting in periods of heightened apoptotic priming and dependence on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins including MCL-1. Infection of human lung cells with SARS-CoV-2 triggers an unfolded protein stress response and upregulation of the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor Noxa; in juveniles, MCL-1 inhibition is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung epithelial cells - this may limit virion production and inflammatory signaling. Overall, we identify strong and distinct correlates of COVID-19 disease severity across lifespan and advance our understanding of the regulation of ACE2 and cell death programs in the mammalian lung. Furthermore, our work provides the framework for potential translation of apoptosis modulating drugs as novel treatments for COVID-19.",Ahmed R Din; Annika Hindocha; Tulsi Patel; Sanjana Sudarshan; Neil Cagney; Amine Koched; Jens-Dominik Mueller; Noha Seoudi; Claire Morgan; Shakeel Shahdad; Padhraig S Fleming; Yunguang Li; Yinqin Zhu; Xiaoyu Zhang,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.276923""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.13.276923,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,False

Here, we presented a new software, called nanoDoc, for detecting PTMs from DRS data using a deep neural network. Current signal deviations caused by PTMs are analyzed via Deep One-Class Classification with a convolutional neural network. Using a ribosomal RNA dataset, the software archive displayed an area under the curve (AUC) accuracy of 0.96 for the detection of 23 different kinds of modifications in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also demonstrated a tentative classification of PTMs using unsupervised clustering.

466,Daytime variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine production,"S. Ray and A. Reddy recently anticipated the implication of circadian rhythm in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In addition to its key role in the regulation of biological functions, the circadian rhythm has been suggested as a regulator of viral infections. Specifically, the time of day of infection was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects. The circadian gene expression of Bmal1 and Clock genes was investigated with q-RTPCR. Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 levels were also measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that Bmal1 and Clock transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at Zeitgeber Time (ZT)6 and ZT17. After forty-eight hours, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus increased in the monocyte infected at ZT6 compared to ZT17. The high virus amount at ZT6 was associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 compared to ZT17. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.

ImportanceThe implication of circadian rhythm (CR) in pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently anticipated. The time of day of infection is critical for illness progression as reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. In this study, we wondered if SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine production by human monocytes, innate immune cells affected by Covid-19, were regulated by CR.

The acceleration of new cases is important for the characterization and comparison of epidemic curves. The objective of this work is to measure the diversity of epidemic curves and understand the importance of socioeconomic variables in the acceleration, peak cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazilian states. Methods: This is an ecological study with time series analysis of new cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazil and its 27 federation units. Using the polynomial interpolation method, we calculated the daily cases and deaths with the measurement of the respective acceleration. We calculated the correlation coefficient between the epidemic curve data and socioeconomic data. Results: The combination of daily data and acceleration determined that the states of Brazil are in different stages of the epidemic. Maximum acceleration of peak cases, peak of cases, maximum acceleration of deaths and peak of deaths are associated with the Gini index and population density, but did not correlate with HDI and per capita income.

468,Type I Interferon Limits Viral Dissemination-Driven Clinical Heterogeneity in a Native Murine Betacoronavirus Model of COVID-19,"Emerging clinical data demonstrates that COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, is a syndrome that variably affects nearly every organ system. Indeed, the clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19 ranges from relatively asymptomatic to severe disease with death resultant from multiple constellations of organ failures. In addition to genetics and host characteristics, it is likely that viral dissemination is a key determinant of disease manifestation. Given the complexity of disease expression, one major limitation in current animal models is the ability to capture this clinical heterogeneity due to technical limitations related to murinizing SARS-CoV2 or humanizing mice to render susceptible to infection. Here we describe a murine model of COVID-19 using respiratory infection with the native mouse betacoronavirus MHV-A59. We find that whereas high viral inoculums uniformly led to hypoxemic respiratory failure and death, lethal dose 50% (LD50) inoculums led to a recapitulation of most hallmark clinical features of COVID-19, including lymphocytopenias, heart and liver damage, and autonomic dysfunction. We find that extrapulmonary manifestations are due to viral metastasis and identify a critical role for type-I but not type-III interferons in preventing systemic viral dissemination. Early, but not late treatment with intrapulmonary type-I interferon, as well as convalescent serum, provided significant protection from lethality by limiting viral dissemination. We thus establish a Biosafety Level II model that may be a useful addition to the current pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 for understanding disease pathogenesis and facilitating therapeutic development for human translation.",Ahmed R Din; Annika Hindocha; Tulsi Patel; Sanjana Sudarshan; Neil Cagney; Amine Koched; Jens-Dominik Mueller; Noha Seoudi; Claire Morgan; Shakeel Shahdad; Padhraig S Fleming; Yunguang Li; Yinqin Zhu; Xiaoyu Zhang; Zhuang Liu; Rebiguli Aji; Xia Cai; Yutang Li; Di Qu; Yu Chen; Shibo Jiang; Qiao Wang; Hongbin Ji; Youhua Xie,"https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.294231""",https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.294231,2020-09-12,2020-09-12,,False
469,Ketogenesis restrains aging-induced exacerbation of COVID in a mouse model,"Increasing age is the strongest predictor of risk of COVID-19 severity. Unregulated cytokine storm together with impaired immunometabolic response leads to highest mortality in elderly infected with SARS-CoV-2. To investigate how aging compromises defense against COVID-19, we developed a model of natural murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 (mCoV-A59) that recapitulated majority of clinical hallmarks of COVID-19. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of {gamma}{delta} T cells in lungs. Ketogenic diet increases beta-hydroxybutyrate, expands tissue protective {gamma}{delta} T cells, deactivates the inflammasome and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice. These data underscore the value of mCoV-A59 model to test mechanism and establishes harnessing of the ketogenic immunometabolic checkpoint as a potential treatment against COVID-19 in the elderly.

Highlights - Natural MHV-A59 mouse coronavirus infection mimics COVID-19 in elderly.
- Aged infected mice have systemic inflammation and inflammasome activation
- Murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection results in loss of pulmonary {gamma}{delta} T cells.
- Ketones protect aged mice from infection by reducing inflammation.

While worldwide efforts are being advanced towards vaccine development, the structural modeling of TCR-pMHC (T Cell Receptor-peptide-bound Major Histocompatibility Complex) regarding SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and the design of effective T cell vaccine based on these antigens are still unresolved. Here, we present both pMHC and TCR-pMHC interfaces to infer peptide epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Accordingly, significant TCR-pMHC templates (Z-value cutoff > 4) along with interatomic interactions within the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptides were clarified. Also, we applied the structural analysis of the hit peptides from different coronaviruses to highlight a feature of evolution in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Peptide-protein flexible docking between each of the hit peptides and their corresponding MHC molecules were performed, and a multi-hit peptides vaccine against the S and N glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was designed. Filtering pipelines including antigenicity, and also physiochemical properties of designed vaccine were then evaluated by different immunoinformatics tools. Finally, vaccine-structure modeling and immune simulation of the desired vaccine were performed aiming to create robust T cell immune responses.

471,Immunologically distinct responses occur in the CNS of COVID-19 patients,"A subset of patients with COVID-19 display neurologic symptoms but it remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 damages the central nervous system (CNS) directly through neuroinvasion, or if neurological symptoms are due to secondary mechanisms, including immune-mediated effects. Here, we examined the immune milieu in the CNS through the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in circulation through analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. Single cell sequencing with paired repertoire sequencing of PBMCs and CSF cells show evidence for unique immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS. Strikingly, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are present in the CSF of all patients studied, but the antibody epitope specificity in the CSF and relative prevalence of B cell receptor sequences markedly differed when compared to those found in paired serum. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrate that localized CNS immune responses occur following viral neuroinvasion, and that the CSF is a faithful surrogate for responses occurring uniquely in the CNS.

472,Distinct mechanisms for TMPRSS2 expression explain organ-specific inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzalutamide,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a global public health threat due to the lack of effective drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs, a relatively new antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry into host cells, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad-ACE2-transduced Tmprss2 knockout (Tmprss2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. TMPRSS2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) but not in human lung cancer cells or patient-derived lung organoids. Although Tmprss2 knockout effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in ACE2-transduced mice, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR independence of TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 in human lung cells.

The replicon was devoid of structural genes spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E).

475,How to Make COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps work: Insights From Behavioral Economics,"Due to network effects, Contact Tracing Apps (CTAs) are only effective if many people download them. However, the response to CTAs has been tepid. For example, in France less than 2 million people (roughly 3% of the population) downloaded the CTA. Against this background, we carry out an online experiment to show that CTAs can still play a key role in containing the spread of COVID-19, provided that they are re-conceptualized to account for insights from behavioral science. We start by showing that carefully devised in-app notifications are effective in inducing prudent behavior like wearing a mask or staying home. In particular, people that are notified that they are taking too much risk and could become a superspreader engage in more prudent behavior. Building on this result, we suggest that CTAs should be re-framed as Behavioral Feedback Apps (BFAs). The main function of BFAs would be providing users with information on how to minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19, like how crowded a store is likely to be. Moreover, the BFA could have a rating system that allows users to flag stores that do not respect safety norms like wearing masks. These functions can inform the behavior of app users, thus playing a key role in containing the spread of the virus even if a small percentage of people download the BFA. While effective contact tracing is impossible when only 3% of the population downloads the app, less risk taking by small portions of the population can produce large benefits. BFAs can be programmed so that users can also activate a tracing function akin to the one currently carried out by CTAs. Making contact tracing an ancillary, opt-in function might facilitate a wider acceptance of BFAs.",Ahmed R Din; Annika Hindocha; Tulsi Patel,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.09.20191320""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.09.20191320,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
476,Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) health awareness among the United Arab Emirates Population,"ABSTRACT Background: In response to the global (COVID-19) epidemic, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government is taking precautionary action to mitigate the spread of the virus and protect the safety and well-being of citizens, residents, and visitors. The knowledge and practices of individuals will probably have an important bearing on the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and practices toward COVID-19 among the general public in the UAE during the current outbreak COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 1356 of respondents in the UAE we conducted during the epidemic outbreak between 9th to 24th June-2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Socio-demographic, participants knowledge, and participants practices. Independent- samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, and binary logistic regression have used. A p-value of (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Results: Of the total sample, 72% were females, 47% % were aged between 30-49 years, 57.2% were from Sharjah, 65.6% had a college degree, and 40.6% were unemployed. The total correct score of knowledge and practices questions was high 85% and 90%, respectively. Males gender, other marital status, and illiterate/primary educational levels had a lower level of knowledge and practices than others. participants aged 18-29 had little higher knowledge than other ages but had a lower level in practices, people who live in Abu Dhabi had better knowledge and practice than other emirates, employed people had a lower level of knowledge but higher in practice. Binary logistic regression analysis presented that females, 18-29 years, and married participants significantly associated with a higher score of knowledge, while female gender, over 30 years old, the martial status of singles, college-level and higher, unemployed, were significantly associated with high mean practice score. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the current study is one of the first studies to evaluate the knowledge and practices of UAE population toward COVID-19. Most of the respondents demonstrate an excellent level of knowledge and awareness as well as proper conscious practices. Continuing to implement the health education programs pursued by the UAE is highly important to maintain the appropriate level of awareness among the public.",Ahmed R Din; Annika Hindocha; Tulsi Patel,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20191890""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20191890,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
477,Mathematical Modeling and a Month Ahead Forecast of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An Indian Scenario,"India, the second-most populous country in the world, has been lately witnessing a daily surge in the COVID-19 infected cases. India is currently among the worst-hit nations worldwide, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ranks just behind Brazil and USA. In order to prevent the further worsening of the situation, predicting the future course of the pandemic is of utmost importance. In this paper, we model the past trajectory (March 01, 2020 - July 25, 2020) and make a month-long (July 26, 2020 - August 24, 2020) forecast of the future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in India using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. According to our forecasting results, India is likely to have 3,800,989 cumulative infected cases, 1,634,142 cumulative active cases, 2,110,697 cumulative recoveries and 56,150 cumulative deaths by August 24, 2020, if the current trend of the pandemic continues to prevail. The implications of these forecasts are that in the upcoming month the infection rate of COVID-19 in India is going to escalate, while as the rate of recovery and the case-fatality rate is likely to reduce. In order to avert these possible scenarios, the administration and health-care personnel need to formulate and implement robust control measures, while the general public needs to be more responsible and strictly adhere to the established and newly formulated guidelines to slow down the spread of the pandemic and prevent it from transforming into a catastrophe.",Ahmed R Din; Annika Hindocha,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20192195""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20192195,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True

479,Quantitative particle analysis of particulate matter release during orthodontic procedures: A pilot study.,"Introduction: Transmission of SARS-Cov-2 through aerosol has been implicated particularly in the presence of highly concentrated aerosols in enclosed environments. It is accepted that aerosols are produced during a range of dental procedures, posing potential risks to both dental practitioners and patients. There has been little agreement concerning aerosol transmission associated with orthodontics and associated mitigation. Methods: Orthodontic procedures were simulated in a closed side-surgery using a dental manikin on an acrylic model using composite-based adhesive. Adhesive removal representing debonding was undertaken using a 1:1 contra-angle handpiece and fast hand-piece with variation in air and water flow. The removal of acid etch was also simulated with use of combined 3-in-1 air water syringe to remove etch. An optical particle scanner and a spectrometer particle scanner were both to assess particulate matter ranging from 'very small' (0.08 - 0.26 um) to large (2.7 - 10 um). Results: Standard debonding procedure (involving air but no water) was associated with clear increase in the very small and small (0.26 - 0.9 um) particles, but only for a short period with no significant increases for other sizes. Debonding procedures without air appeared to produce similar levels of aerosol to standard debonding. Debonding in association with water tended to produce large increase in aerosol levels, producing particles of all sizes throughout the experiment. The use of water and a fast hand-piece led to the most significant increase in particles. Combined use of the 3-in-1 air water syringe did not result in any detectable increase in the aerosol levels. Conclusions: Particulate matter was released during orthodontic debonding, although the concentration and volume was markedly less than that associated with the use of a fast hand-piece. No increase in particulates was associated with prolonged use of a 3-in-1 air-water syringe. Particulate levels reduced to baseline levels over a short period (approx. 5 minutes).

The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, a correlation and autocorrelation analysis of the observational data was carried out, the periodicity in the time- series of [C] were revealed, the calculation of the interval prediction values of [C] taking into account the periodicity in the time-series of observations from August 1 to 31, 2020 (ARM, AZE) and from August 1 to September 11, 2020 (WLD, GEO, TUR, RUS) were carried out. Comparison of real and calculated predictions data on [C] in the study sites from August 1 to August 31, 2020 is carried out.

482,On the reliability of predictions on Covid-19 dynamics: a systematic and critical review of modelling techniques,"Since the beginning of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV disease (Covid-19) in December 2019, there has been an exponential number of studies using diverse modelling techniques to assess the dynamics of transmission of the disease, predict its future course and determine the impact of different control measures. In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st 2020 to June 30th 2020. We further examined the reliability and correctness of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths. From an initial 2170 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 148 were fully analyzed. We found that most studies on the modelling of Covid-19 were from Asia (52.70%) and Europe (25%). Most of them used compartmental models (SIR and SEIR) (57%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (28%) while few used artificial intelligence (5%) and Bayesian approach (3%). For cumulative cases, the ratio predicted/observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 (4.49-9.98 and 1.10-1.94, respectively) indicating cases of incorrect predictions, large uncertainty on predictions, and large variation across studies. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. However, the ratio predicted/observed values was relatively smaller for SIR models than for SEIR models, indicating that more complex models might not be more accurate for predictions. We further found that values of both ratios decreased with the number of days covered by studies, indicating that the wider the time covered by the data, the higher the correctness and accuracy of predictions. In 21.62% of studies, observed values fall within the CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted by studies. Only six of the 148 selected studies (4.05%) predicted the number of deaths. For 33.3% of these predictions, the ratio of predicted to actual number of deaths was close to 1. We also found that the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than the compartmental and the statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small size of the data. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, there should be cautious in their usage.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20192328""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20192328,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True

484,"Modeling the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 immunity waning, antigenic drifting, and population serology patterns","Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 can result from either waning immunity, a drift in the virus that escapes previously stimulated immunity, or both. The nature of such reinfection risks will affect the choice of control tactics and vaccines. We constructed an SIR transmission model of waning and drifting that can be fitted to cross-neutralization serological data. In this model, waning occurs in individuals who have recovered from previous infections while drifting occurs during transmission to a previously infected individual. Interactions at the population level generate complex dynamics that cause drifting to occur in unanticipated but explainable ways across waning and drifting parameter sets. In particular, raising the fraction of transmissions where drifting occurs slows the rise of drifted strains to high levels and changes the equilibrium distribution of strains from {cup} shaped (extreme strains dominate) to {cap} shaped (central strains dominate). In {cup} shaped parameter regimes, endemic infection levels can rise after many years to above the original epidemic peak. The model simulates results from cross-neutralization assays given sera from previously infected individuals when multiple drifted strains are used in the assays. Fitting the model to such assay data can estimate waning and drifting parameters. Given the parameters, the model predicts infection patterns. We propose a process for using fits of our model to serological and other data called Decision Robustness and Identifiability Analysis (DRIA). This can inform decisions about vaccine options such as whether to prepare for changes in vaccine composition because the virus is changing to escape immunity.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20192153""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20192153,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True

486,Estimating the global reduction in transmission and rise in detection capacity of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020,"To better control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is essential to quantify the impact of control measures and the fraction of infected individuals that are detected. To this end we developed a deterministic transmission model based on the renewal equation and fitted the model to daily case and death data in the first few months of 2020 in 79 countries and states, representing 4.2 billions individuals. Based on a region-specific infection fatality ratio, we inferred the time-varying probability of case detection and the time-varying decline in transmissiblity. As a validation, the predicted total number of infected was close to that found in serosurveys; more importantly, the inferred probability of detection strongly correlated with the number of daily tests per inhabitant, with 50% detection achieved with 0.003 daily tests per inhabitants. Most of the decline in transmission was explained by the reductions in transmissibility (social distancing), which avoided 10 millions deaths in the regions studied over the first four months of 2020. In contrast, symptom-based testing and isolation of positive cases was not an efficient way to control the spread of the disease, as a large part of transmission happens before symptoms and only a small fraction of infected individuals was typically detected. The latter is explained by the limited number of tests available, and the fact that increasing test capacity increases the probability of detection less than proportionally. Together these results suggest that little control can be achieved by symptom-based testing and isolation alone.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20192120""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20192120,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True

488,Spatial and temporal trends in social vulnerability and COVID-19 incidence and death rates in the United States,"Background: Emerging evidence suggests that socially vulnerable communities are at higher risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in the United States. However, no prior studies have examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability and to quantify disparities in these trends over time. We hypothesized that highly vulnerable counties would have higher incidence and death rates compared to less vulnerable counties and that this disparity would widen as the pandemic progressed. Methods: We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 to August 31, 2020 for each county in the US. We obtained daily COVID-19 incident case and death data from USAFacts and the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which higher scores represent more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles. We adjusted for percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage of adult smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, and the proportion tested for COVID-19 in the state. Results: In unadjusted analyses, we found that for most of March 2020, counties in the upper SVI quartile had significantly fewer cases per 100,000 than lower SVI quartile counties. However, on March 30, we observed a crossover effect in which the RR became significantly greater than 1.00 (RR = 1.10, 95% PI: 1.03, 1.18), indicating that the most vulnerable counties had, on average, higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to least vulnerable counties. Upper SVI quartile counties had higher death rates on average starting on March 30 (RR = 1.17, 95% PI: 1.01,1.36). The death rate RR achieved a maximum value on July 29 (RR = 3.22, 95% PI: 2.91, 3.58), indicating that most vulnerable counties had, on average, 3.22 times more deaths per million than the least vulnerable counties. However, by late August, the lower quartile started to catch up to the upper quartile. In adjusted models, the RRs were attenuated for both incidence cases and deaths, indicating that the adjustment variables partially explained the associations. We also found positive associations between COVID-19 cases and deaths and percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage of resident in fair or poor health, and average daily PM2.5. Conclusions: Results indicate that the impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties over time.

Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics, and plausible control measures. Results: When no control interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in our case study destination country (New Zealand; NZ) was estimated to occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1000 population per week, a crew of 20, a voyage length of 10 days, 1 day of shore leave both in NZ and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combined use of a PCR test on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing, and mask use during shore leave, increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks even with crews of only 5 members. Conclusion: Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages.

Here we showed that patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) have a higher expression of ACE2 in BE tissues compared to normal squamous esophagus, and that the lower pH associated with BE may drive this increase in expression. Human primary monocytes cultured in reduced pH displayed increased ACE2 expression and viral load upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also showed in two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients that previous use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with 2- to 3-fold higher risk of death compared to those not using the drugs.

Findings COVID-19Predict produces 2,100 daily predictions [or calculations] on the state level (50 States x3 models x7 days x2 cases and deaths) and 131,964 (3,142 Counties x3 models x7 days x2 cases and deaths) on the county level. To assess how robust our models have performed in making short-term predictions over the course of the pandemic, we used available case data for all 50 U.S. states spanning the period January 20 - August 16 2020 in a retrospective analysis. Results showed a 3.7% to -0.2% mean error of deviation from the actual case predictions to date.

492,The impact of asthma on mental health & wellbeing during COVID-19 lockdown,"Abstract Introduction The global SARS CoV2 pandemic resulted in social isolation measures with unintended negative impacts, particularly on mental health. We hypothesised that people with asthma are likely to be more vulnerable to worse mental health during lockdown. Methods We examined COVID-19 surveys (completed April/May 2020), nested within two generations of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC): index-generation ALSPAC-G1 (n= 2942, mean age=28) and the parents generation ALSPAC-G0 (n=3737, mean age=59). We used Poisson and logistic regression models to estimate the effect of asthma on wellbeing, anxiety and depression, and factors related to COVID-19 and lockdown. Models were adjusted for validated pre-pandemic measures of mental health and socio-economic factors. Results Asthma was associated with a 13% increase in depression score in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and 15% increase in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.05) compared to participants without asthma, anxiety scores increased by 14% in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and by 16% in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.02). Asthma was associated with a similar increase of anxiety and depression scores during COVID-19 in both generations (Z test p values >0.80). Discussion People with asthma have worse mental health & wellbeing during lockdown compared to people without asthma. Although the effect of asthma on mental health is of similar magnitude between the generations, younger participants with asthma declined to lower levels of mental health despite reporting less symptoms, COVID-19 infection and self-isolation. This has important implications given repeated lockdowns. Young people with asthma should be closely monitored and supported to mitigate the impact of lockdown on their mental health.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20190793""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20190793,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
493,"Increased prolonged sitting in rheumatoid arthritis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: a within-subjects, accelerometer-based study","Background: Social distancing measures designed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic can explicitly and implicitly restrict physical activity, a particular concern for high-risk patient groups. Using a within-subjects design with objective measurement (via validated accelerometers), we assessed rheumatoid arthritis patients' physical activity and sedentary behavior levels prior to and during the social distancing measures implemented in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Post-menopausal women diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were assessed before (from March 2018 to March 2020) and during (from 24th May to 7th July 2020) social distancing measures to contain COVID-19 pandemic, using a within-subjects, repeated-measure design. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed using postural-based accelerometry (ActivPAL micro). Findings: Mean age was 60.9 years (95%CI: 58.0, 63.7) and BMI was 29.5 Kg/m2 (95%CI: 27.2, 31.9). Disease activity ranged from remission to moderate activity. Most of the patients were using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and prednisone. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent comorbidities During social distancing, there were reductions in total stepping time (15.7% [-0.3 h/day, 95%CI: -0.4, -0.1; p=0.004]), in light-intensity activity (13.0% [-0.2 h/day, 95%CI: -0.4, -0.04; p=0.016]) and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (38.8% [-4.5 min/day, 95%CI: -8.1, -0.9; p=0.015]), but no changes in total standing time or total sedentary time. However, time spent in prolonged bouts of sitting <30 min increased by 34% (1.0 h/day, 95%CI: 0.3, 1.7; p=0.006) and sitting bouts <60 min increased by 85% (1.0 h/day, 95%CI: 0.5, 1.6) Sit-stand transitions were reduced by 10% (-5.1/day, 95%CI: -10.3, 0.0; p=0.051). Conclusion: Imposed social distancing measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were associated with decreased physical activity and increased prolonged sitting among rheumatoid arthritis patients. Since this has the potential to increase the burden of cardiovascular disease in such high-risk patients, attention to maintaining physical activity is an urgent consideration during the pandemic.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith; Dominik Schulz; Ulrich Mayr; Jochen Schneider; Christoph Spinner; Fabian Geisler; Roland M.

494,The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on emergency and elective hip surgeries in Norway,"Objective: To assess the effects of Covid-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries, and explore whether these procedures are more/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care. Methods: In 1.344.355 persons aged [&ge;]35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having 1) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures, and 2) electively planned surgeries due to hip osteoarthritis before and after Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13th 2020, for different age and sex groups. Incidence Rate Ratios [IRR] reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries. Results: After-lockdown elective hip surgeries were one third the number of before-lockdown (IRR ~0.3), which is a greater drop than the drop seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR ~0.6) (no age/sex differences). Men aged 35-69 had half the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries (IRR ~0.6), whereas women aged [&ge;]70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR ~1). Only women aged 35-69 and men aged [&ge;]70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR ~0.80) Conclusion: Important to note for future pandemics management is that lockdown restrictions may impact more on scheduled joint surgery than other scheduled hospital care. Lockdown may also impact on the number of emergency joint surgeries for men aged [&ge;]35 but not for women aged [&ge;]70.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20191734""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20191734,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
495,Use of Unofficial Newspaper Data for COVID-19 Death Surveillance,"Objective. To highlight the critical importance of unofficially reported newspaper-based deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) like illness (CLI) together with officially confirmed death counts to support improvements in COVID 19 death surveillance. Methods. Both hospital-based official COVID 19 and unofficial CLI death counts were collected from daily newspapers between March 8 and August 22, 2020. We performed both exploratory and time-series analyses to understand the influence of combining newspaper-based CLI death counts with confirmed hospital death counts on the trends and forecasting of COVID-19 death counts. An autoregressive integrated moving average based approach was used to forecast the number of weekly death counts for six weeks ahead. Results. Between March 8 and August 22, 2020, 2,156 CLI deaths were recorded based on newspaper reporting for a count that was 55% of the officially confirmed death count (n = 3,907). This shows that newspaper reports tend to cover a significant number of COVID-19 related deaths. Our forecast also indicates an approximate total of 406 CLI expected for the six weeks ahead, which could contribute to a total of 2,413 deaths including 2,007 confirmed deaths expected from August 23 to October 3, 2020. Conclusions. Analyzing existing trends in and forecasting the expected number of newspaper based CLI deaths indicates yet-unreported COVID-19 death counts, which could be a critical source to estimate provisional COVID 19 death counts and mortality surveillance. Public Health Implications. Considering unofficial newspaper-based CLI death counts is essential to identify COVID-19 death severity and surveillance needs to advance public health research efforts to prepare appropriate response strategies for low- and middle-income countries.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.09.20191569""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.09.20191569,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
496,Gender disparities in access to care for time-sensitive conditions during COVID-19 pandemic in Chile,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic reduction on the utilisation of healthcare services are reported in different contexts. Nevertheless, studies have not explored specifically gender disparities on access to healthcare. Aim: To evaluate disparities in access to care in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic from a gender-based perspective. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental design using a difference-in-difference approach. We compared the number of weekly confirmed cases of a set of oncologic and cardiovascular time-sensitive conditions at a national level. We defined weeks 12 to 26 as an intervention period and the actual year as a treatment group. We selected this period because preventive interventions, such as school closures or teleworking, were implemented at this point. To test heterogeneity by sex, we included an interaction term between difference-in-difference estimator and sex. Results: A sizable reduction in access to care for patients with time-sensitivity conditions was observed for oncologic (IRR 0.56; 95% CI 0.50-0.63) and cardiovascular diseases (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.66). Greater reduction occurred in women compared to men across diseases groups, particularly marked on myocardial infarction (0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.93), stroke (IRR 0.88 IC95% 0.82-0.93), and colorectal cancer (IRR 0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.91). Compared to men, a greater absolute reduction in women for oncologic diseases (782; 95% CI 704-859) than cardiovascular diseases (172; 95% CI 170-174) occurred over 14 weeks. Conclusion: We confirmed a large drop in new diagnosis for time-sensitive conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. This reduction was greater for women. Our findings should alert policy-makers about the urgent need to integrate a gender perspective into the pandemic response and its aftermath.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20192880""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20192880,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
497,Hyaluronan is abundant in COVID-19 respiratory secretions,"COVID-19 respiratory infections are associated with copious, adherent respiratory secretions that prolong chronic ventilation and contribute to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease. We hypothesized that hyaluronan, an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan produced at sites of active inflammation that promotes edema in other settings, might be a component of these secretions. To interrogate this, we examined the respiratory secretions collected from eight intubated patients with COVID-19, six control patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a different respiratory disease also associated with thick adherent secretions, and eight healthy controls. In this sample set we found that hyaluronan content is increased approximately 20-fold in both CF and COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. The hyaluronan in COVID-19 samples was comprised of low-molecular weight fragments, the hyaluronan form most strongly linked with pro-inflammatory functions. Hyaluronan is similarly abundant in histologic sections from cadaveric lung tissue from COVID-19 patients. These findings implicate hyaluronan in the thick respiratory secretions characteristic of COVID-19 infection. Therapeutic strategies targeting hyaluronan should be investigated further for potential use in patients with COVID-19.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith; Dominik Schulz; Ulrich Mayr; Jochen Schneider; Christoph Spinner; Fabian Geisler; Roland M.

498,Resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in England: detection by community antigen surveillance,"Background Based on cases and deaths, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in England peaked in late March and early April 2020 and then declined until the end of June. Since the start of July, cases have increased, while deaths have continued to decrease. Methods We report results from 594,000 swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained from a representative sample of people in England over four rounds collected regardless of symptoms, starting in May 2020 and finishing at the beginning of September 2020. Swabs for the most recent two rounds were taken between 24th July and 11th August and for round 4 between 22nd August and 7th September. We estimate weighted overall prevalence, doubling times between and within rounds and associated reproduction numbers. We obtained unweighted prevalence estimates by sub-groups: age, sex, region, ethnicity, key worker status, household size, for which we also estimated odds of infection. We identified clusters of swab-positive participants who were closer, on average, to other swab-positive participants than would be expected. Findings Over all four rounds of the study, we found that 72% (67%, 76%) of swab-positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of swab and in the week prior. The epidemic declined between rounds 1 and 2, and rounds 2 and 3. However, the epidemic was increasing between rounds 3 and 4, with a doubling time of 17 (13, 23) days corresponding to an R value of 1.3 (1.2, 1.4). When analysing round 3 alone, we found that the epidemic had started to grow again with 93% probability. Using only the most recent round 4 data, we estimated a doubling time of 7.7 (5.5, 12.7) days, corresponding to an R value of 1.7 (1.4, 2.0). Cycle threshold values were lower (viral loads were higher) for rounds 1 and 4 than they were for rounds 2 and 3. In round 4, we observed the highest prevalence in participants aged 18 to 24 years at 0.25% (0.16%, 0.41%), increasing from 0.08% (0.04%, 0.18%) in round 3. We observed the lowest prevalence in those aged 65 and older at 0.04% (0.02%, 0.06%) which was stable compared with round 3. Participants of Asian ethnicity had elevated odds of infection. We identified clusters in and around London, transient clusters in the Midlands, and an expanding area of clustering in the North West and more recently in Yorkshire and the Humber. Interpretation Although low levels of transmission persisted in England through to mid-summer 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is now increasing. We found evidence of accelerating transmission at the end of August and beginning of September. Representative community antigen sampling can increase situational awareness and help improve public health decision making even at low prevalence.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith; Dominik Schulz; Ulrich Mayr; Jochen Schneider; Christoph Spinner; Fabian Geisler; Roland M.

499,Bacterial pulmonary superinfections are associated with unfavourable outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Objectives While superinfections are associated with unfavourable disease course, their impact on clinical outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the burden of superinfections in COVID-19 patients. Methods In this prospective single centre cohort study in an intensive care setting patients aged [&ge;] 18 years with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome were assessed for concomitant microbial infections by longitudinal analysis of tracheobronchial secretions, bronchoalveolar lavages and blood. Our primary outcome was ventilator-free survival on day 28 in patients with and without clinically relevant superinfection. Further outcomes included the association of superinfection with ICU length of stay, incidence of bacteremia, viral reactivations, and fungal colonization. Results In 45 critically ill COVID-19 patients, we identified 19 patients with superinfections (42.2%) by longitudinal analysis of 433 TBS, 35 BAL and 455 blood samples, respectively. On average, superinfections were detected on day 10 after ICU admission. The most frequently isolated clinically relevant bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ventilator-free survival was substantially lower in patients with superinfection (subhazard ratio 0.37, 95%-CI 0.15-0.90, p=0.028). Patients with pulmonary superinfections more often had bacteraemia, virus reactivations, yeast colonization, and needed ICU treatment for a significantly longer time. Conclusions The detection of superinfections was frequent and associated with reduced ventilator-free survival. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy, superinfections lead to an extended ICU stay in COVID 19 patients. Longitudinal microbiological sampling in COVID-19 patients could allow targeted antimicrobial therapy, and therefore minimize the use of broad-spectrum and reserve antibiotics.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith; Dominik Schulz; Ulrich Mayr; Jochen Schneider; Christoph Spinner; Fabian Geisler; Roland M.

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we followed 3,086 COVID-19 patients hospitalized on or before April 13, 2020 within an academic health system in New York (The Mount Sinai Health System) until June 2, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The analysis was stratified by self-reported race and ethnicity. Findings: A total of 3,086 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, of whom 680 were excluded (78 due to missing race or ethnicity data, 144 were Asian, and 458 were of other unspecified race/ethnicity). Of the 2,406 patients included, 892 (37.1%) were Hispanic, 825 (34.3%) were black, and 689 (28.6%) were white. Black and Hispanic patients were younger than White patients (median age 67 and 63 vs. 73, p<0.001 for both), and they had different comorbidity profiles. Older age and baseline hypoxia were associated with increased mortality across all races. There were suggestive but non-significant interactions between Black race and diabetes (p=0.09), and obesity (p=0.10). Among inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 mortality, there was a significant interaction between Black race and interleukin-1-beta (p=0.04), and a suggestive interactions between Hispanic ethnicity and procalcitonin (p=0.07) and interleukin-8 (p=0.09).

501,Mitochondrial induced T cell apoptosis and aberrant myeloid metabolic programs define distinct immune cell subsets during acute and recovered SARS-CoV-2 infection,"By interrogating metabolic programs in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of acutely infected COVID-19 patients, we identified novel and distinct immune cell subsets Our studies identified a non-clonal population of T cells expressing high H3K27me3 and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to cell death. Characterized by dysmorphic mitochondria and increased cytoplasmic cytochrome c, apoptosis of these cells was inhibited by preventing VDAC aggregation or blocking caspase activation. Further, we observed a marked increase in Hexokinase II+ polymorphonuclear-myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC). While PMN-MDSC were also found in the PBMC of patients with other viral infections, the Hexokinase II+ PMN-MDSC were found exclusively in the acute COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe disease. Finally, we identified a population of monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) expressing high carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1a) and VDAC, which were present in the PBMC of the acute COVID-19 patients, but not recovered COVID-19 patients and whose presence correlated with severity of disease.

Regions with a higher proportion of people wearing masks show better control of COVID-19, but the effectiveness of masks is still under debate due to their limited and variable efficiencies in removing respiratory particles. Here, we analyze experimental data and perform model calculations to show that this contrast can be explained by the different abundance regimes between particles and viruses. Upon short-term exposure, respiratory particles are usually in a particle-rich regime, but respiratory viruses are often in a virus-limited regime where the numbers of viruses inhaled by susceptible people are below or close to the infectious dose.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our hospital's current nosocomial infection control, we conducted a serological survey of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (immunoglobulin G) among the staff of our hospital, which is treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G in the participants using a laboratory-based quantitative test (Abbott immunoassay), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99.6%, respectively. To investigate the factors associated with seropositivity, we also obtained some information from the participants with an anonymous questionnaire. Results: We invited 1133 staff members in our hospital, and 925 (82%) participated. The mean age of the participants was 40.0{+/-}11.8 years, and most were women (80.0%). According to job title, there were 149 medical doctors or dentists (16.0%), 489 nurses (52.9%), 140 medical technologists (14.2%), 49 healthcare providers (5.3%), and 98 administrative staff (10.5%). The overall prevalence of seropositivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.43% (4/925), which was similar to the control seroprevalence of 0.54% (16/2970)) in the general population in Osaka during the same period according to a government survey conducted with the same assay. Seropositive rates did not significantly differ according to job title, exposure to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, or any other investigated factors.

Total all-cause mortality in excess to average all-cause mortality during the epidemic peak period may provide a comprehensive picture of the total burden of COVID19-related deaths.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20191965""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20191965,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
507,SARS-CoV-2 detection by extraction-free qRT-PCR for massive and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis during a pandemic,"COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the healthcare and economy on a global scale. It is widely recognized that mass testing is an efficient way to contain the infection spread as well as the development of informed policies for disease management. However, the current COVID-19 worldwide infection rates increased demand in the rapid and reliable screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared the performance of qRT-PCR in direct heat-inactivated, heat-inactivated/pelleted samples against RNA in a group of 74 subjects (44 positive and 30 negative). In addition, we compared the sensitivity of heat-inactivated/pelleted in another group of 196 COVID-19 positive samples. Our study suggests that swab sample heat-inactivation and pelleting show higher accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection PCR assay compared to heat-inactivation only (89% vs 83% of the detection in RNA). The accuracy of detection using direct samples varied depending on the sample transport and storage media as well as the viral titer. Our study suggests that purified RNA provides more accurate results, however, direct qRT-PCR may help to significantly increase testing capacity. Switching to the direct sample testing is justified if the number of tests is doubled at least.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith; Dominik Schulz; Ulrich Mayr; Jochen Schneider; Christoph Spinner; Fabian Geisler; Roland M.

508,Increased extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) reflects rapid inflammatory oedema and mortality in COVID-19 associated ARDS,"OBJECTIVE: Nearly 5 % of the patients with COVID-19 develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of pulmonary oedema which is associated with mortality in ARDS. In this study we evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as compared to controls and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease progression. METHODS: From the day of intubation, EVLWI, cardiac function were monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution in n=25 patients with COVID-19 and compared to a control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS-patients. RESULTS: EVLWI in COVID-19-patients was noticeably elevated and significantly higher than in the control group (17 (11-38) vs. 11 (6-26) mL/kg; p<0.001). High pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0-5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0-5.2); p=0.003) suggest inflammatory oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI, GEF and GEDVI were comparable. High EVLWI values were associated with viral persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and mortality (23.2{+/-}6.7% vs. 30.3{+/-}6.0%, p=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the control group, COVID-19 results in markedly elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 associated ARDS and could serve as parameter to monitor ARDS progression.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith; Dominik Schulz; Ulrich Mayr; Jochen Schneider; Christoph Spinner; Fabian Geisler; Roland M.

509,Evaluating the effects of cardiometabolic exposures on circulating proteins which may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 severity,"Background: Developing insight into the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of critical importance to overcome the global pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence SARS-CoV-2 severity. Findings: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyses. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P=2.19x10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P=9.04x10-12). Further analyses using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protecting the body from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P=2.32x10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence SARS-CoV-2 severity was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P=0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in the bodys inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples. Interpretation: Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease. Future research to determine whether these circulating proteins mediate environmental effects onto risk of SARS-CoV-2 are warranted to help elucidate therapeutic strategies for covid-19 disease severity.",Tom G Richardson; Si Fang; Ruth E Mitchell; Michael V Holmes; George Davey Smith,"https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20191932""",https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.10.20191932,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
