0,Identifying common pharmacotherapies associated with reduced COVID-19 morbidity using electronic health records,"Importance: Absent a vaccine or any established treatments for the novel and highly infectious coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), rapid efforts to identify potential therapeutics are required. Objective: To identify commonly-prescribed medications that may be associated with lesser risk of morbidity with COVID-19 across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using electronic health records between 7/1/2019 and 4/07/2020. Setting: Outpatient, emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals. Participants: All individuals presenting to a clinical site and undergoing COVID-19 testing. Main Outcome or Measure: Inpatient hospitalization; documented requirement for mechanical ventilation. Results: Among 12,818 individuals with COVID-19 testing results available, 2271 (17.7%) were test-positive, and 707/2271 (31.1%) were hospitalized in one of 5 hospitals. Based on a comparison of ranked electronic prescribing frequencies, medications enriched among test-positive individuals not requiring hospitalization included ibuprofen, valacyclovir, and naproxen. Among individuals who were hospitalized, mechanical ventilation was documented in 213 (30.1%); ibuprofen and naproxen were also more commonly prescribed among individuals not requiring ventilation. Conclusions and Relevance: These preliminary findings suggest that electronic health records may be applied to identify medications associated with lower risk of morbidity with COVID-19, but larger cohorts will be required to address confounding by indication. Larger scale efforts at repositioning may help to identify FDA-approved medications meriting study for prevention of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","Castro, V. M.; Ross, R. A.; McBride, S.

1,"Characteristics and outcomes of a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 patients in the Province of Reggio Emilia, Italy","Objectives. To describe the age- and sex-specific prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) and its prognostic factors. Design. Population-based prospective cohort study on archive data. Setting. Preventive services and hospital care in the province of Reggio Emilia, Northern Italy. Participants. All 2653 symptomatic patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from February 27 to April 2, 2020 in the province of Reggio Emilia. Main outcome measures. Hospitalization and death up to April 2, 2020. Results. Females had higher prevalence of infection than males below age 50 (2.61 vs. 1.84 per 1000), but lower in older ages (16.49 vs. 20.86 per 1000 over age 80). Case fatality rate reached 20.7% (22/106) in cases with more than 4 weeks follow up. After adjusting for age and comorbidities, men had a higher risk of hospitalization (hazard ratio (HR) 1.4 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.2 to 1.6) and of death (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1). Patients over age 80 compared to < age 50 had HR 7.1 (95% CI 5.4 to 9.3) and HR 27.8 (95% CI 12.5 to 61.7) for hospitalization and death, respectively. Immigrants had a higher risk of hospitalization (HR 1.3, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.81) than Italians and a similar risk of death. Risk of hospitalization and of death were higher in patients with heart failure (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1and HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2, respectively), arrhythmia (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.5, respectively), dementia (HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.8 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8, respectively), ischemic heart disease (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.7 and HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.5, respectively), diabetes (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9 and HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2, respectively), and hypertensions(HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.6 and HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1, respectively), while COPD increased the risk of hospitalization (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.5) but not of death (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7). Previous use of ACE inhibitors has no effect on risk of death (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.34) Conclusions. The mechanisms underlying these associations are mostly unknown. A deeper understanding of the causal chain from infection, disease onset, and immune response to outcomes may explain how these prognostic factors act.","Giorgi Rossi, P.; Marino, M.; Formisano, D.; Venturelli, F.; Vicentini, M.; Grilli, R.; The Reggio Emilia COVID-19 Working Group,","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063545v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063545v1?rss=1,2020-04-16,2020-04-16,,True
2,Cardiovascular Diseases and COVID-19 Mortality and Intensive Care Unit Admission: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Importance: On 11th March, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic of COVID-19. There are over 1 million cases around the world with this disease and it continues to raise. Studies on COVID-19 patients have reported high rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among them and patients with CVD had higher mortality rate. Objectives: Since there were controversies between different studies about CVD burden in COVID-19 patients, we aimed to study cardiovascular disease burden among COVID-19 patients using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources: We have systematically searched databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science as well as medRxiv pre-print database. Hand searched was also conducted in journal websites and Google Scholar. Study Selection: Studies reported cardiovascular disease among hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients with mortality or ICU admission (primary outcomes) were included into meta-analysis. In addition, all of studies which reported any cardiovascular implication were included for descriptive meta-analysis. Cohort studies, case-control, cross-sectional, case-cohort and case series studies included into the study. Finally, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria for primary outcome and 59 studies for descriptive outcome. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two investigators have independently evaluated quality of publications and extracted data from included papers. In case of disagreement a supervisor solved the issue and made the final decision. Quality assessment of studies was done using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale tool. Heterogeneity was assessed using I-squared test and in case of high heterogeneity (>%50) random effect model was used. Main Outcomes and Measures: Meta-analyses were carried out for Odds Ratio (OR) of mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission for different CVDs and Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) was calculated for Cardiac Troponin I. We have also performed a descriptive meta-analysis on different CVDs. Results: Sixteen papers including 3473 patients entered into meta-analysis for ICU admission and mortality outcome and fifty-nine papers including 9509 patients for descriptive outcomes. Results of meta-analysis indicated that acute cardiac injury, (OR: 15.94, 95% CI 2.31-110.14), hypertension (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.92-2.74), heart Failure (OR: 11.73, 95% CI 5.17-26.60), other cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.95, 95% CI 1.17-3.24) and overall CVDs (OR: 3.37, 95% CI 2.06-5.52) were significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Arrhythmia (OR: 22.17, 95%CI 4.47-110.04), acute cardiac injury (OR: 19.83, 95%CI 7.85-50.13), coronary heart disease (OR: 4.19, 95%CI 1.27-13.80), cardiovascular disease (OR: 4.17, 95%CI 2.52-6.88) and hypertension (OR: 2.69, 95%CI 1.55-4.67) were also significantly associated with ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Our findings showed a high burden of CVDs among COVID-19 patients which was significantly associated with mortality and ICU admission. Proper management of CVD patients with COVID-19 and monitoring COVID-19 patients for acute cardiac conditions is highly recommended to prevent mortality and critical situations.","Shamshirian, A.; Heydari, K.; Alizadeh-Navaei, R.; Moosazadeh, M.; Abrotan, S.; Hessami, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062869v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062869v1?rss=1,2020-04-16,2020-04-16,,True
3,COVID-19-related mortality by age groups in Europe: A meta-analysis,"Background and Objectives: To date, more than 1,000,000 confirmed cases and 65,000 deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported globally. Early data have indicated that older patients are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than younger ones, but precise international estimates of the age-breakdown of COVID-19-related deaths are lacking. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the distribution of COVID-19-related fatalities by age groups in Europe. On April 6, 2020, we systematically reviewed COVID-19-related mortality data from 32 European countries (European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom). We collated official reports provided by local Public Health or Ministry of Health websites. We included countries if they provided data regarding more than 10 COVID-19-related deaths stratified by age according to pre-specified groups (i.e., < 40, 40-69, [&ge;] 70 years). We used random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of age groups among all COVID-19-related fatalities. Results: Thirteen European countries were included in the review, for a total of 31,864 COVID-19-related deaths (range: 27-14,381 per country). In the main meta-analysis (including data from Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland; 21,522 COVID-19-related fatalities), the summary proportions of persons < 40, 40-69, and [&ge;] 70 years of age among all COVID-19-related deaths were 0.1% (0.0-0.2%; I2 24%), 12.8% (10.3-15.6%; I2 94%), and 84.8% (81.3-88.1%; I2 96%), respectively. Conclusions: People under 40 years of age represent a small fraction of the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Europe. These results may help health authorities respond to public concerns and guide future physical distancing and mitigation strategies.","Cohen, J. F.; Korevaar, D.

4,Designing a multi-epitope peptide-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted so far 14,395,16 confirmed cases with 85,711 deaths from the 212 countries, or territories. Due to multifacet issues and challenges in implementation of the safety & preventive measures, inconsistent coordination between societies-governments and most importanly lack of specific vaccine to SARS-CoV-2, the spread of Wuhan originated virus is still uprising after taking a heavy toll on human life. In the present study, we mapped several immunogenic epitopes (B-cell, T-cell, and IFN-gamma) over the entire structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and by applying various computational and immunoinformatics approaches, we designed a multi-epitope peptide based vaccine that predicted high immunogenic response in the largest proportion of world's human population. To ensure high expression of the recombinant vaccine in E. coli, codon optimization and in-silico cloning were also carried out. The designed vaccine with high molecular affinity to TLR3 and TLR4, was found capable to initiate effective innate and adaptive immune response. The immune simulation also suggested uprising high levels of both B-cell and T-cell mediated immunity which on subsequent exposure cleared antigen from the system. The proposed vaccine found promising by yielding desired results and hence, should be tested by practical experimentations for its functioning and efficacy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.","Singh, A.; Thakur, M.; Sharma, L.

5,AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODEL TO AID DECISION-MAKING FOR COVID-19 CONTROL IN SRI LANKA,"Background: Sri Lanka diagnosed the first local case of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020. The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with very stringent measures for social distancing: complete island-wide lockdown, contact tracing and isolation, and quarantine of all inbound passengers were all adopted by 20 March. In the first 30 days, Sri Lanka has had 197 cases with 7 deaths, and is now considering a staged relaxing of the lockdown. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which the reproduction number should be constrained, in order to ensure that the COVID-19 case load remains within the capacity of the health system of Sri Lanka, while the infection spreads slowly. Methods: We used publicly available data and adopted a Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R0 values after a lockout period. We considered the entire population of the country exposed, with a 14-day period of infection. We assumed 50% of the infected are symptomatic, of which 5% would require critical care, and that the maximum national capacity for treatment of such patients would be 300 beds in Intensive Care Units. Results: The cumulative case load increased exponentially during the first 8 days of the epidemic and started flattening out from day 9 in the country. In a lockout situation, if the number of infected doubles every 20 days (R=1.5), at least 300 ICU beds are likely to be required by the end of 100 days. If the number infected doubles every 14 days (R=1.7), the ICU bed capacity is likely to be exceeded in 70 days. This period is reduced to 50 days if infected cases double every 10 days (R=2.0). Conclusion: Our model suggests that the desired level of control post-lockout to ensure that the case load remains within the assumed capacity of health system lies somewhere between R=1.5 and R=1.7, where the period for doubling of total infections would be 14 - 20 days, and the number of new infections would be between 16 and 24 on Day 7, and between 20 and 34 on Day 14. This model can be refined to suit other low and middle income countries which may contemplate lockout, but have similar health resource constraints.","Ediriweera, D. S.; de Silva, N. R.; Malavige, N.

6,Impact of population mask wearing on Covid-19 post lockdown,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV2 is a rapidly spreading global pandemic. Although precise transmission routes and dynamics are unknown, SARS-CoV2 is thought primarily to spread via contagious respiratory droplets. Unlike with SARS-CoV, maximal viral shedding occurs in the early phase of illness, and this is supported by models that suggest 40-80% of transmission events occur from pre- and asymptomatic individuals. One widely-discussed strategy to limit transmission of SARS-CoV2, particularly from presymptomatic individuals, has been population-level wearing of masks. Modelling for pandemic influenza suggests some benefit in reducing total numbers infected with even 50% mask-use. COVID-19 has a higher hospitalization and mortality rate than influenza, and the impacts on these parameters, and critically, at what point in the pandemic trajectory mask-use might exert maximal benefit are completely unknown. We derived a simplified SIR model to investigate the effects of near-universal mask-use on COVID-19 assuming 8 or 16% mask efficacy. We decided to model, in particular, the impact of masks on numbers of critically-ill patients and cumulative mortality, since these are parameters that are likely to have the most severe consequences in the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas mask use had a relatively minor benefit on critical-care and mortality rates when transmissibility (Reff) was high, the reduction on deaths was dramatic as the effective R approached 1, as might be expected after aggressive social-distancing measures such as wide-spread lockdowns. One major concern with COVID-19 is its potential to overwhelm healthcare infrastructures, even in resource-rich settings, with one third of hospitalized patients requiring critical-care. We incorporated this into our model, increasing death rates for when critical-care resources have been exhausted. Our simple model shows that modest efficacy of masks could avert substantial mortality in this scenario. Importantly, the effects on mortality became hyper-sensitive to mask-wearing as the effective R approaches 1, i.e. near the tipping point of when the infection trajectory is expected to revert to exponential growth, as would be expected after effective lockdown. Our model suggests that mask-wearing might exert maximal benefit as nations plan their post-lockdown strategies and suggests that mask-wearing should be included in further more sophisticated models of the current pandemic.","Javid, B.; Balaban, N.

7,Prediction of the time evolution of the COVID-19 disease in Guadeloupe with a stochastic evolutionary model,"Predictions on the time-evolution of the number of severe and critical cases of COVID-19 patients in Guadeloupe are presented. A stochastic model is purposely developed to explicitly account for the entire population ({approx} 400000 inhabitants) of Guadeloupe. The available data for Guadeloupe are analysed and combined with general characteristics of the COVID-19 to constrain the parameters of the model. The time-evolution of the number of cases follows the well-known exponential-like model observed at the very beginning of a pandemic outbreak. The exponential growth of the number of infected individuals is controlled by the so-called basic reproductive number, R0, defined as the likely number of additional cases generated by a single infectious case during its infectious period TI. Because of the rather long duration of infectious period ({approx} 14 days) a high rate of contamination is sustained during several weeks after the beginning of the containment period. This may constitute a source of discouragement for people restrained to respect strict containment rules. It is then unlikely that, during the containment period, R0 falls to zero. Fortunately, our models shows that the containment effects are not much sensitive to the exact value of R0 provided we have R0 < 0.6. For such conditions, we show that the number of severe and critical cases is highly tempered about 4 to 6 weeks after the beginning of the containment. Also, the maximum number of critical cases (i.e. the cases that may exceed the hospital intensive care capacity) remains near 30 when R0 < 0.6. For a larger R0 = 0.8 a slower decrease of the number of critical cases occurs, leading to a larger number of deceased patients. This last example illustrates the great importance to maintain an as low as possible R0 during and after the containment period. The rather long delay between the beginning of the containment and the appearance of the slowing-down of the rate of contamination puts a particular strength on the communication and sanitary education of people. To be mostly efficient, this communication must be done by a locally recognised medical staff. We believe that this point is a crucial matter of success.","ALLALI, M.; PORTECOP, P.; CARLES, M.; GIBERT, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20063008v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20063008v1?rss=1,2020-04-16,2020-04-16,,True
8,"Incidence, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics of hospitalized 2019 coronavirus disease among 9,596,321 individuals residing in California and Washington, United States: a prospective cohort study","Background: The United States is now the country reporting the highest number of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and deaths. However, little is known about the epidemiology and burden of severe COVID-19 to inform planning within healthcare systems and modeling of intervention impact. Methods: We assessed incidence, duration of hospitalization, and clinical outcomes of acute COVID-19 inpatient admissions in a prospectively-followed cohort of 9,596,321 individuals enrolled in comprehensive, integrated healthcare delivery plans from Kaiser Permanente in California and Washington state. We also estimated the effective reproductive number (RE) describing transmission in the study populations. Results: Data covered 1277 hospitalized patients with laboratory- or clinically-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by April 9, 2020. Cumulative incidence of first COVID-19 acute inpatient admission was 10.6-12.4 per 100,000 cohort members across the study regions. Mean censoring-adjusted duration of hospitalization was 10.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 0.8-30.1) among survivors and 13.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 1.7-34.6) among non-survivors. Among all hospitalized confirmed cases, censoring-adjusted probabilities of ICU admission and mortality were 41.9% (95% confidence interval: 34.1-51.4%) and 17.8% (14.3-22.2%), respectively, and higher among men than women. We estimated RE was 1.43 (1.17-1.73), 2.09 (1.63-2.69), and 1.47 (0.07-2.59) in Northern California, Southern California, and Washington, respectively, for infections acquired March 1, 2020. RE declined to 0.98 (0.76-1.27), 0.89 (0.74-1.06), and 0.92 (0.05-1.55) respectively, for infections acquired March 20, 2020. Conclusions: We identify high probability of ICU admission, long durations of stay, and considerable mortality risk among hospitalized COVID-19 cases in the western United States.

13,Epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the Philippines,"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-2019) is a source of great concern in the Philippines. In this paper, we described the epidemiological characteristics of the laboratory-confirmed patients with Covid-2019 in the Philippines as of April 3, 2020 and provided recommendations on how to limit the spread of the disease. Data from the DOH NCOV tracker and University of the Philippines Covid-2019 tracker were extracted, from its initiation (January 30, 2020) until the most recent situation report (April 3, 2020). The total number of cases and deaths were stratified by sex, age, and region of the Philippines. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic profile of the confirmed cases. Case fatality rate, in percent, was calculated by dividing the total number of deaths to the total number of confirmed cases. Results revealed that a total of 3,018 cases of Covid-2019 spread were confirmed across 17 regions in the Philippines. These cases occurred over the course of 73 days through person-to-person transmission, highlighting an extremely high infectivity rate. The 144 deaths accounted for, equate to 4.51 case fatality rate, seemingly lower compared to its predecessors, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but higher compared to that of United States of America, Germany, mainland China, and neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Thailand. Of the 3,018 confirmed cases, majority were male, elderly, and diagnosed in Metro Manila region. Case fatality rates were higher in male and highest among elderly and Filipinos in the Ilocos region. With the surge on the number of cases, precautionary measures should remain a responsibility, and protocols for prevention need to be set. Adherence to infection control guidelines such as but not limited to frequently handwashing for at least 20 seconds, observing coughing etiquette, wearing of masks, and social distancing should be maintained in order to contain the disease.","Alipio, M.

14,Assessment of N95 respirator decontamination and re-use for SARS-CoV-2,"The unprecedented pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has created worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment, in particular respiratory protection such as N95 respirators. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is frequently occurring in hospital settings, with numerous reported cases of nosocomial transmission highlighting the vulnerability of healthcare workers. In general, N95 respirators are designed for single use prior to disposal. Here, we have analyzed four readily available and often used decontamination methods: UV, 70% ethanol, 70C heat and vaporized hydrogen peroxide for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirators. Equally important we assessed the function of the N95 respirators after multiple wear and decontamination sessions.","Fischer, R.; Morris, D.

15,Delayed-Phase Thrombocytopenia in Patients of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"The pandemic COVID19 pneumonia has engulfed the entire world. Hematopoietic system can also be affected by COVID19. Thrombocytopenia at admission was prevalent, while late phase or delayed phase thrombocytopenia is obscure. This retrospective case series analyzed patients with COVID19 at the Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 25th to March 9th, 2020. Analysis began on March 11th, 2020. COVID19 associated delayed phase thrombocytopenia was occurred in 11.8% percent of enrolled patients. The delayed phase thrombocytopenia in COVID19 is prone to develop in elderly patients or patients with low lymphocyte count on admission. The delayed-phase thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher ICU admission rate. Delayed phase nadir platelet counts demonstrated a high and significantly negative linear correlation with B cell percentages and serum IL 6 levels. We also presented bone marrow aspiration pathology of three patients with delayed phase thrombocytopenia, showing impaired maturation of megakaryocytes. We speculated that the delayed phase platelet destruction might be mediated by antibodies, and suggest immunoregulatory treatment in severe patients to improve outcomes. Besides, clinicians need to pay attention to the delayed phase thrombocytopenia especially at 3 to 4 weeks after symptom onset.","Zhou, H.; Chen, W.; Li, Z.; Yang, B.; Zhou, Q.; Wang, P.; Zhu, J.; Chen, X.; Yang, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20059170v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20059170v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,True

This global response has led to a burst of publications on the pathophysiology of the virus, yet without coordinated efforts to organize this knowledge, it can remain hidden away from individual research groups. By extracting and formalizing this knowledge in a structured and computable form, as in the form of a knowledge graph, researchers can readily reason and analyze this information on a much larger scale. Here, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph, an expansive cause-and-effect network constructed from scientific literature on the new coronavirus that aims to provide a comprehensive view of its pathophysiology. To make this resource available to the research community and facilitate its exploration and analysis, we also implemented a web application and released the KG in multiple standard formats.","Domingo-Fernandez, D.; Baksi, S.; Schultz, B.

17,The global population of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of six major subtypes,"The World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020, the second pandemic of the 21st century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Expanding virus populations, as that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for a robust clustering. Here, we proposed the subdivision of the global SARS-CoV-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes. Six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have phenotypic implications. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world, a typical founder effect. The genetic structure determined for the SARS-CoV-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs.","Morais Junior, I.

18,Rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by detecting IgG and IgM antibodies with an immunochromatographic device: a prospective single-center study,"Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 infection constitutes a diagnostic challenge in patients from 2-3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, due to the low positivity rate of the PCR, especially in upper respiratory samples. Serologic tests based on ELISA have been developed and evaluated as useful complements to PCR in these situations. However, there is scarce information about the usefulness of rapid tests based on immunochromatography. The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic performance of these rapid tests in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods: We evaluated an immunochromatographic test (AllTest COV-19 IgG / IgM kit) which detects IgG and IgM antibodies. First, we performed a validation of the serologic test using serum samples from 45 healthy control patients (group 1) and 55 confirmed by PCR cases of COVID-19 (group 2) in order to establish the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Then we prospectively employed the test in 63 patients diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown etiology that were SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR (group 3), to establish the diagnostic performance in these patients. Results: All patients from group 1 (healthy controls) resulted negative for the serologic test (specificity = 100%). Regarding group 2 (PCR positive) patients, the median time from the onset of symptoms was 11 days and the test was positive for either IgM or IgG in 26 out of 55 patients (overall sensitivity = 47.3%). However, in those patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 73.9%. Regarding group 3 patients, the median days from onset of symptoms was 17 and the test was positive in 56 out of 63 patients (88.9% positivity rate). In these group 3 patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the positivity rate was 91.1%. Conclusions: Our study shows that serologic rapid tests can be used as a complement of PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 days from the onset of symptoms. These immunochromatographic devices could be especially useful in hospitalized patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology with 14 or more days from the onset of symptoms and in whom the PCR has been negative.","Garcia, F.

19,The FDA-approved gold drug Auranofin inhibits novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) replication and attenuates inflammation in human cells,"SARS-COV-2 has recently emerged as a new public health threat. Herein, we report that the FDA-approved gold drug, auranofin, inhibits SARS-COV-2 replication in human cells at low micro molar concentration. Treatment of cells with auranofin resulted in a 95% reduction in the viral RNA at 48 hours after infection. Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells. These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated lung injury due to its anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-ROS properties. Auranofin has a well-known toxicity profile and is considered safe for human use.","Rothan, H.; Stone, S.; Natekar, J.; Kumari, P.; Arora, K.; Kumar, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041228v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041228v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,False
20,Human agency and infection rates: implications for social distancing during epidemics,"Social distancing is an important measure in controlling epidemics. This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in the social setting. The model is based on well-mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction. The theoretical model can also be applied to look at the dynamics of epidemic progression under various scenarios. The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require the switching on and off of measures and for this reason eradication is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for eradication it is not be a good mechanism on its own to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up eradication, and be a better tool for prevention of infection or reinfection.","Bronk Ramsey, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062042v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062042v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,True
21,Phylogenetic Analysis of the Novel Coronavirus Reveals Important Variants in Indian Strains,"As recently classified as a pandemic by WHO, novel Corononavirus 2019 has affected almost every corner of the globe causing human deaths in a range of hundred thousands. The virus having its roots in Wuhan (China) has been spread over the world by its own property to change itself accordingly. These changes correspond to its transmission and pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture. In this paper, a few findings from the whole genome sequence analysis of viral genome sequences submitted from India are presented. The data used for analysis comprises 440 collective genome sequences of virus submitted in GenBank, GISAID, and SRA projects, from around the world as well as 28 viral sequences from India. Multiple sequence alignment of all genome sequences was performed and analysed. A novel non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 Indian strains is reported along with other frequent and important changes from around the world: 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G. The novel change was observed in samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples collected in January with the respective persons travel history to China. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut. A second patient in the world to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains. This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype. Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being emergent clade of Iran. Its important to observe the changes in NSP3 gene, as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection as well as potential drug target. Extensive Positive Selection Drives the Evolution of Nonstructural Proteins. With the limited number of sequences this was the only frequent novel non-synonymous change observed from Indian strains, thereby making this change vulnerable for investigation in future. This paper has a special focus on tracking of Indian viral sequences submitted in public domain.","Joshi, A.; Paul, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041301v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041301v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,False
22,Estimating the real-time case fatality rate of COVID-19 using Poisson mixtures model,"Importance: The case fatality rate (CFR) estimation during the early stage of a disease outbreak is important, but the current estimation methods are heavily biased. Objective: We proposed using a Poisson mixtures model that utilized requires data of deaths, recoveries, and total confirmed cases recorded in each day since the outbreak of a population. Design: We collected data of deaths, recoveries, and total confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China, and other parts of China up to 10th April 2020. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The CFR of COVID-19 was estimated by minimizing the chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic. Results: Our proposed CRF estimates for Hubei Province became stable on 5th February in the range of 4.5% to 7.0% at which the simple CFR estimators overestimated the actual CFR by more than five folds, and that for the other parts of China (1.5% to 1.6%) were all very close to the actual CFR on the first day of CFR estimation (25th January) at which the simple CFRs were in the range between 15% and 35%. Conclusions and Relevance: Our CFR estimates for Hubei Province and other parts of China were superior to the simple CFR estimators.","Lee, P.

23,Epidemiological investigation and intergenerational clinical characteristics of 24 COVID-19 patients associated with supermarket cluster,"Objective: To analyze the epidemiological and intergenerational clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with cluster, so as to understand the rules of the patients associated with cluster of this outbreak and provide help for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Methods: All close contacts of the patient were screened since the first supermarket employee with COVID-19 was identified. A retrospective analysis was made on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the confirmed cases admitted to the designated hospitals for centralized treatment. The patients were divided into two groups according to the first generation (supermarket employees, group A) and the second or third generation (family members or friends of supermarket employees, group B), and the similarities and differences between the two groups were compared. Results: A total of 24 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed, with an average age of 48{+/-}1.73 years. The mean duration from onset to release form quarantine was 21.04{+/-}6.77 days, and the onset time was concentrated in 5-11 days after the first patient was diagnosed. Among all the patients, 23 patients were moderate, among which 7 patients (29.17%) were asymptomatic. Symptoms of symptomatic patients were cough (75.00%), low fever (62.50%), shortness of breath (41.67%), sore throat (25.00%), gastrointestinal symptoms (25.00%), fatigue (20.83%), etc. Biochemical examination on admission showed that the white blood cell count < 4.010x9/L (29.17%) and the lymphocyte count <1.1x109/L (58.33%). The lymphocyte count of 50.00% of the patients was [&le;]0.6x109/L. On admission, chest CT showed pneumonia (100%) with bilateral infiltration (75.00%). Treatment: antiviral drug (100%), Chinese medicine (100%), common oxygen therapy (45.83%). There were 11 cases in group A (first generation, 11 cases) and 13 cases in group B (second generation, 11 cases; third generation, 2 cases). In group B, there were more males, from onset to admission later, more patients had underlying diseases, and more patients were treated with albumin (P<0.05). However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in other clinical indicators, including the duration from onset to release form quarantine(P>0.05). There was no improvement in granulocyte count in all patients, as well as in groups A and B, between admission and release from quarantine(P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with cluster were similar to those of other COVID-19 patients, but there were some special features. The severity of the disease was similar and there was intergenerational spread. There was no difference in clinical characteristics between generations. Asymptomatic infections occurred in a proportion of patients and could cause spread.","Tian, S.; Wu, M.; Chang, Z.; Wang, Y.; Zhou, G.; Zhang, W.; Xing, J.; Tian, H.; Zhang, X.; Zou, X.; Zhang, L.; Liu, M.; Chen, J.; Han, J.; Ning, K.; Chen, S.; Wu, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20058891v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20058891v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,True

25,The clinical characteristics and mortal causes analysis of COVID-19 death patients,"Abstract Purpose: Currently, COVID-19 is causing a large number of deaths globally. However, few researches focused on the clinical features of death patients. This study conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics and mortal causes in Chinese COVID-19 death patients. Patients and methods: The clinical characteristics of death patients were collected from publicized by local health authorities in China. Expressions of virus targets in human organs were obtained from GTEx database. Results: 159 patients from 24 provinces in China were recruited in our study, including 26 young patients under 60 and 133 aged 60 or older. The median age was 71 years, which indicated that most death patients were elderly. More male patients died of COVID-19 than females (1.65 fold). Hypertension was the most common coexisting disorder and respiratory failure was the most common direct cause of death. Fever (71.19%) and cough (55.08%) were the predominant presenting symptoms. There was one asymptomatic patient. In addition, by comparing young and old patients, heart disease was identified as an important risk factor for death in the aged patients. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were the targets of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed their expression in different organs. TMPRSS2 and ACE2 had a high expression in the organs which had corresponding clinical features in death patients. Conclusion: Male, age and heart disease were the main risk factors of death. Beside, asymptomatic patients with serious coexisting disorders may also die of SARS-CoV-2.

26,Genome based Evolutionary study of SARS-CoV-2 towards the Prediction of Epitope Based Chimeric Vaccine,"SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems of human and has already become an unprecedented threat to global healthcare system. COVID-19, the most serious public condition caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads the world to an uncertainty alongside thousands of regular death scenes. Unavailability of specific therapeutics or approved vaccine has made the recovery of COVI-19 more troublesome and challenging. The present in silico study aimed to predict a novel chimeric vaccines by simultaneously targeting four major structural proteins via the establishment of ancestral relationship among different strains of coronaviruses. Conserved regions from the homologous protein sets of spike glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) were identified through multiple sequence alignment. The phylogeny analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins (S, E, M and N) reflected the close ancestral relation of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-COV-1 and bat coronavirus. Numerous immunogenic epitopes (both T cell and B cell) were generated from the common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigenicity, transmembrane topology, conservancy level, toxicity and allergenicity pattern and population coverage analysis. Top putative epitopes were combined with appropriate adjuvants and linkers to construct a novel multiepitope subunit vaccine against COVID-19. The designed constructs were characterized based on physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity and solubility which revealed the superiority of construct V3 in terms safety and efficacy. Essential molecular dynamics and Normal Mode analysis confirmed minimal deformability of the refined model at molecular level. In addition, disulfide engineering was investigated to accelerate the stability of the protein. Molecular docking study ensured high binding affinity between construct V3 and HLA cells, as well as with different host receptors. Microbial expression and translational efficacy of the constructs were checked using pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12. The development of preventive measures to combat COVID-19 infections might be aided the present study. However, the in vivo and in vitro validation might be ensured with wet lab trials using model animals for the implementation of the presented data.","Akhand, M. R. N.; Azim, K. F.; Hoque, S.

27,Household Secondary Attack Rate of COVID-19 and Associated Determinants,"Background: As of April 2, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases has crossed over 1 million with more than 55,000 deaths. The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive. Methods: Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period. Results: A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly ([&ge;]60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51-0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly [&ge;]60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.","Jing, Q.-L.; Liu, M.-J.; Yuan, J.; Zhang, Z.-B.; Zhang, A.-R.; Dean, N.

These sdAbs revealed binding kinetics with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 0.7-33 nM. The monomeric sdAbs showed half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.003-0.3 ug/mL in pseudotyped particle neutralization assay, and 0.23-0.50 ug/mL in authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Competitive ligand-binding data suggested that the sdAbs either completely blocked or significantly inhibited the association between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and viral entry receptor ACE2. Finally, we showed that fusion of the human IgG1 Fc to sdAbs improved their neutralization activity by tens of times. These results reveal the novel SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeting sdAbs and pave a road for antibody drug development.","Chi, X.; Liu, X.; Wang, C.; Zhang, X.; Ren, L.; Jin, Q.; Wang, J.; Yang, W.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.042010v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.042010v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,False
29,"Relevance of enriched expression of SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 in gastrointestinal tissue with pathogenesis of digestive symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and disease recurrence in COVID-19 patients","COVID-19, is caused by a new strain of coronavirus called SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a positive sense single strand RNA virus. In humans, it binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the help a structure on its surface called the S-spike. COVID-19 poses intriguing issues with imperative relevance to clinicians. The pathogenesis of GI symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and disease recurrence in COVID-19 are of particular relevance because they cannot be sufficiently explained from the existing knowledge of the viral diseases. Tissue specific variation of ACE2 expression in healthy individuals can help in understanding the pathophysiological basis the aforementioned collection of symptoms. Materials and Methods: The data were downloaded from the Human Protein Atlas available at (https://www.proteinatlas.org/search/ACE2) and the tissue specific expression (both mRNA and protein) of ACE2 as yielded from the studies with RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was analyzed as a function of the various components of the digestive tract. A digestive system specific functional enrichment map of ACE2 gene was created using g:profiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost) utility and the data were visualized using Cytoscape software, version 3.7.2 (https://cytoscape.org/). Results: The correlated expression (genomic and proteomic) of ACE2 (to which SARS-CoV-2 binds through the S-spike) was found to be enriched in the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (highest in small intestine, followed by colon and rectum), and was undetectable in the upper GIT components: mouth cavity (tongue, oral mucosa, and salivary glands), esophagus, and stomach. High expression of ACE2 was noted in the glandular cells as well as in the enterocytes in the lining epithelium (including brush border epithelium). Among other digestive system organs, GB showed high expression of ACE2 in glandular cells, while any protein expression was undetectable in liver and pancreas. Conclusions: Based on the findings of this study and supportive evidence from the literature we propose that a SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE2 mediates dysregulation of the sodium dependent nutrient transporters and hence may be a plausible basis for the digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients. ACE2 mediated dysregulation of sodium dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1 or SLC5A1) in the intestinal epithelium also links it to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus which can be a possible reason for the associated mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. High expression of ACE2 in mucosal cells of the intestine and gall bladder make these organs potential sites for the virus entry and replication. Continued replication of the virus at these ACE2 enriched sites may be a basis for the disease recurrence reported in some, thought to be cured, patients.","Etiologically Elusive Disorders Research Network (EEDRN),; Kumar, A.; Faiq, M.

30,De novo 3D models of SARS-CoV-2 RNA elements and small-molecule-binding RNAs to guide drug discovery,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 motivates development of antivirals targeting conserved molecular machinery of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes conserved RNA elements that offer potential targets for RNA-targeting small-molecule drugs, but 3D structures of most of these elements have not been experimentally characterized. Here, we provide a dataset called 'FARFAR2-SARS-CoV-2', a collection of 3D coordinates modeled using Rosetta's FARFAR2 algorithm, including de novo models for thirteen RNA elements in SARS-CoV-2 and homology models for a fourteenth. These elements comprise SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, SL5, putative SL6 and SL7 in the extended 5' UTR, as well as the entire extended 5' UTR; the frameshifting element (FSE) from the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a/b gene and a putative dimer of FSE; and the extended pseudoknot, hypervariable region, and the s2m of the 3' UTR, as well as the entire 3' UTR. For five of these elements (SL1, SL2, SL3, FSE, s2m), convergence of lowest predicted energy structures supports their accuracy in capturing low energy states that might be targeted for small molecule binding. To aid efforts to discover small molecule RNA binders guided by computational models, we provide a second benchmarking dataset called 'FARFAR2-Apo-Riboswitch', which consists of similarly prepared Rosetta-FARFAR2 models for RNA riboswitch aptamer regions that bind small molecules. Both datasets include up to 400 3D models for each RNA element, which may facilitate drug discovery approaches targeting dynamic ensembles of low-energy excited states of RNA molecules.","Rangan, R.; Watkins, A.

31,A transcription regulatory network within the ACE2 locus may promote a pro-viral environment for SARS-CoV-2 by modulating expression of host factors.,"Introduction: A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was recently identified as the pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodelling plays a significant role in the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome. Methods: Here, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the ACE2 gene. Results: We identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR, CA5B, and VSP13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Conclusion: Our study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.","Fadason, T.; Gokuladhas, S.; Golovina, E.; Ho, D.; Farrow, S.; Nyaga, D.

32,Glycosaminoglycan binding motif at S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site on spike glycoprotein may facilitate novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) host cell entry,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic and continues to spread around the globe at an unprecedented rate. To date, no effective therapeutic is available to fight its associated disease, COVID-19. Our discovery of a novel insertion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding motif at S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site (681-686 (PRRARS)) and two other GAG-binding-like motifs within SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP) led us to hypothesize that host cell surface GAGs might be involved in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike more tightly bind to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively). In competitive binding studies, the IC50 of heparin, tri-sulfated non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate, and non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin against SARS-CoV-2 SGP binding to immobilized heparin were 0.056 M, 0.12 M, and 26.4 M, respectively. Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation. Our study augments our knowledge in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and advances carbohydrate-based COVID-19 therapeutic development.","Kim, S. Y.; Jin, W.; Sood, A.; Montgomery, D. W.; Grant, O.

33,"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2-controlled autophagy reveals spermidine, MK-2206, and niclosamide as putative antiviral therapeutics","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an acute threat to public health and the world economy, especially because no approved specific drugs or vaccines are available. Pharmacological modulation of metabolism-dependent cellular pathways such as autophagy reduced propagation of highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection limits autophagy by interfering with multiple metabolic pathways and that compound-driven interventions aimed at autophagy induction reduce SARS-CoV-2 propagation in vitro. In-depth analyses of autophagy signaling and metabolomics indicate that SARS-CoV-2 reduces glycolysis and protein translation by limiting activation of AMP-protein activated kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Infection also downregulates autophagy-inducing spermidine, and facilitates AKT1/SKP2-dependent degradation of autophagy-initiating Beclin-1 (BECN1). Targeting of these pathways by exogenous administration of spermidine, AKT inhibitor MK-2206, and the Beclin-1 stabilizing, antihelminthic drug niclosamide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation by 85, 88, and >99%, respectively. In sum, SARS-CoV-2 infection causally diminishes autophagy. A clinically approved and well-tolerated autophagy-inducing compound shows potential for evaluation as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2.","Gassen, N.

34,TMPRSS2 and furin are both essential for proteolytic activation and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cells and provide promising drug targets,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 first reported in Wuhan, China, emerged and rapidly spread to numerous other countries globally, causing the current pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can result in severe disease and lethality. Currently, there is no approved antiviral drug for treating COVID-19 patients and there is an urgent need for specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. In order for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In the present study we investigated which host cell proteases activate the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. We show that S can be cleaved by both the proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the S2 site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with MI-1851 produced more potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine protease inhibitor. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus replication. Our data demonstrate that both TMPRSS2 and furin are essential for SARS-CoV-2 activation in human airway cells and are promising drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 either by targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Therefore, this approach has a high therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.","Bestle, D.; Heindl, M. R.; Limburg, H.; Van Lam van, T.; Pilgram, O.; Moulton, H.; Stein, D.

35,Multidrug treatment with nelfinavir and cepharanthine against COVID-19,"Antiviral treatments targeting the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently required. We screened a panel of already-approved drugs in a cell culture model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and identified two new antiviral agents: the HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir and the anti-inflammatory drug Cepharanthine. In silico modeling shows Nelfinavir binds the SARS-CoV-2 main protease consistent with its inhibition of viral replication, whilst Cepharanthine inhibits viral attachment and entry into cells. Consistent with their different modes of action, in vitro assays highlight a synergistic effect of this combined treatment to limit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation. Mathematical modeling in vitro antiviral activity coupled with the known pharmacokinetics for these drugs predicts that Nelfinavir will facilitate viral clearance. Combining Nelfinavir/Cepharanthine enhanced their predicted efficacy to control viral proliferation, to ameliorate both the progression of disease and risk of transmission.

36,Clinical benefit of remdesivir in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2,"Background: Effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19 are urgently needed. Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: To evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy. Results: In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue. Conclusions: Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques. These data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in COVID-19 patients to prevent progression to severe pneumonia.","Williamson, B.; Feldmann, F.; Schwarz, B.; Meade-White, K.; Porter, D.; Schulz, J.; van Doremalen, N.; Leighton, I.; Yinda, C.

38,Intervention strategies against COVID-19 and their estimated impact on Swedish healthcare capacity,"Objectives: During March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread globally, and non-pharmaceutical interventions are being used to reduce both the load on the healthcare system as well as overall mortality. Design: Individual-based transmission modelling using Swedish demographic and Geographical Information System data and conservative COVID-19 epidemiological parameters. Setting: Sweden Participants: A model to simulate all 10.09 million Swedish residents. Interventions: 5 different non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions including the mitigation strategy of the Swedish government as of 10 April; isolation of the entire household of confirmed cases; closure of schools and non-essential businesses with or without strict social distancing; and strict social distancing with closure of schools and non-essential businesses. Main outcome measures: Estimated acute care and intensive care hospitalisations, COVID-19 attributable deaths, and infections among healthcare workers from 10 April until 29 June. Findings: Our model for Sweden shows that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, the current Swedish public-health strategy will result in a peak intensive-care load in May that exceeds pre-pandemic capacity by over 40-fold, with a median mortality of 96,000 (95% CI 52,000 to 183,000). The most stringent public-health measures examined are predicted to reduce mortality by approximately three-fold. Intensive-care load at the peak could be reduced by over two-fold with a shorter period at peak pandemic capacity. Conclusions: Our results predict that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, current measures in Sweden will result in at least 40-fold over-subscription of pre-pandemic Swedish intensive care capacity, with 15.8 percent of Swedish healthcare workers unable to work at the pandemic peak. Modifications to ICU admission criteria from international norms would further increase mortality.","Gardner, J. M.; Willem, L.; van der Wijngaart, W.; Kamerlin, S. C.

DESIGN: Qualitative study comprising five focus groups carried out online during the early stages of the UK's social distancing and isolation measures (5-12 days post lockdown). SETTING: Online video-conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 27 participants, all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds. RESULTS: The social distancing and isolation associated with COVID-19 policy has had having substantial negative impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of the UK public within a short time of policy implementation. It has disproportionately negatively affected those in low-paid or precarious employment. Practical social and economic losses - the loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine - led to psychological and emotional 'losses' - the loss of motivation, loss of meaning, and loss of self-worth. Participants reported high adherence to distancing and isolation guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others. A central concern for participants was the uncertainty duration of the measures, and their ability to cope longer-term. Some participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid response is necessary in terms of public health programming to mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation. Initial high levels of support for, and adherence to, social distancing and isolation is likely to wane over time, particularly where end dates are uncertain. Social distancing and isolation 'exit strategies' must account for the fact that, although some individuals will voluntarily or habitually continue to socially distance, others will seek high levels of social engagement as soon as possible.","Williams, S.

42,A Preliminary Assessment of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Knowledge and Perceptions in Nigeria,"This study assessed knowledge and perceptions about COVID-19 among the general public in Nigeria during the initial week of the pandemic lockdown in the country. From March 28 to April 4, 2020, this cross-sectional survey used an anonymous online questionnaire to collect data from respondents within Nigeria. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit 1357 respondents, aged 15-70 years, from 180 cities and towns within Nigeria. Study data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Approximately more than half (57.02%) of the respondents were male with a high level of education (48.86% bachelor degree or higher). Approximately half of the respondents (46.94%) opined that COVID-19 was a biological weapon designed by the Chinese government. About 94% of the respondents identified contact with airborne droplets via breathing, sneezing, or coughing as the most common mode of transmission; most respondents associated COVID-19 with coughing (81.13%), shortness of breath (73.47%) and fever (62.79%). Regular hand washing and social distancing were selected by most respondents (94.25%) as a way of preventing infection whereas 11.86% reported consuming gins, garlic, ginger, herbal mixtures and African foods/soups as preventive measures against COVID-19. The majority of the respondents (91.73%) thought COVID-19 is deadly, and most respondents (84.3%) got 4 or more answers correctly. It was also observed that the traditional media (TV/Radio) is the most common source of health information about COVID-19 (93.5%). Findings revealed that Nigerians have relatively high knowledge, mostly derived from traditional media, about COVID-19. Their perceptions of COVID-19 bear implications across public health initiatives, compliance with precautionary behavior as well as bilateral relations with foreign nations.

43,Modeling COVID-19: Forecasting and analyzing the dynamics of the outbreak in Hubei and Turkey,"As the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) rages throughout the world, accurate modeling of the dynamics thereof is essential. However, since the availability and quality of data varies dramatically from region to region, accurate modeling directly from a global perspective is difficult, if not altogether impossible. Nevertheless, via local data collected by certain regions, it is possible to develop accurate local prediction tools, which may be coupled to develop global models. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of local outbreaks of COVID-19 via a coupled system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Utilizing the large amount of data available from the ebbing outbreak in Hubei, China as a testbed, we estimate the basic reproductive number, R0 of COVID-19 and predict the total cases, total deaths, and other features of the Hubei outbreak with a high level of accuracy. Through numerical experiments, we observe the effects of quarantine, social distancing, and COVID-19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak. Using knowledge gleaned from the Hubei outbreak, we apply our model to analyze the dynamics of outbreak in Turkey. We provide forecasts for the peak of the outbreak and the total number of cases/deaths in Turkey, for varying levels of social distancing, quarantine, and COVID-19 testing.","Aslan, i.

44,Cardiac or Infectious? Transfer Learning with Chest X-Rays for ER Patient Classification,One of the challenges with urgent evaluation of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the emergency room (ER) is distinguishing between cardiac vs infectious etiologies for their pulmonary findings. We evaluated ER patient classification for cardiac and infection causes with clinical data and chest X-ray image data. We show that a deep-learning model trained with an external image data set can be used to extract image features and improve the classification accuracy of a data set that does not contain enough image data to train a deep-learning model. We also conducted clinical feature importance analysis and identified the most important clinical features for ER patient classification. This model can be upgraded to include a SARS-CoV-2 specific classification with COVID-19 patients data.

45,Self-Collected Oral Fluid and Nasal Swabs Demonstrate Comparable Sensitivity to Clinician Collected Nasopharyngeal Swabs for Covid-19 Detection,"Background: Currently, there is a pandemic caused by the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes Covid-19. We wanted to compare specimen types and collection methods to explore if a simpler to collect specimen type could expand access to testing. Methods: We recruited individuals recently tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection through a testing program (drive-through). In homes of participants, we assessed the performance of self-collected oral fluid swab specimens with and without clinician supervision, clinician-supervised self-collected mid-turbinate (nasal) swab specimens, and clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We tested specimens with a validated reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and measured cycle threshold values. Symptom status and date of onset of symptoms was also recorded for each participant. Results: We recruited 45 participants. The median age of study participant was 42 years old (Interquartile range, 31 to 52 years). Of the participants, 29 had at least one specimen test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 21 (73%) of 29 reported active symptoms. By specimen type and home-based collection method, clinician-supervised self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 26 (90%) of 29 infected individuals, clinician-supervised self-collected nasal swab specimens detected 23 (85%) of 27, clinician-collected posterior nasopharyngeal swab specimens detected 23 (79%) of 29, and unmonitored self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 19 (66%) of 29. Despite nasopharyngeal swabs being considered the gold standard, 4 participants tested negative by clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab and positive by the 3 other specimen types. Additionally, false negative results by each sample type were seen to generally not overlap. Conclusions: Supervised self-collected oral fluid and nasal swab specimens performed similarly to, if not better than clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sample type captured all SARS-CoV-2 infections, suggesting potential heterogeneity in the distribution of viral load in different parts of the respiratory tract between individuals. Supervised self-collection performed comparably to clinician collection and would allow for rapid expansion of testing capacity in the United States by reducing the need for trained healthcare workers, reducing exposure of healthcare workers, and reducing the amount of PPE (personal protective equipment) being used for testing during a critical shortage.","Kojima, N.; Turner, F.; Slepnev, V.; Bacelar, A.; Deming, L.; Kodeboyina, S.; Klausner, J.

46,"A survey-based study on the knowledge, attitude, and the practices pertaining to the 2019 novel Corona Virusinfection amongst undergraduate medical students in India","Background. In the light of recent outbreak of COVID19 Pandemic for which is there no specific treatment, prevention and awareness is the only key to overcome an adversity of such magnitude. Thus, we aimed to understand the knowledge, attitude and practices of undergraduate medical students pertaining to infection with the COVID19. Methods. An electronic survey developed using an online cloud-based website (Survey Monkey) was served to undergraduate medical students. Participants had a week to voluntarily complete the 8 minute long questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and figures were obtained from surveymonkey.com. Results. Of 2507 invitees across six medical colleges in India, 616 (24.6%) responded. Most undergraduates (age 21.5 years, 46.1% males) were undergoing internship (16.7%) or final year undergraduate training (54.1%). Knowledge regarding viral transmission, clinical-radiologic features, laboratory diagnosis and treatment was adequate among most students (Fig 1). However, the understanding of the incubation period and time to symptoms was less than satisfactory (Supplementary Table 1). Nearly three-fourths 461 (74.8%) were aware of the COVID-19 specific precautions. While their universities had advised most regarding hand hygiene, social distancing, symptom identification, and high-risk groups, fewer were advised to avoid staying back in hostels or drug prevention. Nearly 70% were reluctant to attend clinics from fear of getting infected or passing on to others. Most students read about COVID-19 regularly, and social media accounts of medical journals were the primary 78.9% source. Conclusion. Most medical students are aware of the basics of COVID19 infection and act as a potential reservoir to fill the gaps in Healthcare services should the need arise.","Gupta, L.; Agarwal, V.; Davalbhakta, S.; Agarwal, V.; Misra, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061333v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061333v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,True
47,"Modifying reusable elastomeric respirators to utilise breathing system filters with 3D printed adapters, a safe alternative to N95 during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment including N95 and FFP3 respirators. Reusable elastomeric respirators are suitable alternatives when used with compatible filters. These filters may be difficult to source and elastomeric respirators are not recommended for surgical use as the exhaled air is not filtered. Breathing system filters are routinely used in anaesthetic circuits to filter virus and bacteria. In this study, we designed 3D printed adapters that allowed elastomeric respirators to utilise breathing system filters and made simple modifications to the respirators to filter exhaled breaths. We then evaluated the performance and safety of our modified elastomeric respirators with quantitative fit tests. We recruited 8 volunteers to perform quantitative fit tests. Fit factors, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded before and after wearing the modified respirators for 1 hour. All 8 volunteers obtained fit factors of 200+, the maximum achievable, for all tests exercises in all fit tests. The mean (range) end-tidal carbon dioxide was 4.5 (3.9-5.5) kPa and 4.6 (range 4.1-5.3) kPa before and after 1 hour of usage. The mean (range) respiratory rate was 16.5 (11-24) min-1 and 17.4 (15-22) min-1 before and after 1 hour of usage. Four (50%) did not experience any subjective discomfort while 2 (25%) reported pressure on the face, 1 (12.5%) reported exhalation resistance and 1 (12.5%) reported transient dizziness with exertion. Breathing system filters combined with properly fitted reusable elastomeric respirators is a safe alternative to N95 during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, D. C. Y.; Koo, T. H.; Wong, J. K.

48,An epidemiologic profile of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam,"Background and Aim. There is a paucity of data on the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. In this paper, we sought to provide an epidemiologic description of patients who were infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Vietnam. Methods. Data were abstracted from the wikipedia's COVID-19 information resource and Johns Hopkins University Dashboard. Demographic data and treatment status were obtained for each patient in each day. The coverage period was from 23/1/2020 to 10/4/2020. Descriptive analyses of incident cases were stratified by gender and age group. The estimation of the reproduction ratio was done with a bootstrap method using the R statistical environment. Results. During the coverage period, Vietnam has recorded 257 cases of COVID-19. Approximately 54% of the cases were women. The median age of patients was 30 years (range: 3 months to 88 years), with 78% of patients aged 49 or younger. About 66% (n = 171) of patients were overseas tourists (20%) and Vietnamese students or workers returning from overseas (46%). Approximately 57% (n = 144) of patients have been recovered and discharged from hospitals. There have been no mortality. The reproduction ratio was estimated to range between 0.95 and 1.24. Conclusion. These data indicate that a majority of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam was imported cases in overseas tourists and young students and workers who had returned from overseas.","Nguyen, H.

49,Clinical Efficacy of Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy in Critical Patients with COVID-19: A multicenter retrospective cohort study,"Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world, causing more than 1.5 million infections and over ten thousands of deaths in a short period of time. However, little is known about its pathological mechanism, and there are still no clinical study reports on specific treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy on COVID-19. Methods In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, adult critical COVID-19 patients (including severe type and critical type, according to the clinical classification defined by National Health Commission of China) in 8 government designated treatment center in China from Dec 23, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020 were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, prognosis were extracted from electronic medical records, and IVIG was exposure factor. Primary outcomes were the 28 days and 60 days mortality, and secondary outcomes were the total length of in-hospital and the total duration of the disease. Meanwhile, the parameters of inflammation response and organ function were detected. The risk factors were determined by COX proportional hazards model. The subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification of COVID-19, IVIG dosage and timing. Findings 325patients were included in this study, of whom 222 (68%) were severe type, 103 (32%) were critical type. 42 (13%) died in 28 days within hospitalization, total 54 (17%) died in 60 days, and 6 (3%) died in severe type, 48 (47%) died in critical type. 174 cases were used IVIG, and 151 cases were not. Compared with the baseline characteristics between two groups, the results showed that the patients in IVIG group had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHII) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, IL-6 and lactate level, lower lymphocyte count and oxygenation index (all P<0.05). The 28 day and 60 day mortality did not improve with IVIG in overall patients. The in-hospital stay and the total duration of disease were longer in IVIG group (p<0.001). Risk factors were clinical classification (hazards ratio 0.126, 95% confidence interval 0.039-0.413, P=0.001), and using IVIG (hazards ratio 0.252, 95% confidence interval 0.107-0.591, P=0.002) with COX regression. Subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with critical type, IVIG could significantly reduce the 28 day mortality, decrease the inflammatory response and improve some organ functions (all p<0.05), and 60-day mortality reduced significantly by using IVIG in the early stage (admission[&le;]7 days) and with high dose (>15 g/d). Interpretation Early and high dose of IVIG therapy may improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients only in critical type, which provides the clinical basis for the choice of treatment population and method of IVIG therapy for the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

51,A High-Coverage SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequence Acquired by Target Capture Sequencing,"This manuscript is based on the method we developed urgently to deal with the research requirement in the conflict between achieving a complete genome sequence for the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 study and the low viral RNA concentration. Here, in this manuscript, we developed a set of SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probes to increase the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization via obtaining the comprehensive genome sequence. Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, we test the concept using the culturing supernatant contain SARS-CoV-2 particles, and its full-length sequence was used for further analysis. The fraction of SARS-CoV-2 endogenous DNA was 93.47% with Cluster Factor about 1.1, which demonstrate that the numbers of mapped reads to SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence significantly increased, compared to metagenomic sequencing technology, following SARS-CoV-2 probe enrichment. Moreover, based on the high-quality sequence, we discussed the heterozygosity and viral expression during replication of coronavirus, and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high-quality samples from The Genome Variation Map (GVM) (on 2020/03/22). We believe this manuscript is valuable for all the researchers who are interested in using clinical warp samples to obtain the high coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence with a relatively low concentration of viral particles. This would allow the clinician to correlate the diagnostic data with molecular monitoring in viral evolutional, the most importantly, to track the functional mutation of SARS-CoV-2.","wen, s.; Zhang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061507v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061507v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,True
52,When Resources Are Scarce - Feasibility of Emergency Ventilation of Two Patients With One Ventilator,"A potential shortage of intensive care ventilators has led to the idea to ventilate more than one patient with a single ventilator. Besides other problems, this is associated with the lack of knowledge concerning distribution of tidal volume and the patients' individual respiratory system mechanics. In this study we used two simple hand-manufactured adaptors to connect physical models of two adult respiratory systems to one ventilator. The artificial lungs were ventilated in the pressure-controlled mode and we investigated if disconnecting one lung from the ventilation circuit for several breaths would allow to determine reliably the other lung's tidal volume and compliance. Compliances and volumes were measured both with the ventilator and external sensors corresponded well. However, tidal volumes measured via the ventilator were smaller compared to the tidal volumes measured via the external sensors with an absolute error of 5.3 +/- 2.5%. The tidal volumes of the individual artificial lungs were distributed in proportion to the compliances and did not differ relevantly when both artificial lungs were connected to when one was disconnected. We conclude that in case of emergency, ventilation of two patients with one ventilator requires two simple hand-crafted tubes as adaptors and available standard breathing circuit components. In such a setting, respiratory system mechanics and tidal volume of each individual patient can be reliably measured during short term clamping of the tracheal tube of the respective other patient.","Reinacher, P.

53,Challenges in control of Covid-19: short doubling time and long delay to effect of interventions,"Early assessments of the spreading rate of COVID-19 were subject to significant uncertainty, as expected with limited data and difficulties in case ascertainment, but more reliable inferences can now be made. Here, we estimate from European data that COVID-19 cases are expected to double initially every three days, until social distancing interventions slow this growth, and that the impact of such measures is typically only seen nine days - i.e. three doubling times - after their implementation. We argue that such temporal patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the basic reproduction number for initiating interventions. This observation has particular implications for the low-and middle-income countries currently in the early stages of their local epidemics.","Pellis, L.; Scarabel, F.; Stage, H. B.; Overton, C.

54,Rapid prototyping and clinical testing of a reusable face shield for health care workers responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,"Due to supply chain disruption, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care professionals. Local fabrication based on 3D printing is one way to address this challenge, particularly in the case of simple products such as protective face shields. As a consequence, many public domain designs for face shields have become available. No clear path exists, however, for introducing a locally fabricated and unapproved product into a clinical setting. In a US health care setting, face shields are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); similar policies exist in other countries. We describe a research protocol under which rapid iteration on an existing design, coupled with clinical feedback and real-world testing in an emergency department, allowed a face shield to be adopted by the incident command team at a major academic medical center. We describe our design and testing process and provide an overview of regulatory considerations associated with fabrication and testing of face shields and related products. All designs, materials used, testing protocols, and survey results are reported in full to facilitate the execution of similar face shield efforts in other clinical settings.

We also included data from preprint articles. Study selection : Original case reports and case series on pregnant women with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data extraction : We included 23 studies [China (20), USA (01), Republic of Korea (01) and Honduras, Central America (01) reporting the information on 172 pregnant women and 162 neonates. The primary outcome measures were maternal health characteristics and adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates was extracted. Treatments given to pregnant women with COVID-19 were also recorded. Results: Out of 172 women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, 160 women had delivered 162 newborns (2 set of twins, 12 ongoing pregnancies). In pregnant women with COVID-19, the most common symptoms were fever (54%), cough (35%), myalgia (17%), dyspnea (12%) and diarrhea (4%). Pneumonia was diagnosed by CT scan imaging in 100 % of COVID-19 pregnant women. Pregnancy complications included delivery by cesarean section (89%), preterm labor (21%), fetal distress (9%) and premature rupture of membranes (8%). The most common co-morbidities associated with pregnant women with COVID-19 were diabetes (11%), hypertensive disorders (9%), placental disorders (5%), co-infections (6%), scarred uterus (5%), hypothyroidism (5%) and anemia (4%). Amongst the neonates of COVID-19 mothers, preterm birth (23%), respiratory distress syndrome (14%), pneumonia (14%) low birth weight (11%), small for gestational age (3%) were reported. There was one still birth and one neonatal death reported. Vertical transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 11%. Conclusion In pregnant women with COVID-19, diabetes and hypertensive disorders are common co-morbidities and there is a risk of preterm delivery.

57,COVID-19 outbreak at a large homeless shelter in Boston: Implications for universal testing,"The circumstances of homelessness create the potential for rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this vulnerable population. Upon observing a cluster of COVID-19 cases from a single large homeless shelter in Boston, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program conducted symptom assessments and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 among all guests residing at the shelter over a 2-day period. Of 408 participants, 147 (36.0%) were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-positive individuals were more likely to be male (p<0.001) but did not differ significantly from COVID-negative individuals with respect to other demographic and clinical characteristics. Cough (7.5%), shortness of breath (1.4%), and fever (0.7%) were all uncommon among COVID-positive individuals.

58,"Surveillance by age-class and prefecture for emerging infectious febrile diseases with respiratory symptoms, including COVID-19","Object The COVID-19 outbreak emerged in late 2019 in China, expanding rapidly thereafter. Even in Japan, epidemiological linkage of transmission was probably lost already by February 18, 2020. From that time, it has been necessary to detect clusters using syndromic surveillance. Method We identified common symptoms of COVID-19 as fever and respiratory symptoms. Therefore, we constructed a model to predict the number of patients with antipyretic analgesics (AP) and multi-ingredient cold medications (MIC) controlling well-known pediatric infectious diseases including influenza or RS virus infection. To do so, we used the National Official Sentinel Surveillance for Infectious Diseases (NOSSID), even though NOSSID data are weekly data with 10 day delays, on average. The probability of a cluster with unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms is a product of the probabilities of aberrations in AP and MIC, which is defined as one minus the probability of the number of patients prescribed a certain type of drug in PS compared to the number predicted using a model. This analysis was conducted prospectively in 2020 using data from October 1, 2010 through 2019 by prefecture and by age-class. Results The probability of unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptom cluster was estimated as less than 60% in 2020. Discussion The most severe limitation of the present study is that the proposed model cannot be validated. A large outbreak of an unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms must be experienced, at which time, practitioners will have to wing it. We expect that no actual cluster of unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms will occur, but if it should occur, we hope to detect it.","Ueno, T.; Kurita, J.; Sugawara, T.; Sugishita, Y.; Ohkusa, Y.; Kawanohara, H.; Kamei, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061697v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061697v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,True

We sought to calculate the current reproduction number for COVID-19 for each state in the United States. For the entire United States, the reproduction number declined from 4.02 to 1.51 between March 17 and April 1, 2020. We also found that the reproduction number for COVID-19 has declined in most states over the past two weeks which suggests that social isolation measures may be having a beneficial effect.","Gunzler, D.; Sehgal, A.

60,"Clinical characteristics of 34 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in Hangzhou, China","Introduction: The purpose of the study was to summarize the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to intensive care unit. Methods: We tracked the data until March 5, 2020. The cases in our cohort were divided into cases only received noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and cases required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The characteristics between the two groups were compared. Results: 34 cases were included in the study. The complications rate (including, acute liver injury, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury) were higher in IMV cases. Lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia occurred in most cases in both groups on the admission day, however, lymphocyte levels dropped progressively and more severe lymphopenia occurred in IMV group. Increased amounts of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were found in both groups on the admission day, the progressive decrease of which occurred in NIV cases rather than IMV cases, and the levels were higher in IMV cases during hospitalization. Conclusions: Lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, and increase of IL-6 and IL-10 occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in ICU, however, the dynamics of those were significantly different in IMV cases and NIV cases during hospitalization.","Zheng, Y.; Sun, L.; Xu, M.; Pan, J.; Zhang, Y.; Fang, X.; Fang, Q.; Cai, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062604v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062604v1?rss=1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,,True
61,FFP-2 respirator masks in times of crisis,"In view of the shortage of current FFP-2 respirator masks, and therefore the lack of personal protective equipment for clinical staff, we aimed to explore ways of bottom-up solutions to allow hospitals to fabricate respirator masks that (i) fulfill FFP-2 criteria, (ii) are rapid and easy to produce to enable sufficient local production, and (iii) are constructed from materials that are routinely available in hospitals worldwide. In our investigation, particular surgical isolation and wrapping material fulfilled these criteria. With 3 layers of this material, a filter efficiency of 94% for 0.3 um particles, 99% for 0.5 um particles, and 100% for 3.0 um particles was obtained. After sterilization the filter efficiency allowed re-use as a FFP-1 respirator mask. This knowledge can contribute to global health, in any country and/or hospital that may not have access to otherwise commercial solutions.","Meijer, J. H.; Oude Vrielink, T. J.

62,COVID-19 is an emergent disease of aging,"COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that poses one of the greatest challenges to public health in recent years. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and often leads to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and death in the elderly and subjects with pre-existing conditions, but the reason for this age dependence is unclear. Here, we found that the case fatality rate for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age in Italy, Spain, South Korea, and China, with the doubling time approaching that of all-cause human mortality. In addition, men and those with multiple age-related diseases are characterized by increased mortality. Moreover, similar mortality patterns were found for all-cause pneumonia. We further report that the gene expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, grows in the lung with age, except for subjects on a ventilator. Together, our findings establish COVID-19 as an emergent disease of aging, and age and age-related diseases as its major risk factors. In turn, this suggests that COVID-19, and deadly respiratory diseases in general, may be targeted, in addition to therapeutic approaches that affect specific pathways, by approaches that target the aging process.","Santesmasses, D.; Castro, J.

64,Transmission routes of Covid-19 virus in the Diamond Princess Cruise ship,"Background: An outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January and February 2020. We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission. Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. Conclusions: We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak. Most transmission appears to have occurred through close contact and fomites.","Xu, P.; Qian, H.; Miao, T.; Yen, H.-l.; Tan, H.; Cowling, B. J.; Li, Y.

65,Standardization and Age-Distribution of COVID-19: Implications for Variability in Case Fatality and Outbreak Identification,"Background: Epidemiological data from the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated variability in attack rates by age, and country-to-country variability in case fatality ratio (CFR). Objective: To use direct and indirect standardization for insights into the impact of age-specific under-reporting on between-country variability in CFR, and apparent size of COVID-19 epidemics. Design: Post-hoc secondary data analysis (case studies), and mathematical modeling. Setting: China, global. Interventions: None. Measurements: Data were extracted from a sentinel epidemiological study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) that describes attack rates and CFR for COVID-19 in China prior to February 12, 2020. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were used to impute missing cases and adjust CFR. Age-specific attack rates and CFR were applied to different countries with differing age structures (Italy, Japan, Indonesia, and Egypt), in order to generate estimates for CFR, apparent epidemic size, and time to outbreak recognition for identical age-specific attack rates. Results: SMR demonstrated that 50-70% of cases were likely missed during the Chinese epidemic. Adjustment for under-recognition of younger cases decreased CFR from 2.4% to 0.8% (assuming 50% case ascertainment in older individuals). Standardizing the Chinese epidemic to countries with older populations (Italy, and Japan) resulted in larger apparent epidemic sizes, higher CFR and earlier outbreak recognition. The opposite effect was demonstrated for countries with younger populations (Indonesia, and Egypt). Limitations: Secondary data analysis based on a single country at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no attempt to incorporate second order effects (ICU saturation) on CFR. Conclusion: Direct and indirect standardization are simple tools that provide key insights into between-country variation in the apparent size and severity of COVID-19 epidemics.","Fisman, D.; Greer, A.; Tuite, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059832v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059832v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
66,Real-time forecasts and risk assessment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases: A data-driven analysis,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting 201 countries and territories around the globe. As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide. The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.","Chakraborty, T.; Ghosh, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059311v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059311v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
67,Forecasting the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya,"Background The first COVID-19 case in Kenya was confirmed on March 13th, 2020. Here, we provide forecasts for the potential incidence rate, and magnitude, of a COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya based on the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases observed in China, whilst accounting for the demographic and geographic dissimilarities between China and Kenya. Methods We developed a modelling framework to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya, KenyaCoV. KenyaCoV was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission both within, and between, different Kenyan regions and age groups. KenyaCoV was parameterized using a combination of human mobility data between the defined regions, the recent 2019 Kenyan census, and estimates of age group social interaction rates specific to Kenya. Key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproductive number and the age-specific rate of developing COVID-19 symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2, were adapted for the Kenyan setting from a combination of published estimates and analysis of the age distribution of cases observed in the Chinese outbreak. Results We find that if person-to-person transmission becomes established within Kenya, identifying the role of subclinical, and therefore largely undetected, infected individuals is critical to predicting and containing a very significant epidemic. Depending on the transmission scenario our reproductive number estimates for Kenya range from 1.78 (95% CI 1.44 - 2.14) to 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17). In scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly, we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation. In these scenarios, there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected (median estimates: >80% over six months), and a significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission, flattening the epidemic curve, but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high.","Brand, S. P.

69,A novel high specificity COVID-19 screening method based on simple blood exams and artificial intelligence,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 poses a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Despite governmental initiatives aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in the demand for ICU beds, medical equipment, and larger testing capacity. Efficient COVID-19 diagnosis enables healthcare systems to provide better care for patients while protecting caregivers from the disease. However, many countries are constrained by the limited amount of test kits available, the lack of equipment and trained professionals. In the case of patients visiting emergency rooms (ERs) with a suspect of COVID-19, a prompt diagnosis can improve the outcome and even provide information for efficient hospital management. In this context, a quick, inexpensive and readily available test to perform an initial triage at ER could help to smooth patient flow, provide better patient care, and reduce the backlog of exams. Methods: In this Case-control quantitative study, we developed a strategy backed by artificial intelligence to perform an initial screening of suspect COVID-19 cases. We developed a machine learning classifier that takes widely available simple blood exams as input and predicts if that suspect case is likely to be positive (having SARS-CoV-2) or negative(not having SARS-CoV-2). Based on this initial classification, positive cases can be referred for further highly sensitive testing (e.g. CT scan, or specific antibodies). We used publicly available data from the Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil from 5,644 patients. Focussing on using simple blood exams, a sample of 599 subjects that had the fewest missing values for 16 common exams were selected. From these 599 patients, only 81 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (determined by RT-PCR). Based on this data, we built an artificial intelligence classification framework, ER-CoV, aiming at determining which patients were more likely to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 when visiting an ER and that were categorized as a suspect case by medical professionals. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a classifier with high specificity and high negative predictive values, with reasonable sensitivity. Findings: We identified that our framework achieved an average specificity of 92.16% [95% CI 91.73 - 92.59] and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.29% [95% CI 94.65% - 95.90%]. Those values are completely aligned with our goal of providing an effective low-cost system to triage suspected patients at ERs. As for sensitivity, our model achieved an average of 63.98% [95% CI 59.82% - 67.50%] and positive predictive value (PPV) of 48.00% [95% CI 44.88% - 51.56%]. An error analysis identified that, on average, 45% of the false negative results would have been hospitalized anyway, thus the model is making mistakes for severe cases that would not be overlooked, partially mitigating the fact that the test is not high-sensitive. All code for our AI model, called ER-CoV is publicly available at https://github.com/soares-f/ER-CoV. Interpretation: Based on the capacity of our model to accurately predict which cases are negative from suspected patients arriving at emergency rooms, we envision that this framework can play an important role in patient triage. Probably the most important outcome is related to testing availability, which at this point is extremely low in many countries. Considering the achieved specificity, we would reduce by at least 90% the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at emergency rooms, with the chance of getting a false negative at around 5%. The second important outcome is related to patient management in hospitals. Patients predicted as positive by our framework could be immediately separated from the other patients while waiting for the results of confirmatory tests. This could reduce the spread rate inside hospitals since in many hospitals all suspected cases are kept in the same ward. In Brazil, where the data was collected, rate infection is starting to quickly spread, the lead time of a SARS-CoV-2 can be up to 2 weeks.

Creating models to describe and quantify alternative mitigation strategies becomes increasingly urgent. Methods: In this study, we propose an agent-based model of disease transmission in a society divided into closely connected families, workplaces, and social groups. This allows us to discuss mitigation strategies, including targeted quarantine measures. Results: We find that workplace and more diffuse social contacts are roughly equally important to disease spread, and that an effective lockdown must target both. We examine the cost-benefit of replacing a lockdown with tracing and quarantine contacts of the infected. When reopening society, testing and quarantining is a strategy that is much cheaper in terms of lost workdays than a long lockdown of workplaces. Conclusions: A targeted quarantine strategy is quite efficient with only 5 days of quarantine, and its relative effect increases when supplemented with other measures that reduce disease transmission.","Eilersen, A.; Sneppen, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059790v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059790v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True

In this study, we develop a mathematical model to explore the effect of social distancing on new disease infections. Mathematical analyses of our model indicate that successful eradication of the disease is strongly dependent on the chosen preventive measure. Numerical computations of the model solution demonstrate that the ability to flatten the curve becomes easier as social distancing is strictly enforced. Based on our model, we also formulate an optimal control problem and solve it using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and an efficient numerical iterative method. Our numerical results of an optimal 2019-nCoV treatment protocol that yields a minimum disease burden from this disease indicates that social distancing is vitally important.","Mallela, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20061069v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20061069v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
72,Global convergence of COVID-19 basic reproduction number and estimation from early-time SIR dynamics,"The SIR ('susceptible-infectious-recovered') formulation is used to uncover the generic spread mechanisms observed by COVID-19 dynamics globally, especially in the early phases of infectious spread. During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number Ro. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many nations) to an uncontrolled Ro=4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of Ro=2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation. Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled Ro are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed for assessing health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in Ro > 2.7 within 49 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19. Current optimistic projections place mortality figures in the USA in the range of 100,000 fatalities. For fatalities to be confined to 100,000 requires a reduction in Ro from 4.5 to 2.7 within 17 days of first infection assuming a mortality rate of 3.4%. This rapid reduction in Ro is outside the range of possibilities for the USA.","Katul, G. G.; Mrad, A.; Bonetti, S.; Manoli, G.; Parolari, A.

73,Diminishing Marginal Benefit of Social Distancing in Balancing COVID-19 Medical Demand-to-Supply,"Social distancing has been adopted as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from overwhelming the medical resources across the United States (US). The catastrophic socio-economic impacts of this intervention could outweigh its benefits if the timing and duration of implementation are left uncontrolled and ill-strategized. Here we investigate the dynamics of social distancing on age-stratified US population and benchmark its effectiveness in reducing the burden on hospital and ICU beds. Our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. We determine an optimal intermittent social-to-no-distancing ratio of 5:1 corresponding to ~80% reduction in healthcare demands; beyond this ratio, benefit of social distancing diminishes to a negligible level.

74,Between Geography and Demography: Key Interdependencies and Exit Mechanisms for Covid-19,"We develop a minimalist compartmental model to analyze policies on mobility restriction in Italy during the Covid-19 outbreak. Our findings show that a early lockdowns barely shift the epidemic in time: moreover, beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, an epidemic that seems to be quelled fully recovers after lifting the restrictions. We investigate the effects on lockdown scenarios and exit mechanisms by introducing heterogeneities in the model. In particular, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities in which social interactions through different age classes occur. We find that, due to the sparsity of the mobility matrix, epidemics developed independently in different regions once the outbreak starts. Moreover, after the epidemics ha started, the influence of contacts with other regions becomes soon irrelevant. Sparsity accounts for the observed delays across different regions. Analogous arguments would apply to the international borders. We also show how disregarding the structure of social contacts could lead to severe underestimation of the post-lockdown effects. Nevertheless, age class based mechanisms can help to mitigate rebound effects with milder strategies. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized beyond this particular model by providing a description of the effects of key parameters on non-medical mitigation strategies for epidemics.","Scala, A.; Flori, A.; Spelta, A.; Brugnoli, E.; Cinelli, M.; Quattrociocchi, W.; Pammolli, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059592v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059592v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
75,Near- and forecasting the SARS-COV-2 epidemic requires a global view and multiple methods,"Conventional epidemiological models require estimates of important parameters including incubation time and case fatality rate that may be unavailable in the early stage of an epidemic. For the ongoing SARS-COV-2 epidemic, with no previous population exposure, alternative prediction methods less reliant on assumptions may prove more effective in the near-term. We present three methods used to provide early estimates of likely SARS-COV-2 epidemic progression. During the first stage of the epidemic, growth rate charts revealed the UK, Italy and Spain as outliers, with differentially increasing growth of deaths over cases. A novel data-driven time-series model was then used to near-cast 7-day future cases and deaths with much greater precision. Finally, an epidemio-statistical model was used to bridge from near-casting to forecasting the future course of the global epidemic. By applying multiple approaches to global SARS-COV-2 data, coupled with mixed-effects methods, countries further ahead in the epidemic provide valuable information for those behind. Using current daily global data, we note convergence in near-term predictions for Italy signifying an appropriate call on the future course of the global epidemic. For the UK and elsewhere, prediction of peak and eventual time to resolution is now possible.","Austin, D.

76,Myocyte Specific Upregulation of ACE2 in Cardiovascular Disease: Implications for SARS-CoV-2 mediated myocarditis,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells occurs predominantly via binding of the viral surface spike protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Hypertension and pre-existing cardiovascular disease are risk factors for morbidity from COVID-19, and it remains uncertain whether the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) impacts infection and disease.

77,Forecasting Covid-19 Outbreak Progression in Italian Regions: A model based on neural network training from Chinese data,"Background. Epidemiological figures of Covid19 epidemic in Italy are worse than those observed in China. Methods. We modeled the Covid19 outbreak in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics progression and predict peaks of new daily infections and total cases by learning from the entire Chinese epidemiological dynamics. We trained an artificial neural network model, a modified auto-encoder with Covid19 Chinese data, to forecast epidemic curve of the different Italian regions, and use the susceptible/exposed/infected/removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading and peaks. We have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection - both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a one month period, and also by using a day by day assessment, based on single observations. Results. The expected peak of SEIR model for new daily cases was at the end of March at national level. The peak of overall positive cases is expected by April 11th in Southern Italian Regions, a couple of days after that of Lombardy and Northern regions. According to our model, total confirmed cases in all Italy regions could reach 160,000 cases by April 30th and stabilize at a plateau. Conclusions. Training neural networks on Chinese data and use the knowledge to forecast Italian spreading of Covid19 has resulted in a good fit, measured with the mean average precision between official Italian data and the forecast.","Distante, C.; Gadelha Pereira, I.; Garcia Goncalves, L.

78,Relationship between Average Daily Temperature and Average Cumulative Daily Rate of Confirmed Cases of COVID-19,"The rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.","Pirouz, B.; Golmohammadi, A.; Saeidpour Masouleh, H.; Violini, G.; Pirouz, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20059337v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20059337v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
79,Using random testing to manage a safe exit from the COVID-19 lockdown,"We argue that random testing (i.e., polling the fraction of infected people in the population) is central to managing the COVID-19 pandemic because it both measures the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare system via the progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes will therefore (i) significantly improve the predictability of the course of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates (such as new tracing strategies based on the mobile telephone network, wearing face masks, etc.). Frequent random testing for COVID-19 infections has the essential benefit of providing more reliable and refined data than currently available, in both time and space. This is crucial to accompany and monitor the safe release of restrictive measures. Here we show that independent of the total size of population with frequent interactions among its members, about 15000 tests with randomly selected people per day suffice to obtain valuable data about the current number of infections and their evolution in time. In contrast to testing confined to particular subpopulations such as those displaying symptoms, this will allow close to real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. With yet higher testing capacity, random testing further allows detection of geographical differences in spreading rates and thus the formulation of optimal strategies for a safe reboot of the economy. Most importantly, with daily random testing in place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a reboot without such polling.","Mueller, M.; Derlet, P.; Mudry, C.; Aeppli, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059360v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059360v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True

81,Genetic variability in the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry factors across populations,"The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is dependent upon angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as a functional attachment receptor for the viral spike glycoprotein, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 which allows fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. We devised a quantitative measure to estimate genetic determinants of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and applied this measure to >2,500 individuals. Our data show significant variability in genetic determinants of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression among individuals and between populations, and demonstrate a genetic predisposition for lower expression levels of both key viral entry genes in African populations. These data suggest that genetic factors might lead to lower susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection in African populations and that host genetics might help explain inter-individual variability in disease susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.","Ortiz-Fernandez, L.; Sawalha, A.

82,"Identification of potential vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2, A step forward to fight novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: A Reverse Vaccinology Approach","The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes an immense health crisis to global public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 is the etiologic agent of a recently arose disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Presently, there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease. Therefore, it is indeed a need of the hour to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this decidedly pandemic disease. In the current study, we collected SARS-CoV-2 genome from Indian geographical origin against human host, further more using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics tools here we claim effective vaccine candidates that can be mile stone in battle against COVID19. This novel study divulged two promising antigenic peptide GVYFASTEK and NFRVQPTESIV from surface glycoproteins (protein accession no. - QIA98583.1 and QHS34546.1) of SARS-CoV-2, which were predicated to be interacted with class I and class II MHC alleles and showed up to 90% conservancy and high value of antigenicity. Subsequently, the molecular docking studies were verified molecular interaction of these prime antigenic peptides with the residues of HLA-A*11-01 allele for MHC Class I and HLA DRB1*04-01 allele for MHC class II. After vigorous analysis, these peptides were predicted to be suitable epitopes which are capable to elicit the strong cell-mediated immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequences from the present study could facilitate selecting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for vaccine production pipelines in the immediate future.

83,Improving COVID-19 Testing Efficiency using Guided Agglomerative Sampling,"One of the challenges in the current COVID-19 crisis is the time and cost of performing tests especially for large-scale population surveillance. Since, the probability of testing positive in large population studies is expected to be small (<15%), therefore, most of the test outcomes will be negative. Here, we propose the use of agglomerative sampling which can prune out multiple negative cases in a single test by intelligently combining samples from different individuals. The proposed scheme builds on the assumption that samples from the population may not be independent of each other. Our simulation results show that the proposed sampling strategy can significantly increase testing capacity under resource constraints: on average, a saving of ~40% tests can be expected assuming a positive test probability of 10% across the given samples. The proposed scheme can also be used in conjunction with heuristic or Machine Learning guided clustering for improving the efficiency of large-scale testing further.

84,The origin and underlying driving forces of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 has become a pandemic and impacted many aspects of human society. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination. After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2/23/2020 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1/5/2020 and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020, the lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on 1/21/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China was two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world. In addition, in network analysis, haplotypes collected from Wuhan city were at interior and have more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of cov-19 was originated from China.","Chaw, S.-M.; Tai, J.-H.; Chen, S.-L.; Hsieh, C.-H.; Chang, S.-Y.; Yeh, S.-H.; Yang, W.-S.; Chen, P.-J.; Wang, H.-Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.038554v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.038554v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,False
85,Detection of spreader nodes and ranking of interacting edges in Human-SARS-CoV protein interaction network,"The entire world has recently witnessed the commencement of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is caused by a novel coronavirus (n-CoV) generally distinguished as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has exploited human vulnerabilities to coronavirus outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life. No proven vaccine for n-CoV is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has reached to a consensus that the virus SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2003. It has been reported that SARS-CoV has ~89% genetic similarities with n-CoV. With this hypothesis, the current work focuses on the identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV protein interaction network. Various network characteristics like edge ratio, neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for defining a new feature spreadability index by virtue of which spreader nodes and edges are identified. The selected top spreader nodes having high spreadability index have been also validated by Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) disease model. Initially, the proposed method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by SARS-CoV-human protein interaction network. Hence, key spreader nodes and edges (ranked edges) are unmasked in SARS-CoV proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins. The new network attribute spreadability index along with generated SIS values of selected top spreader nodes when compared with the other network centrality based methodologies like Degree centrality (DC), Closeness centrality (CC), Local average centrality (LAC) and Betweeness centrality (BC) is found to perform relatively better than the existing-state-of-art.","Saha, S.; Chatterjee, P.; Basu, S.; Nasipuri, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.038216v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.12.038216v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,False
86,"Discovery of baicalin and baicalein as novel, natural product inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease in vitro","Human infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and there is currently no cure. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), a highly conserved protease indispensable for replication of coronaviruses, is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. To advance the speed of drug discovery and development, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by natural products derived from Chinese traditional medicines. Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a 'shield' in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.","Su, H.; Yao, S.; Zhao, W.; Li, M.; Liu, J.; Shang, W.; Xie, H.; Ke, C.; Gao, M.; Yu, K.; Liu, H.; Shen, J.; Tang, W.; Zhang, L.; Zuo, J.; Jiang, H.; Bai, F.; Wu, Y.; Ye, Y.; Xu, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.038687v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.038687v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,False
87,ACE 2 Coding Variants: A Potential X-linked Risk Factor for COVID-19 Disease,"Viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected humans. Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date. Though we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.","Gibson, W.

88,Impact of Social Vulnerability on COVID-19 Incidence and Outcomes in the United States,"Importance: Prior pandemics have disparately affected socially vulnerable communities. Whether regional variations in social vulnerability to disasters influence COVID-19 outcomes and incidence in the U.S. is unknown. Objective: To examine the association of Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure of county-level social vulnerability to disasters, and its sub-components (socioeconomic status, household composition, minority status, and housing type/transportation accessibility) with the case fatality rate (CFR) and incidence of COVID-19. Design: Ecological study of counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 4th, 2020. Generalized linear mixed-effects models with state-level clustering were applied to estimate county-level associations of overall SVI and its sub-component scores with COVID-19 CFR (deaths/100 cases) and incidence (cases/1000 population), adjusting for population percentage aged >65 years, and for comorbidities using the average Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) score. Counties with high SVI ([&ge;]median) and high CFR ([&ge;]median) were identified. Setting: Population-based study of U.S. county-level data. Participants: U.S. counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Main outcomes and measures: COVID-19 CFR and incidence. Results: Data from 433 counties including 283,256 cases and 6,644 deaths were analyzed. Median SVI was 0.46 [Range: 0.01-1.00], and median CFR and incidence were 1.9% [Range: 0-13.3] and 1.2 per 1000 people [Range: 0.6-38.8], respectively. Higher SVI, indicative of greater social vulnerability, was associated with higher CFR (RR: 1.19 [1.05, 1.34], p=0.005, per-1% increase), an association that strengthened after adjustment for age>65 years and comorbidities (RR: 1.63 [1.38, 1.91], p<0.001), and was further confirmed in a sensitivity analysis limited to six states with the highest testing levels. Although the association between overall SVI and COVID-19 incidence was not significant, the SVI sub-components of socioeconomic status and minority status were both predictors of higher incidence and CFR. A combination of high SVI ([&ge;]0.46) and high adjusted CFR ([&ge;]2.3%) was observed in 28.9% of counties. Conclusions and Relevance: Social vulnerability is associated with higher COVID-19 case fatality. High social vulnerability and CFR coexist in more than 1 in 4 U.S. counties. These counties should be targeted by public policy interventions to help alleviate the pandemic burden on the most vulnerable population.","Nayak, A.; Islam, S. J.; Mehta, A.; Ko, Y.-A.; Patel, S.

Focusing on genes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, we observed an increase in the proportion of alveolar epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in adult compared to young lungs. Consistent with expression dynamics, 10 chromatin peaks linked to TMPRSS2 exhibited significantly increased activity with age and harbored IRF and STAT binding sites. Furthermore, we identified 14 common sequence variants in age-increasing peaks with predicted regulatory function, including several associated with respiratory traits and TMPRSS2 expression.

90,Human organs-on-chips as tools for repurposing approved drugs as potential influenza and COVID19 therapeutics in viral pandemics,"Rapidly spreading viral pandemics, such as those caused by influenza and SAR-CoV-2 (COVID19), require rapid action and the fastest way to combat this challenge is by repurposing existing drugs as anti-viral therapeutics. Here we first show that human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices lined by a highly differentiated, primary, human lung airway epithelium cultured under an air-liquid interface and fed by continuous medium flow can be used to model virus entry, replication, strain-dependent virulence, host cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection by influenza, as well as effects of existing and novel therapeutics. These Airway Chips, which contain human lung epithelial cells that express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were then used to assess the inhibitory activities of 7 clinically approved drugs (chloroquine, arbidol, toremifene, clomiphene, amodiaquine, verapamil, and amiodarone) that we found inhibit infection by viral pseudoparticles expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in human Huh-7 cells, and others recently showed suppress infection by native SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. However, when these drugs were administered under flow at the maximal concentration in blood reported in clinical studies in human Airway Chips, only two of these drugs - amodiaquine and toremifene - significantly inhibited entry of the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus. This work suggests that human Organ Chip technology may be used in conjunction with existing rapid cell-based screening assays to study human disease pathogenesis and expedite drug repurposing in biothreat crises caused by pandemic viruses.","Si, L.; Bai, H.; Rodas, M.; Cao, W.; Oh, C.

91,Analysis of factors associated early diagnosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Background The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the first concern in international affairs as the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading all over the world at a terrific speed. The accuracy of early diagnosis is critical in the control of the spread of the virus. Although the real-time RT-PCR detection of the virus nucleic acid is the current golden diagnostic standard, it has high false negative rate when only apply single test. Objective Summarize the baseline characteristics and laboratory examination results of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analyze the factors that could interfere with the early diagnosis quantitatively to support the timely confirmation of the disease. Methods All suspected patients with COVID-19 were included in our study until Feb 9th, 2020. The last day of follow-up was Mar 20th, 2020. Throat swab real-time RT-PCR test was used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. The difference between the epidemiological profile and first laboratory examination results of COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients were compared and analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) were used to assess the potential diagnostic value in factors, which had statistical differences in regression analysis. Results In total, 315 hospitalized patients were included. Among them, 108 were confirmed as COVID-19 patients and 207 were non-COVID-19 patients. Two groups of patients have significance in comparing age, contact history, leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.10). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, contact history and decreasing lymphocyte count could be used as individual factor that has diagnostic value (p<0.05). The AUC of first RT-PCR test was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.89), AUC of cumulative two times of RT-PCR tests was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for cumulative three times of RT-PCR tests. Ninety-six patients showed typical pneumonia radiological features in first CT scan, AUC was 0.74 (95% CI 0.60-0.73). The AUC of patients age, contact history with confirmed people and the decreased lymphocytes were 0.66 (95% CI 0.60-0.73), 0.67 (95% CI 0.61-0.73), 0.62 (95% CI 0.56-0.69), respectively. Taking chest CT scan diagnosis together with patients age and decreasing lymphocytes, AUC would be 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.90). The age threshold to predict COVID-19 was 41.5 years, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.79) and a specificity of 0.59 (95% CI 0.52-0.66). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.71 and 0.50, respectively. Threshold of lymphocyte count to diagnose COVID-19 was 1.53x109/L, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.88) and a specificity of 0.50 (95% CI 0.43-0.57). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.64 and 0.37, respectively. Conclusion Single RT-PCR test has relatively high false negative rate. When first RT-PCR test show negative result in suspected patients, the chest CT scan, contact history, age and lymphocyte count should be used combinedly to assess the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ai, J.; Gong, J.; Xing, L.; He, R.; Tian, F.; Wang, J.; Wang, J.; Pei, S.

92,A Scalable Method of Applying Heat and Humidity for Decontamination of N95 Respirators During the COVID-19 Crisis,"A lack of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 crisis has placed healthcare workers at risk. It is important for any N95 reuse strategy to determine the effects that proposed protocols would have on the physical functioning of the mask, as well as the practical aspects of implementation. Here we propose and implement a method of heating N95 respirators with moisture (85{degrees}C, 60-85% humidity). We test both mask filtration efficiency and fit to validate this process. Our tests focus on the 3M 1860 and 3M 8210 Plus N95 models. After five cycles of the heating procedure, both respirators pass quantitative fit testing (score of >100) and show no degradation of mask filtration efficiency. We also test the Chen Heng V9501 KN95 and HKYQ N95 finding no degradation of mask filtration efficiency, however even for unheated masks these scored <50 for every fit test. The heating method presented here is scalable from individual masks to over a thousand a day with a single industrial convection oven, making this method practical for local application inside health-care facilities.","Anderegg, L.; Meisenhelder, C.; Ngooi, C.

93,"COVID-19 in India: Predictions, Reproduction Number and Public Health Preparedness","Abstract Introduction: The COVID-19 has emerged as a global concern for public health due to large scale outbreak. The number of confirmed cases has also been increased in India in the past few weeks. The predictions for the COVID-19 can provide insights into the epidemiology of the disease, which helps policymakers to check health system capacities. Methods: We obtained data on daily confirmed, recovered and death cases for a period of 21 days and have implemented the exponential growth model to predict future cases for all the three components. The mathematical model was used to calculate the average reproduction number and herd immunity. We estimated the number of active cases till the 30th of April. We have also tried to analyze the public health capacity to combat COVID-19 in India. Results: If the exponential growth in the number of cases continues then the total number of active cases will be 2,49,635 until the end of April. The reproduction number for COVID-19 in India was found to be 2.56 and herd immunity as 61%. The cumulative cases predicted by the mathematical model was 1,20,203. Discussion: This prediction provides an alarming situation for India in terms of public health preparedness. The number of tests is needed to increase to detect all the cases of COVID-19 in India. Though some serious preventive measures have been implemented, but India should be ready to face any sudden community outbreak.

94,Efficacy of remdesivir versus placebo for the treatment of COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background: In spite of the global containment on prevention efforts, the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is continuing to rise, with 1.1 million confirmed cases and 60,124 deaths recorded worldwide since 04 April 2020. The outbreak has a significant threat to international health and economy. At present, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for the disease, while efforts are underway. Remdesivir, a nucleotide-analogue antiviral drug developed for Ebola, is determined to prevent and stop infections with COVID-19, while results are yet controversial. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of remdesivir and placebo in patients with COVID-19. Method and analysis: We will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar databases without restriction in year of publication. We will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of remdesivir versus placebo for patients confirmed with COVID-19. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Two independent authors will perform study selection, data extraction, and methodology quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. Random/fixed effect model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between remdesivir and placebo. Ethics and dissemination: This study does not require ethical approval, because no participants data will be involved in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The findings of this study will be published in reputable and peer-reviewed journal.

95,Comparative in vitro transcriptomic analyses of COVID-19 candidate therapy hydroxychloroquine suggest limited immunomodulatory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 host response genes.,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has emerged as a potential and controversial antiviral candidate therapy for COVID-19. While many clinical trials are underway to test the efficacy of HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of HCQ in the setting of COVID-19 remain unclear. Hence, we examined differential gene expression signatures of HCQ exposure, in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, and host signatures of COVID-19 in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and postmortem lung to evaluate whether HCQ transcriptome signatures associate with restoration of SARS-CoV-2-related host transcriptional responses. Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19+ patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQ-related transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants. These results may provide insight into the immunomodulation mechanisms of HCQ treatment in the setting of COVID-19 and suggest HCQ is not a panacea to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Corley, M.

96,"High-surety isothermal amplification and detection of SARS-CoV-2, including with crude enzymes","Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAT), such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are good alternatives to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification assays, especially for point-of-care and low resource use, in part because they can be carried out with relatively simple instrumentation. However, iNATs can generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets, and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false negative results. Internally redundant assays targeting different regions of the target sequence can help to reduce such false negatives. Here we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on non-sequence-specific readout into assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We evaluate one-pot operation of both individual and multiplex LAMP-OSD assays and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva.","Bhadra, S.; Riedel, T.

99,"New approximations, and policy implications, from a delayed dynamic model of a fast pandemic","We study an SEIQR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model for an infectious disease, with time delays for latency and an asymptomatic phase. For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show how correctly executed time-varying social distancing, within the present model, can cut the number of affected people by almost half. Alternatively, faster detection followed by near-certain quarantining can potentially be even more effective.","Vyasarayani, C.

101,"Estimating required lockdown cycles before immunity to SARS-CoV-2: Model-based analyses of susceptible population sizes, S0, in seven European countries including the UK and Ireland","Background: Following stringent social distancing measures, some European countries are beginning to report a slowed or negative rate of growth of daily case numbers testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The notion that the first wave of infection is close to its peak begs the question of whether future peaks or second waves are likely. We sought to determine the current size of the effective (i.e. susceptible) population for seven European countries - to estimate immunity levels following this first wave. We compare these numbers to the total population sizes of these countries, in order to investigate the potential for future peaks. Methods: We used Bayesian model inversion to estimate epidemic parameters from the reported case and death rates from seven countries using data from late January 2020 to April 5th 2020. Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical-systems implementation of a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and second: a partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model. Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population (S0), as well as epidemic parameters. Parameter estimation (data fitting) was performed using a standard Bayesian scheme (variational Laplace) designed to allow for latent unobservable states and uncertainty in model parameters. Results: Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates. The peaks of the current waves were predicted to be in the past for four countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland) and to emerge in 0.5-2 weeks in Ireland and 1-3 weeks in the UK. For France one model estimated the peak within the past week and the other in the future in two weeks. Crucially, Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models. Using for all countries, with a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6.4% of the total population would be immune. From the two models the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19.6% of the total population for the UK, 16.7% for Ireland, 11.4% for Italy, 12.8% for Spain, 18.8% for France, 4.7% for Germany and 12.9% for Switzerland. Conclusion: Our results indicate that after the current wave, a large proportion of the total population will remain without immunity. This suggests that in the absence of strong seasonal effects, new medications or more comprehensive contact tracing, a further set of epidemic waves in different geographic centres are likely. These findings may have implications for exit strategies from any lockdown stage.","Moran, R. J.; Fagerholm, E. D.; Daunizeau, J.; Cullen, M.; Richardson, M.

102,Chasing the ghost of infection past: identifying thresholds of change during the COVID-19 infection in Spain,"COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide rapidly from its first outbreak in China, with different impacts depending on the age and social structure of the populations, and the measures taken by each government. Within Europe, the first countries to be strongly affected have been Italy and Spain. In Spain, infection has expanded in highly populated areas, resulting in one of the largest nationwide bursts so far by early April. We analyze the evolution of the growth curve of the epidemic in both the whole of Spain and Madrid Autonomous Region (the second largest conurbation in Europe), based on the cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths. We conducted segmented, linear regressions on log-transformed data to identify changes in the slope of these curves and/or sudden shifts in the number of cases (i.e. changes in the intercept) at fitted breaking points, and compared their results with a timeline including both key events of the epidemic and containment measures taken by the national and regional governments. Results were largely consistent in the four curves analyzed (reported infections and deaths for Spain and Madrid, respectively), showing two major shifts in slopes (growth rates) at 14-15 and 26-29 March that resulted in 37-65% reductions of slope, and originated in infection on 4-5 and 16-18 March (for case detections) and 14-23 February and 5-6 March (for deaths). Small upward shifts in the progress of the disease in Madrid were not associated with significant changes in the intercept of the curve, and seem related with unevenness in case reporting. These results evidence an early deceleration in the spread of COVID-19 coinciding with personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations, as well as the general awareness of the population; and a second, stronger decrease when harder isolation measures were enforced. The combination of both breakpoints seemingly led to the start of the contention of the disease outbreak by early April, the limit of our time series. This highlights the importance of adopting public health strategies that include disseminating basic knowledge on personal hygiene and reduced social contact at the onset of the epidemic, and the importance of early enforcement of hard contention measures for its subsequent contention.","Santamaria, L.; Hortal, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059345v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059345v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
103,COVID-19 Global Pandemic Planning: Decontamination and Reuse Processes for N95 Respirators,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified as a cluster of respiratory illness in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread across the globe to greater than 200 countries. Healthcare providers are at an increased risk for contracting the disease due to occupational exposure and require appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators. The rapid worldwide spread of high numbers of COVID-19 cases has facilitated the need for a substantial supply of PPE that is largely unavailable in many settings, thereby creating critical shortages. Creative solutions for the decontamination and safe reuse of PPE to protect our frontline healthcare personnel are essential. Here, we describe the development of a process that began in late February 2020 for selecting and implementing the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) as viable method to reprocess N95 respirators. Since pre-existing HPV decontamination chambers were not available, we optimized the sterilization process in an operating room after experiencing initial challenges in other environments. Details are provided about the prioritization and implementation of processes for collection and storage, pre-processing, HPV decontamination, and post-processing of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Important lessons learned from this experience include, developing an adequate reserve of PPE for effective reprocessing and distribution, and identifying a suitable location with optimal environmental controls (i.e., operating room).

This limits large-scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and isolate infected individuals. Herein, we developed and evaluated multi-stage group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple stages. Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources. We used computer simulations to assess and compare their efficiency for various prevalence rates. We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many people with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively. We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate. These group testing schemes could lead to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large-scale population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Eberhardt, J.

105,"Clinical features and management of severe COVID-19: A retrospective study in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China","Objective: We aimed to investigate clinical features and management of 55 COVID-19 patients in Wuxi, especially severe COVID-19. Methods: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, treatment, and outcome data of patients were collected. Follow-up lasted until April 6, 2020. Results: All 55 patients included 47 (85.5%) non-severe patients and 8 (14.5%) severe patients. Common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes. Common symptoms were fever, cough and sputum. Lymphopenia was a common laboratory finding, and ground-glass opacity was a common chest CT feature. All patients received antiviral therapy of -interferon inhalation and lopinavir-ritonavir tablets. Common complications included acute liver injury and respiratory failure. All patients were discharged. No death was occurred and no medical staff got infected. Patients with severe COVID-19 showed significantly older age, decreased lymphocytes, increased C reactive protein, and higher frequency of bilateral lung infiltration compared to non-severe patients. Significantly more treatments including antibiotic therapy and mechanical ventilation, longer hospitalization stay and higher cost were shown on severe patients. Conclusions: Our study suggested that patients with severe COVID-19 may be more likely to have an older age, present with lymphopenia and bilateral lung infiltration, receive multiple treatments and stay longer in hospital.","Jiang, X.; Tao, J.; Wu, H.; Wang, Y.; Zhao, W.; Zhou, M.; Huang, J.; You, Q.; Meng, H.; Zhu, F.; Zhang, X.; Qian, M.; Qiu, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060335v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060335v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
106,"COVID-19 pandemics modeling with SEIR(+CAQH), social distancing, and age stratification. The effect of vertical confinement and release in Brazil.","As the COVID-19 epidemic rages, the total number of cases and deaths is raising across the world. This is certainly a challenging situation particularly for countries in a perilous socio-economic situation. With the rapid evolution of the disease, once introduced, making decisions becomes challenging particularly when past experience or data are not so relevant. This is when mathematical models could come handy to predict the evaluations of the epidemic. We designed a modified SEIR-type mathematical model which we assessed with up-to-date data of COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world, and in which the rate of transmission is derived from the observed delayed fatality rate. We used Brazil as an example for middle income countries and applied our model to the Brazilian context. We implement age stratification, horizontal confinement followed by a ""vertical confinement"" exit strategy.","Lyra, W.; do Nascimento, J. D.; Belkhiria, J.; de Almeida, L.; Chrispim, P.

Identifying the last trend of exponential growth, mainly noticed in month of March, we have zoomed in its disaster possibilities by straight forward extrapolation of exponential growth. As a hopeful extrapolation, the existing data might be considered low time-axis values of Sigmoid-type function, whose growth might be saturated to values of 10^4 or 10^5. To fulfill this expectation, a turning from increasing to decreasing trend in new case data should be noticed around April-May, which definitely demand extension of present lock-down with additional interventions.","MONDAL, S.; Ghosh, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060442v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060442v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
108,Scaling diagnostics in times of COVID-19: Rapid prototyping of 3D-printed water circulators for Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) and detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus,"By the first week of April 2020, more than 1,500,000 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 50,000 deaths had been officially reported worldwide. While developed countries such as the USA, Italy, England, France, Spain, and Germany struggle to mitigate the propagation of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Latin America, India, and Africa -territories in which the mounted infrastructure for diagnosis is greatly underdeveloped. An actual epidemic emergency does not provide the required timeframe for testing new diagnostic strategies; therefore, the first line of response must be based on commercially and readily available resources. Here, we demonstrate the combined use of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed incubation chamber for commercial Eppendorf PCR tubes, and a colorimetric embodiment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction scheme for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. We used this strategy to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences using a set of in-house designed initiators that target regions encoding the N protein. We were able to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of ~625 to 2 X 105 DNA copies by this straightforward method. The accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostics strategy may provide a cost-efficient and reliable alternative for use during the COVID-19 pandemics, particularly in underdeveloped regions were the availability of RT-qPCR instruments may be limited. Moreover, the portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of this strategy make it a reliable alternative for deployment of point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection efforts during the pandemics.","Gonzalez-Gonzalez, E.; Lara-Mayorga, I.

109,"COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent: forecasts of cumulative cases, new infections, and mortality","Background: Africa is the last major region to capitulate to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the region was reported on February 14, but what lies ahead in terms of the course and magnitude of infection remains speculative. To the best of our knowledge, no study, using a robust methodology, provides the immediate and long-term trajectory of COVID-19 for the entire region or accounts for its local context. This paper is the first systematic attempt to provide estimates on how many people would contract the virus and how many would die in the coming few months across Africa. Methods: The forecasts on caseloads and incidences are from a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression model. Fatality rates from Italy and China were further applied to generate mortality estimates after adjustments were made for differences in age-structure, health service quality, and living standards between each of the African countries and those of the reference population. We cover all countries that reported a confirmed case as of March 31, 2020. Results: By the end of June, 16,283,085 people will contract COVID-19 (95% CI 718,403 to 98, 358, 799). With a cumulative caseload of 5,413,4517 (95% CI 1,332,953 to 8,489,940) and 906,625 (95% CI 173, 821 to 4,742,917) Northern and Eastern Africa will respectively be the most and least affected sub-regions in the continent. Cumulative COVID-19 cases on June 30, 2020 are expected to reach 2,912, 864 (95% CI 465,028 to 18,286,358) in Southern Africa, 2,787, 913 (95% CI 517, 489 to 15,056,314) in Western Africa, and 1,185,742 (95% CI 229, 111 to 6,138,692) in Central Africa. New infections (incidence) for the month of April are expected to be the highest in Djibouti, 32.8 per 1000 (95% CI 6.25 to 171.77), while Morocco 1045 (95% CI 167 to 6,547) will register the highest number of deaths. Conclusion: Our study shows that countries that are least urbanized and have a low level of socio-economic development, hence least connected to the outside world, are likely to register lower and slower transmissions, at least at the early stage of the epidemic. However, the same set of enabling factors that worked for their benefit are likely to go against them in implementing interventions that have lessened the impact of the disease elsewhere.","Kinfu, Y.; Alam, U.; Achoki, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059154v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059154v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
110,Comparison of different exit scenarios from the lock-down for COVID-19 epidemic in the UK and assessing uncertainty of the predictions,"We model further development of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK given the current data and assuming different scenarios of handling the epidemic. In this research, we further extend the stochastic model suggested in [1] and incorporate in it all available to us knowledge about parameters characterising the behaviour of the virus and the illness induced by it. The models we use are flexible, comprehensive, fast to run and allow us to incorporate the following: - time-dependent strategies of handling the epidemic; - spatial heterogeneity of the population and heterogeneity of development of epidemic in different areas; - special characteristics of particular groups of people, especially people with specific medical pre-histories and elderly. Standard epidemiological models such as SIR and many of its modifications are not flexible enough and hence are not precise enough in the studies that requires the use of the features above. Decision-makers get serious benefits from using better and more flexible models as they can avoid of nuanced lock-downs, better plan the exit strategy based on local population data, different stages of the epidemic in different areas, making specific recommendations to specific groups of people; all this resulting in a lesser impact on economy, improved forecasts of regional demand upon NHS allowing for intelligent resource allocation.","Zhigljavsky, A.; Whitaker, R.; Fesenko, I.; Kremnitzer, Y.; Noonan, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059451v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059451v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
111,Global COVID-19 transmission rate is influenced by precipitation seasonality and the speed of climate temperature warming,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a rapidly spreading worldwide epidemic; thus, it is a global priority to reduce the speed of the epidemic spreading. Several studies predicted that high temperature and humidity could reduce COVID-19 transmission. However, exceptions exist to this observation, further thorough examinations are thus needed for their confirmation. In this study, therefore, we used a global dataset of COVID-19 cases and global climate databases and comprehensively investigated how climate parameters could contribute to the growth rate of COVID-19 cases while statistically controlling for potential confounding effects using spatial analysis. We also confirmed that the growth rate decreased with the temperature; however, the growth rate was affected by precipitation seasonality and warming velocity rather than temperature. In particular, a lower growth rate was observed for a higher precipitation seasonality and lower warming velocity. These effects were independent of population density, human life quality, and travel restrictions. The results indicate that the temperature effect is less important compared to these intrinsic climate characteristics, which might thus be useful for explaining the exceptions. However, the contributions of the climate parameters to the growth rate were moderate; rather, the contribution of travel restrictions in each country was more significant. Although our findings are preliminary owing to data-analysis limitations, they may be helpful when predicting COVID-19 transmission.","Chiyomaru, K.; Takemoto, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060459v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060459v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True

114,Molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs and traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19: A systematic review,"The emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic has resulted in the need for urgent development of vaccines and drugs and the conduction of clinical trials to fight the outbreak. Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease. The research articles or grey literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from 4 databases and 1 search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about 6 drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and 3 traditional Chinese medicines (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) were extracted. All of the drug treatment options depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas traditional Chinese medicine has a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

115,Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as markers of disease severity in COVID-19,"In severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), viral pneumonia progresses to respiratory failure. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis, including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 (n=50 patients, n=84 samples) have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase(MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter two are highly specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro. In summary, these data reveal high levels of NETs in many patients with COVID-19, where they may contribute to cytokine release and respiratory failure. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts, and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.","Zuo, Y.; Yalavarthi, S.; Shi, H.; Gockman, K.; Zuo, M.; Madison, J.

117,"Stability of the COVID-19 virus under wet, dry and acidic conditions","COVID-19 has become a pandemic and is spreading fast worldwide. The COVID-19 virus is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. However, the fecal-oral transmission of the virus has not been ruled out and it is important to ascertain how acidic condition in the stomach affects the infectivity of the virus. Besides, it is unclear how stable the COVID-19 virus is under dry and wet conditions. In the present study, we have shown that the COVID-19 virus is extremely infectious as manifested by the infection of Vero-E6 cells by one PFU (Plaque Forming Unit) of the virus. We then investigated the stability of the COVID-19 virus in wet, dry and acidic (pH2.2) environments at room temperature. Results showed that the COVID-19 virus could survive for three days in wet and dry environments, but the dry condition is less favorable for the survival of the virus. Our study also demonstrated that the COVID-19 virus at a relative high titer (1.2 x 103 PFU) exhibits a certain degree of tolerance to acidic environment at least for 60 minutes. When the virus titer was [&le;]1.0 x 103 PFU, acid treatment (pH2.2) for 30 or 60 minute resulted in virus inactivation.

We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model---which minimizes the expected harm of false positives and false negatives---to optimize the clinical trial development path during such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static R0=2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic R0 ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively.

Design: Observational, descriptive study of ICUs monitored by a tele-ICU system across Northwell Health. Inclusion criteria: All patients admitted to Northwell Health tele-ICUs during 2019 and between March 23, 2020 and April 6, 2020. Exposure: A data extract was developed to collect data every hour for each ICU bed in the Northwell tele-critical care program as a quality reporting initiative to understand ICU capacity and resource utilization. A similar extract was developed for each hour of 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average of any given hour during the pre-COVID-19 and pandemic periods for the following metrics: proportion of beds occupied, proportion of ventilated patients, severity of illness (measured by the ICU Discharge Readiness Score (DRS)), and length of stay (LOS). Results: Hourly analysis of data from 186 ICU beds from 14 ICUs and 9 hospitals were included, representing 10,714 patients in 2019 and 465 patients between March 23 and April 6, 2020. Average hourly occupancy increased from 64% to 78%, while the proportion of patients invasively ventilated increased from 33.9% to 84.2%.

Adapting the classical SEIR- type epidemic modelling framework, the direct person-to-person contact transmission is taken as the direct route of transmission of nCOVID-19 pandemic. In this research, the authors have developed a model of the nation-wide trends of the outburst of the nCOVID-19 infection using an SEIR Model. The SEIR dynamics are expressed using ordinary differential equations. The creators initially determined the parameters of the model from the accessible day by day information for Indian States dependent on around 35 days history of diseases, recuperation and deaths. The determined parameters have been amassed to extend future patterns for the Indian subcontinent, which is right now at a beginning time in the contamination cycle. The novelty of the study lies in the prediction of both the pessimistic and optimistic mathematical model based comprehensive analysis of nCOVID-19 infection spreading, for two different conditions: (a) if lock down gets withdrawn and (b) if lock down continues as a whole. If the complete lock down in India is withdrawn on 14th April 2020, as a whole, then from the simulation, the authors have predicted that the infected population will flare-up to a large extent , suddenly, however, gradual or zone specific withdrawal would be more effective solution. This study also suggested some possible way-out to get rid of this situation by providing a trade-off between ""flattening of the curve"" as well as less economic turbulence. The projections are intended to provide a base/ action plan for the socio-economic counter measures to alleviate nCOVID-19.","Biswas, S.; Mukherjee, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060830v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060830v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
122,Preliminary study to identify severe from moderate cases of COVID-19 using NLR&RDW-SD combination parameter,"Objectives: Investigate the characteristics and rules of hematology changes in patients with COVID-19, and explore the possibility to identify moderate and severe patients using conventional hematology parameters or combined parameters. Methods: The clinical data of 45 moderate and severe type patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections in Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 13, 2020 were collected. The epidemiological indexes, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. Those parameters with significant differences between the two groups were analyzed, and the combination parameters with best diagnostic performance were selected using the LDA method. Results: Of the 45 patients with COVID-19 (35 moderate and 10 severe cases), 23 were male and 22 female, aged 16-62 years. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (89%) and dry cough (60%). As the disease progressed, WBC, Neu#, NLR, PLR, RDW-CV and RDW-SD parameters in the severe group were significantly higher than that in the moderate group (P<0.05); meanwhile, Lym#, Eos#, HFC%, RBC, HGB and HCT parameters in the severe group were significantly lower than that in the moderate group (P<0.05). For NLR, the AUC, the best cut-off value, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.890, 13.39, 83.3% and 82.4% respectively, and for PLR , the AUC, the best cut-off, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.842, 267.03, 83.3% and 74.0% respectively. The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD had the best diagnostic efficiency (AUC was 0.938) and when the cut-off value was 1.046, the sensitivity and the specificity were 90.0% and 84.7% respectively, followed by the fitting parameter NLR&RDW-CV (AUC = 0.923). When the cut-off value was 0.62, the sensitivity and the specificity for distinguishing severe type from moderate cases of COVID-19 were 90.0% and 82.4% respectively. Conclusions: The combined parameter NLR&RDW-SD is the best hematology index and can help clinicians to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients, and it can be used as a useful indicator to help prevent and control the epidemic.","wang, c.; Li, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058594v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058594v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
123,The first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in 46 sub-Saharan African countries; a comparative analysis of growth rates,"Background The COVID-19 outbreak in sub-Saharan African countries started after those in Asia, Europe and North America, on 28th February 2020. The susceptibility to infection of populations in that region has been debated. Outbreaks on the scale of those seen elsewhere would pose substantial challenges. There are reasons for concern that transmission may be high and difficult to control, rapidly exceeding capacity to meet the needs for hospitalization and critical care. Methods We obtained data on daily new confirmed cases for all 46 countries from the World Health Organization, and used these to model and visualize growth trajectories using an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. We then estimated doubling times from growth rates estimated from Poisson regression models, and by back counting from the most recent observation. We also calculated the time from 1st to 50th case, and the time from 5th to 100th case. These indicators were compared with the same summary indicators of growth at the same stage of the outbreak in highly affected European countries. Results Kenya was the only country with clear evidence of exponential growth. Nineteen countries had either reported no cases, were in the first few days of the outbreak, or had reported fewer than 10 cases over a period of two or more weeks. For the remaining 27 countries we identified four growth patterns: slow linear growth, more rapid linear growth, variable growth patterns over the course of the outbreak, and early signs of possible exponential growth. For those in the last three groups, doubling times ranged from 3 to 4 days, times from 1st to 50th case from 12 to 29 days, and from 5th to 100th case from eight to 15 days. These early indicators are comparable to those in European countries that have gone on to have substantial outbreaks, and time to 50th case was shorter suggesting lesser effectiveness of contact-tracing and quarantine in the early phase. Conclusion The 46 sub-Saharan African countries, home to over one billion people, are at a tipping point with clear potential for the outbreak to follow a similar course as in HIC in the global north. Radical population-level physical distancing measures may be required, but their impact on poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable people and communities need mitigating. Health systems in the region need urgent technical and material support, with testing, personal protection, and hospital/ critical care.","Prince, M.

124,Immunological assays for SARS-CoV-2: an analysis of available commercial tests to measure antigen and antibodies,"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection has led to the development of molecular and serologic tests in a short period of time. While tests such as RT-PCR have applications in the immediate diagnosis revealing the presence of the virus, serological tests can be used to determine previous exposure to the virus and complement acute diagnosis. Antibody production can occur as early as 5 days post-infection. Both IgM and IgG specific anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies can be a useful tool to test faster and larger groups of individuals. The objective of this study was to carry out a review of the different serological tests offered to detect antigen or antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This information should be useful for decision takers in different countries to choose a test according to their needs. Based on web pages that listed serological assays, we found 226 coming from 20 countries, the majority are indirect tests for specific antibodies detection (n 180) and use immunochromatography methods (n 110) with samples coming from blood-derived products (n 105). Measuring IgM/IgG at the same time (n 112) and a procedure time of <20 min (n 83) are the most common. The overall average sensitivity was 91.8% and specificity was 97%. Most of the tests are currently for in vitro diagnosis (IVD). This information gathered could change day by day due to the expedite process of production and emergency of authorization use.","Gonzalez, J. M.; Shelton, J.

125,"Hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial","Abstract Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus standard-of-care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in adult patients with COVID-19. Design Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting 16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants 150 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 were assigned to SOC alone (control group). Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measures The primary endpoint was the 28-day negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2. The assessed secondary endpoints were negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21, the improvement rate of clinical symptoms within 28-day, normalization of C-reactive protein and blood lymphocyte count within 28-day. Primary and secondary analysis was by intention to treat. Adverse events were assessed in the safety population. Results The overall 28-day negative conversion rate was not different between SOC plus HCQ and SOC group (Kaplan-Meier estimates 85.4% versus 81.3%, P=0.341). Negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21 was also similar between the two groups. No different 28-day symptoms alleviation rate was observed between the two groups. A significant efficacy of HCQ on alleviating symptoms was observed when the confounding effects of anti-viral agents were removed in the post-hoc analysis (Hazard ratio, 8.83, 95%CI, 1.09 to 71.3). This was further supported by a significantly greater reduction of CRP (6.986 in SOC plus HCQ versus 2.723 in SOC, milligram/liter, P=0.045) conferred by the addition of HCQ, which also led to more rapid recovery of lymphopenia, albeit no statistical significance. Adverse events were found in 8.8% of SOC and 30% of HCQ recipients with two serious adverse events. The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea (10%). Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a higher negative conversion rate but more alleviation of clinical symptoms than SOC alone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without receiving antiviral treatment, possibly through anti-inflammatory effects. Adverse events were significantly increased in HCQ recipients but no apparently increase of serious adverse events.

Limited data are available characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States. Objective: To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care. Exposures: Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index). Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values. Results: Among Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95% CI 3.79-5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.89-3.46). In adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] >3.25 OR 8.73, 95% CI 4.11-18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.43-1.84) were strongly associated with hospitalization. Associations were similar for intensive care. Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance: Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.","Rentsch, C.

127,Do latitude and ozone concentration predict Covid-2019 cases in 34 countries?,"In this paper, I used multivariate linear regression analysis to determine if latitude and ozone concentration predict Covid-2019 cases in 34 countries worldwide. Data pertaining to Covid-2019 cases were extracted from Worldometer. Ozone concentration levels were taken from the open-access database of World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Latitude of specific area where measurement took place was also provided in the database. Preliminary Kendall rank correlation test revealed that Covid-2019 incidence was positively and significantly related to ozone concentration; however, incidence was not significantly related to latitude. Using multivariate linear regression, a statistically significant link between ozone concentration and Covid-2019 incidence in 34 countries was established; however, I found no statistical association between latitude and Covid-2019 incidence refuting previous claims. Prompt health actions should be developed for areas with high ozone concentration in the present and possibly, future outbreaks; however, extensive laboratory analysis should be conducted to further confirm the findings of the study. Nevertheless, the results of this study could serve as a basis for further clinical and large-scale studies.","Alipio, M.

128,Should contact bans be lifted in Germany? A quantitative prediction of its effects,"Many countries consider the lifting of restrictions of social contacts (RSC). We quantify the effects of RSC for Germany. We initially employ a purely statistical approach to predicting prevalence of COVID19 if RSC were upheld after April 20. We employ these findings and feed them into our theoretical model. We find that the peak of the number of sick individuals would be reached already by mid-April. The number of sick individuals would fall below 1,000 at the beginning of July. When restrictions are lifted completely on April 20, the number of sick should rise quickly again from around April 27. A balance between economic and individual costs of RSC and public health objectives consists in lifting RSC for activities that have high economic benefits but low health costs. In the absence of large-scale representative testing of CoV-2 infections, these activities can most easily be identified if federal states of Germany adopted exit strategies that differ across states.","Donsimoni, J.

129,"Associations of clinical characteristics and antiviral drugs with viral RNA clearance in patients with COVID-19 in Guangzhou, China: a retrospective cohort study","Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterized by respiratory symptoms has become a global pandemic although factors influencing viral RNA clearance remained unclear to inform optimal isolation period and treatment strategies. Methods: In this retrospective study, we included patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from 20th January 2020 to 15th March 2020. The associations of clinical characteristics and treatment regimens on time to viral RNA clearance were analyzed. Results: We examined 284 consecutive COVID-19 cases, accounting for 82% of confirmed cases in Guangzhou during this period. At the time of reporting (20th March 2020), 276 (97.2%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital with a median hospital stay of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR]:13-24). Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66.1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89.3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA even after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: In patients with COVID-19, isolation for a minimum of 21 days after onset of illness may be warranted, while the use of antiviral drugs does not enhance viral RNA clearance.","Chen, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zhu, B.; Zeng, J.; Hong, W.; He, X.; Chen, J.; Zheng, H.; Qiu, S.; Deng, Y.; Chan, J.; Wang, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058941v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058941v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
130,An agent-based epidemic model REINA for COVID-19 to identify destructive policies,"Background. Countries have adopted disparate policies in tackling the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. For example, China closed down large areas almost completely to increase social distance; South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts; and many European countries try to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies, i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and that should not be implemented. Methods. We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population in time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available at each time point. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online. Results. The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). Two main scenarios were tested with several variants. The first, a mitigation strategy, aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. The other, a suppression strategy, consists of the same mobility restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their contacts. Both take as their starting point the actual situation as of 2020-04-06. The default mitigation scenario with variable 30-40% mobility reduction appears able to delay the peak of the epidemic (as intended) but not to suppress the disease. In the suppression strategy, active testing and tracing of patients with symptoms and their contacts is implemented in addition to 20-25% mobility reduction. This results in a reduction during the first year of the cumulative number infected individuals from 820 000 to 80 000 and the number of deaths from 6000 to only 640, when compared with the mitigation strategy. Discussion. The agent-based model (REINA) can be used to simulate epidemic outcomes of various types of policy actions on a timeline. Our results lend support to the strategy of combining comprehensive testing, contact tracing and targeted isolation measures with social isolation measures. While latter are important in the early stages to prevent explosive growth, the mitigation strategy aiming to slow down the epidemic mainly via social isolation appears to be a destructive policy, i.e. a policy that has, based on scientific knowledge, better alternatives. The open-source nature of the model facilitates rapid further development. The flexibility of the modelling logic supports the future implementation of several already identified refinements in terms of more realistic population model and new types of more specific policy interventions. Improving estimates of epidemic parameters will make it possible to improve modelling accuracy further.","Tuomisto, J.

131,"Comparative Analysis of COVID-19 Transmission Patterns in Three Chinese Regions vs. South Korea,Italy and Iran","Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) began in January 2020 in the city of Wuhan (Hubei province, China). It took about 2 months for China to get this infectious disease under control in its epicenter at Wuhan. Since February 2020, COVID-19 has been spreading around the world, becoming widespread in a number of countries. The timing and nature of government actions in response to the pandemic has varied from country to country, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. Method: The present study proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model to perform a comparative analysis of the temporal progress of disease spread in six regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). For each region we developed detailed timelines of reported infections and outcomes, along with government-implemented measures to enforce social distancing. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Results: The main results of this study are as follows: (a) an empirical COVID-19 growth law provides an excellent fit to the disease data in all study regions and potentially could be of more general validity; (b) significant differences exist in the spread characteristics of the disease among the three regions of China and between the three regions of China and the three countries; (c) under the control measures implemented in the Chinese regions (including the immediate quarantine of infected patients and their close contacts, and considerable restrictions on social contacts), the transmission rate of COVID-19 followed a modified normal distribution function, and it reached its peak after 1 to 2 days and then was reduced to zero 11, 11 and 18 days after a 1st-Level Response to Major Public Health Emergency was declared in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang, respectively; moreover, the epidemic control times in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang showed that the epidemic reached an ""inflection point"" after 9, 12 and 17 days, respectively, after a 1st-Level Response was issued; (d) an empirical COVID-19 law provided an excellent fit to the disease data in the six study regions, and the law can be potentially of more general validity; and (e) the curves of infected cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been significantly flattened and shrunken at a relatively earlier stage of the epidemic if similar preventive measures as in the Chinese regions had been also taken in the above three countries on February 25th, February 25th and March 8th, respectively: the simulated maximum number of infected individuals in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been 4480 cases (March 9th, 2020), 2335 cases (March 10th) and 6969 cases (March 20th), instead of the actual (reported) numbers of 7212 cases (March 9th), 8514 cases (March 10th, 2020) and 11466 cases (March 20th), respectively; moreover, up to March 29th, the simulated reduction in the accumulated number of infected cases would be 1585 for South Korea, 93490 for Italy and 23213 for Iran, respectively, accounting for 16.41% (South Korea), 95.70% (Italy) and 60.59% (Iran) of the accumulated number of actual reported infected cases. Conclusions: The implemented measures in China were very effective for controlling the spread of COVID-19. These measures should be taken as early as possible, including the early identification of all infection sources and eliminating transmission pathways. Subsequently, the number of infected cases can be controlled at a low level, and existing medical resources could be sufficient for maintaining higher cure rates and lower mortality rate compared to the current situations in these countries. The proposed model can account for these prevention and control measures by properly adjusting its parameters, it computes the corresponding variations in disease transmission rate during the outbreak period, and it can provide valuable information for public health decision-making purposes.","He, J.; Chen, G.; Jiang, Y.; Jin, R.; He, M.; Shortridge, A.; Wu, J.; Christakos, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20053223v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20053223v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
132,Excess cases of influenza suggest an earlier start to the coronavirus epidemic in Spain than official figures tell us: an analysis of primary care electronic medical records from over 6 million people from Catalonia,"Objectives: There is uncertainty about when the first cases of COVID-19 appeared in Spain, as asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus. We aimed to determine whether influenza diagnoses masked early COVID-19 cases and, if so, estimate numbers of undetected COVID-19 cases in a large database of primary-care records covering >6 million people in Catalonia. Design: Time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases, using all influenza seasons from autumn-winter 2010-2011 to autumn-winter 2019-2020. Setting: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain. Participants: People registered in one of the contributing primary-care practices, covering >6 million people and >85% of the population. Main outcome measures: Weekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 diagnosed in primary care. Analyses: Daily counts of both cases were computed using the total cases recorded over the previous 7 days to avoid weekly effects on recording practice. Epidemic curves were characterised for the 2010-2011 to 2019-2020 influenza seasons. Influenza seasons with a similar epidemic curve and peak case number as the 2019-2020 season were used to model predictions for 2019-2020. ARIMA models were fitted to the included influenza seasons, overall and stratified by age, to estimate expected case numbers. Daily excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases. Results: Four influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2016-2017) were used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020. Between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 20202, 8,017 (95% CI: 1,841 to 14,718) excess influenza cases were identified. This excess was highest in the 15-64 age group. Conclusions: COVID-19 cases may have been present in the Catalan population when the first imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. COVID-19 carriers may have been misclassified as influenza diagnoses in primary care, boosting community transmission before public health measures were taken. In future, the surveillance of excess influenza cases using widely available primary-care electronic medical records could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 or other influenza-like illness-causing pathogens. Earlier detection would allow public health responses to be initiated earlier than during the current crisis.","Coma, E.; Mora, N.; Prats-Uribe, A.; Fina, F.; Prieto-Alhambra, D.; Medina-Peralta, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20056259v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20056259v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
133,Pulmonary radiological change of COVID-19 patients with 99mTc-MDP treatment,"Background: As increasing cases of COVID-19 around world, urgent need for effective COVID-19-specific therapeutic drugs is necessary; therefore, we conducted a pilot randomized-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of 99mTc-MDP for COVID-19 therapeutic treatment. Methods: A total of 21 mild patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this pilot RCT from February 2020 through March 2020, and then were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, into control (11 patients) and 99mTc-MDP group (10 patients). Patients in the control group received routine treatment and patients assigned to the 99mTc-MDP group received a combination of routine treatment and an administration of 99mTc-MDP injection of 5ml/day. Both of the patients in the control and 99mTc-MDP groups were treated for 7 days with the primary end point of CT-based radiological pulmonary changes during 7-day follow-up. Findings: From baseline to the day 7, 8 (80%) of 10 mild patients in the 99mTc-MDP group had a significant radiological improvement in lung and a decline in inflammatory infiltration, whereas only 1 (9.1%) of 11 patients in the control group had a radiological improvement in lung. None of the patients in the 99mTc-MDP group had disease progression from mild to severe, as well as an inflammatory cytokine storm, and 2 mild patients (18.2%) in the control group developed severe. During days 7 through 14, the number of patients with radiological improvement in the 99mTc-MDP group remained consistent, and only 1 additional case (22%) in the control group were reported. Conclusion: In this randomized pilot study, 99mTc-MDP had an effective inhibitory effect on the inflammatory disease progression for the therapy of COVID-19, and it can accelerate the absorption of pulmonary inflammation in a short period of time during the process of treatment.","Yuan, X.; Yi, W.; Liu, B.; Tian, S.; Cao, F.; Wang, R.; Qi, B.; Lu, F.; Fang, M.; Pei, F.; Chen, M.; Zhang, L.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, X.; Pan, Z.; Zhao, D.; Yu, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20054767v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20054767v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
134,COVID-19 most vulnerable Mexican cities lack the public health infrastructure to face the pandemic: a new temporally-explicit model,"Recently, a wide array of epidemiological models has been developed to guide public health actors in containing the rapid dissemination of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause of COVID-19. Despite their usefulness, many epidemiological models recently developed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and infection rates of COVID-19 fall short as they ignore human mobility, limiting our understanding of the spread of the disease, together with the vulnerability of population centers in a broad scale. We developed a new temporally-explicit model and simulated several social distancing scenarios to predict the vulnerability to COVID-19 of 50 Mexican cities that are interconnected by their air transportation network. Additionally, we assessed the sufficiency of the public health infrastructure in the focal cities to face the pandemic over time. Based on our model, we show that the most important cities within the Mexican air transportation network are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, with all assessed public health infrastructure being insufficient to face the modeled scenario for the pandemic after 100 days. Despite these alarming findings, our results show that social distancing could dramatically decrease the total number of infected people (77% drop-off for the 45% distancing scenario when contrasted with no distancing), flattening the growth of infection rate. Thus, we consider that this study provides useful information that may help decision-makers to timely implement health policies to anticipate and lessen the impact of the current pandemic in Mexico.","Dattilo, W.; Silva, A.

135,"ACE inhibition and cardiometabolic risk factors, lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression, and plasma ACE2 levels: a Mendelian randomization study","Objectives: To use human genetic variants that proxy angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug effects and cardiovascular risk factors to provide insight into how these exposures affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression and circulating ACE2 levels. Design: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Setting: Summary-level genetic association data. Participants: Participants were predominantly of European ancestry. Variants that proxy ACE inhibitor drug effects and cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lifetime smoking index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus) were selected from publicly available genome-wide association study data (sample sizes ranging from 188,577 to 898,130 participants). Genetic association estimates for lung expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were obtained from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (515 participants) and the Lung eQTL Consortium (1,038 participants). Genetic association estimates for circulating plasma ACE2 levels were obtained from the INTERVAL study (4,947 participants). Main outcomes and measures: Lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and plasma ACE2 levels. Results: There were no association of genetically proxied ACE inhibition with any of the outcomes considered here. There was evidence of a positive association of genetic liability to type 2 diabetes mellitus with lung ACE2 gene expression in GTEx (p = 4x10-4) and with circulating plasma ACE2 levels in INTERVAL (p = 0.03), but not with lung ACE2 expression in the Lung eQTL Consortium study (p = 0.68). There were no associations between genetically predicted levels of the other cardiometabolic traits with the outcomes. Conclusions: This study does not provide evidence to support that ACE inhibitor antihypertensive drugs affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression or plasma ACE2 levels. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, our findings do not support a change in ACE inhibitor medication use without clinical justification.","Gill, D.; Arvanitis, M.; Carter, P.; Hernandez Cordero, A.

136,Calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate is associated with reduced case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with hypertension,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread to more than 100 countries posing as a serious threat to the public health on a global scale. Patients with comorbidity such as hypertension suffer more severe infection with elevated case fatality rate. Development of effective anti-viral drug is in urgent need to treat COVID-19 patients. Here we report that calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a type of anti-hypertension drugs that are widely used in the clinics, can significantly inhibit the post-entry replication events of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Comparison with two other major types of anti-hypertension drugs, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), showed that only CCBs display significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Combined treatment with chloroquine and CCBs significantly enhanced the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Retrospective clinical investigation of COVID-19 patients revealed that the CCB amlodipine besylate administration distinctly reduced the case fatality rate of patients with hypertension. Results from this study suggest that CCB administration for COVID-19 patients with hypertension as the comorbidity might improve the disease outcome.","Zhang, L.; Sun, Y.; Zeng, H.-L.; Peng, Y.; Jiang, X.; Shang, W.-J.; Wu, Y.; Li, S.; Zhang, Y.-L.; Yang, L.; Chen, H.; Jin, R.; Liu, W.; Li, H.; Peng, K.; Xiao, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20047134v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20047134v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
137,COVID-19: Recovering estimates of the infected fatality rate during an ongoing pandemic through partial data,"In an ongoing epidemic, the case fatality rate is not a reliable estimate of a disease's severity. This is particularly so when a large share of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients escape testing, or when overwhelmed healthcare systems are forced to limit testing further to severe cases only. By leveraging data on COVID-19, we propose a novel way to estimate a disease's infected fatality rate, the true lethality of the disease, in the presence of sparse and partial information. We show that this is feasible when the disease has turned into a pandemic and data comes from a large number of countries, or regions within countries, as long as testing strategies vary sufficiently. For Italy, our method estimates an IFR of 1.1% (95% CI: 0.2% - 2.1%), which is strongly in line with other methods. At the global level, our method estimates an IFR of 1.6% (95% CI: 1.1% - 2.1%).

138,No evidence of clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with oxygen requirement: results of a study using routinely collected data to emulate a target trial,"Background Treatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received worldwide attention because of positive results from small studies. Methods We used data collected from routine care of all adults in 4 French hospitals with documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and requiring oxygen [&ge;] 2 L/min to emulate a target trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of HCQ at 600 mg/day. The composite primary endpoint was transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) within 7 days from inclusion and/or death from any cause. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results This study included 181 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; 84 received HCQ within 48 hours of admission (HCQ group) and 97 did not (no-HCQ group). Initial severity was well balanced between the groups. In the weighted analysis, 20.2% patients in the HCQ group were transferred to the ICU or died within 7 days vs 22.1% in the no-HCQ group (16 vs 21 events, relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.47-1.80). In the HCQ group, 2.8% of the patients died within 7 days vs 4.6% in the no-HCQ group (3 vs 4 events, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13-2.89), and 27.4% and 24.1%, respectively, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within 7 days (24 vs 23 events, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65-2.00).

139,"Protecting our health care workers while protecting our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparison of approaches and early outcomes in two Italian regions, Italy, 2020","Introduction Italy, which has been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, has an overriding national strategy, but its 21 regions have adapted their response based on the organization of their curative and public health services. In this paper, we compare outcomes for two northern Italian regions which had almost simultaneous initial outbreaks: Lombardy, which had a patient-centered approach that relied on primary care physicians and hospital care, and Veneto, which focused on community-based diagnosis and care. Methods We used numerator and denominator data from public Italian government sources to calculate reported rates of COVID-19 testing/1000, COVID-19 cases/100,000 overall and for health care workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs, deaths per 100,000, and the percent of cases admitted to hospitals and ICUs for February 24-April 1, 2020. Results As of April 1, 2020, Lombardy experienced 44,733 cases and 7,539 deaths; for Veneto, the corresponding values were 9,625 and 499. The cumulative case rate was 445/100,000 for Lombardy and 196/100,000 for Veneto, a 2.3-fold difference. Mortality rates were 7.5 times higher in Lombardy than in Veneto (75/100,000 and 10/100,000, respectively). Cumulative rates of testing were nearly twice as high in Veneto and were 2.7 times higher in the first week of the epidemic. In Lombardy, 51.5% of patients were admitted, including, 5.2% to intensive care units; for Veneto, the corresponding figures were 25.1% and 4.3%, respectively. HCWs account for 14.3% of all cases in Lombardy compared with 4.4% in Veneto. In Lombardy, the rate among HCWs was 19.1 times higher than in the general population (6,924 versus 362 per 100,000), while in Veneto it was 3.9 times higher (676 versus 172/100,000). Discussion The community-based approach in Veneto appears to be associated with substantially reduced rates of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and infection in HCWs compared with the patient-centered approach in Lombardy. Our findings suggest that the impact of COVID-19 can be reduced through strong and aggressive public health efforts to confirm and isolate cases and contacts in a timely way and to minimize unnecessary contact between HCWs and cases through home-based testing and pro-active home follow-up.","Binkin, N.; Salmaso, S.; Michieletto, F.; Russo, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060707v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060707v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
140,Potency and timing of antiviral therapy as determinants of duration of SARS CoV-2 shedding and intensity of inflammatory response,"Treatments are desperately needed to lower the hospitalization and case fatality rates of SARS CoV-2 infection. In order to meaningfully impact the COVID-19 pandemic, promising antiviral therapies must be identified within the next several months. However, the number of clinical trials that can be performed in this timeframe is limited. We therefore developed a mathematical model which allows projection of all possible therapeutic approaches. Our model recapitulates off-treatment viral dynamics and predicts a three-phase immune response. Addition of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus is possible. Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication. Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under the curve. We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load. Our results support an early test and treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.","Goyal, A.; Cardozo-Ojeda, E.

141,"Chaos, Percolation and the Coronavirus Spread: the Italian case","A model based on chaotic maps and turbulent flows is applied to the spread of Coronavirus for each Italian region in order to obtain useful information and help to contrast it. We divide the regions into different risk categories and discuss anomalies. The worst cases are confined between the Appenine and the Alps mountain ranges but the situation seem to improve closer to the sea. The Veneto region gave the most efficient response so far and some of their resources could be diverted to other regions, in particular more tests to the Lombardia, Liguria, Piemonte, Marche and V. Aosta regions, which seem to be worst affected. We noticed worrying anomalies in the Lazio, Campania and Sicilia regions to be monitored. We stress that the number of fatalities we predicted on March 12 has been confirmed daily by the bulletins. This suggests a change of strategy in order to reduce such number maybe moving the weaker population (and negative to the virus test) to beach resorts, which should be empty presently. The ratio deceased/positives on April 4, 2020 is 5.4% worldwide, 12.3% in Italy, 1.4% in Germany, 2.7% in the USA, 10.3% in the UK and 4.1% in China.

142,A Stratified Model to Quantify the Effects of Containment Policies on the Spread of COVID-19,"The SARS-Cov-2 virus is spreading fast all over the world and has already imposed a significant social and economic cost in many countries. Different countries have utilised a variety of containment policies with an emphasis on social distancing as a strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantifying the effects of such policies in different time-scales and comparing the efficacy of various available policies is of utmost importance for policy-makers in different countries. That is even more important when the policy-makers want to plan for long-term strategies and to weigh each option based on its epidemiological effects and socio-economic costs. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the interactions between individuals in a population and the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, quantifying the effects of these policies is very difficult. Hence, there is an immediate need for models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in a population, without the need for such detailed information. In this manuscript, a method is presented that can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any country and under any containment policy imposed separately on different groups in the population. The method tunes the parameters of a known stratified model based on the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The model includes a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is easy to simulate and easy to understand. As it is presented in this manuscript, the population is divided into age-groups. But given the availability of the data, there is no reason to limit the stratification into only age-groups and we can consider any relevant groups. To estimate the parameters of the model such that it reflects the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in a population, the method relies on an optimisation scheme. More specifically, the optimisation scheme estimates the contact rates between different age groups in the population. But a very important and useful feature of the model is that the estimated parameters for one population can be translated and used for any other population with a known age-structure, which in this day and age, includes almost any country or city in the world. Also, it is shown that the method is quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme and also to deliberate or non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in collecting the data. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated using a case study under different containment policies, from an uncontained population to mitigation and suppression policies. Also, we can use the model to quantify the effects of strategies which include switching between different containment policies at pre-determined points in time. The model allows us to quantify the effects of each of these policies on the spread of the disease in a population, in particular, the instantaneous and total numbers of infectious individuals in a population which are important parameters for policy-makers. The simulation results, as explained in the following, provide some insight into various policies and some of the results are possibly counter-intuitive for many people. For example, the model predicts that closing down schools and universities without any other containment policy imposed on older age-groups has almost no impact on the number of patients that might need support-care in hospitals. The method provides an easy-to-use tool to use the information collected on the spread of COVID-19 in a country or region and then use that information in another population which might not have been as widely affected by the disease yet.","Bokharaie, V.

143,COVID-19 lockdowns cause global air pollution declines with implications for public health risk,"The lockdown response to COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented reduction in global economic activity. We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find remarkable declines in ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: -29 % with 95% confidence interval -44% to -13%), ozone (O3: -11%; -20% to -2%) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: -9%; -28% to 10%) during the first two weeks of lockdown (n = 27 countries). These results are largely mirrored by satellite measures of the troposphere although long-distance transport of PM2.5 resulted in more heterogeneous changes relative to NO2. Pollutant anomalies were related to short-term health outcomes using empirical exposure-response functions. We estimate that there was a net total of 7400 (340 to 14600) premature deaths and 6600 (4900 to 7900) pediatric asthma cases avoided during two weeks post-lockdown. In China and India alone, the PM2.5-related avoided premature mortality was 1400 (1100 to 1700) and 5300 (1000 to 11700), respectively. Assuming that the lockdown-induced deviations in pollutant concentrations are maintained for the duration of 2020, we estimate 0.78 (0.09 to 1.5) million premature deaths and 1.6 (0.8 to 2) million pediatric asthma cases could be avoided globally. While the state of global lockdown is not sustainable, these findings illustrate the potential health benefits gained from reducing 'business as usual' air pollutant emissions from economic activities.","Venter, Z.

We derive methods for calculating upper and lower bounds of the expected number of infected individuals, as well as provide estimates on the number of vaccinations that is needed for containment. We calculate these explicitly on trees, d-dimensional grids, and Erd[o]s Renyi graphs. Finally, we construct a time-dependent budget allocation strategy and demonstrate its superiority over constant budget allocation on real networks following first acquaintance vaccination.

145,Acceptance and preference for COVID-19 vaccination in health-care workers (HCWs),"The objective of the present study is to reveal the acceptance and preference for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination in health-care workers (HCWs). We performed an internet-based, region-stratified survey among 352 HCWs and 189 individuals in the general population enrolled on March 17th and 18th 2020 from 26 Chinese provinces. The HCWs developed a more in-depth understanding of SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection and showed a higher tolerance to the future vaccination than the general population. 76.4% of HCWs (vs. 72.5% in the general) showed their willingness to receive vaccination. Potential benefits from COVID-19 outbreak such as seeking influenza (65.3%) or pneumonia (55.7%) vaccination can be gained in HCWs. To estimate the relative effects of attributes influencing vaccination choice in the discrete choice experiment, 7 attributes (3 disease-relevant, 3 vaccine-relevant, and 1 of social acceptance) were identified as key determinants.

146,An effect assessment of Airborne particulate matter pollution on COVID-19: A multi-city Study in China,"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious infectious disease, which has caused great number of deaths and health problems worldwide. This study aims to examine the effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution on COVID-19 across China. Methods: In this study, we obtained confirmed cases of COVID-19, the data of airborne ambient PM with aerodynamic diameter [&le;] 2.5 m (PM2.5) and [&le;] 10 m (PM10), ambient temperature (AT), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) in 72 cities of China (excluded Wuhan city) on a daily basis, each of which confirmed more than 50 cases from January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. We applied a two-stage analysis. Generalized additive models with quasi-Poisson distribution was first fitted to estimate city-specific effects of PM10 and PM2.5 on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases while controlling AT, AH and MSI. Then, we used meta-analysis to generate the pooled effect estimates from city-specific results. Results: During the study period, there were a total of 24 939 COVID-19 cases, most of which were reported in Hubei Province. In our meta-analysis, we found each 10 g/m3 increase in concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 7 and lag 14) were positively associated with confirmed cases of COVID-19, not including PM10 at lag 5, lag 6 and lag 7, and PM2.5 at lag 5, lag 6. Similar trend was also found in different cumulative lag days (from lag 01 to lag 07 and lag 014). The effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases are statistically significant for three cumulative lag periods over 3, 7 and 14 days with the greatest effect over 14 days. The estimated RRs of which were 1.64 (95% CIs: 1.47, 1.82) and 1.47 (95% CIs: 1.34, 1.61) with each 10 g/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. In addition, we found that the effects of PM2.5 on daily confirmed cases were greater than PM10 in all included lag days. Conclusions: This nationwide study suggests that airborne PM pollution likely increases the risk of getting COVID-19 in China.","Wang, B.; Liu, J.; Fu, S.; Xu, X.; Li, L.; Ma, Y.; Zhou, J.; Yao, J.; Liu, X.; Zhang, X.; He, X.; Yan, J.; Shi, Y.; Ren, X.; Niu, J.; Luo, B.; zhang, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20060137v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20060137v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
147,Next weeks of SARS-CoV-2: Projection model to predict time evolution scenarios of accumulated cases in Spain,"Background and objectives: SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of coronavirus that can affect people and causes respiratory disease, COVID-19. It is affecting the entire planet and we focus in Spain, where the first case was detected at the end of January 2020 and in recent weeks it has increased in many cases. We need predictive models in order to be efficient and take actions. The general goal of this work is present a new model of SARS-CoV-2 to predict different scenarios of accumulated cases in Spain. Material and methods: In this short report is used a model proposed previously, based on a parametric model Weibull and in a the library BDSbiost3 developed in R to infer and predict different scenarios of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 for the accumulated cases in Spain after the spread that affects Spain detected at the end of January of this year. Results: In the analyses presented, projective curves have been generated for the evolution of accumulated cases in which they reach about 4,000 cases or about 15,000 cases, for which the lines of the day in which the value for 90 will be reached can be seen vertically 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases, from that day they will begin to descend or remain the same), that is why the vertical lines would indicate the brake of the disease. For the worst-case scenario, it takes 118, 126 or 142 days to reach the maximum number of cases (n = 15,000) to reach 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases), respectively. This means translated in a time scale that in the worst case the virus will not stop its progress, in Spain, until summer 2020, hopefully before. Comments and conclusions: This model could be used to plan the resources and see if the policies or means dedicated to the virus are slowing the progress of the virus or it is necessary to implement others that are more effective, and can also validate a method for future outbreaks of diseases such as these.","MONLEON-GETINO, T.; Canela-Soler, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059881v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059881v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
148,COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures impact on mental health among the general population in Italy. An N=18147 web-based survey.,"Background The psychological impact of the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and lockdown measures on the Italian population are unknown. The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to four weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. Methods A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 6th 2020. 18147 individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors. Results Respondents endorsing PTSS, depression, anxiety, insomnia, high perceived stress and adjustment disorder were 6604 (37%), 3084 (17.3%), 3700 (20.8%), 1301 (7.3%), 3895 (21.8%) and 4092 (22.9%), respectively. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS. Having a loved one deceased by COVID-19 was associated with PTSS, depression, perceived stress and insomnia. Conclusion We found high rates of negative mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three weeks into the COVID-19 lockdown measures and different COVID-19 related risk factors. These findings warrant further monitoring on the Italian population s mental health.","Rossi, R.; Socci, V.; Talevi, D.; Mensi, S.; Niolu, C.; Pacitti, F.; Di Marco, A.; Rossi, A.; Siracusano, A.; Di Lorenzo, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20057802v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20057802v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
149,Implementation of a Novel Remote Physician SBRT Coverage Process during the Coronavirus Pandemic,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments. Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice. METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO's shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.","Price, A.

150,Recovery Ratios Reliably Anticipate COVID-19 Pandemic Progression,"The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare systems worldwide and exacting a massive humanitarian toll. This makes the development of accurate predictive models imperative, not just for understanding the course of the pandemic but more importantly for gaining insight into the efficacy of public health measures and planning accordingly. Epidemiological models are forced to make assumptions about many unknowns and therefore can be unreliable. Here, taking an empirical approach, we report a 20-30 day lag between the peak of confirmed to recovered cases and the peak of daily deaths in each country, independent of the epoch of that country in its pandemic cycle. This analysis is expected to be largely independent of the proportion of the population being tested and therefore should aid in planning around the timing and easing of public health measures. Our data also suggests broad predictions for the number of fatalities, generally somewhat lower than most other models. Finally, our model suggests that the world as a whole is shortly to enter a recovery phase, at least as far as the first pandemic wave is concerned.","Nicolau, D.

151,"The Epidemiological Implications of Incarceration Dynamics in Jails for Community, Corrections Officer, and Incarcerated Population Risks from COVID-19","COVID-19 challenges the daily function of nearly every institution of society. It is the duty of any society to be responsive to such challenges by relying on the best tools and logic available to analyze the costs and benefits of any mitigative action. We here provide a mathematical model to explore the epidemiological consequences of allowing standard intake and unaltered within-jail operational dynamics to be maintained during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and contrast this with proposed interventions to reduce the burden of negative health outcomes. In this way, we provide estimates of the infection risks, and likely loss of life, that arise from current incarceration practices. We provide estimates for in-custody deaths and show how the within-jail dynamics lead to spill-over risks, not only affecting the incarcerated people, but increasing the exposure, infection, and death rates for both corrections officers with whom they interact within the jail system, and the broader community beyond the justice system. We show that, given a typical jail-community dynamic, operating in a business as usual way will result in significant and rapid loss of life. Large scale reductions in arrest and speeding of releases are likely to save the lives of incarcerated people, staff and the community at large.","Lofgren, E.; Lum, K.; Horowitz, A.; Madubuowu, B.; Fefferman, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058842v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058842v1?rss=1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,,True
152,"Rapid, large-scale, and effective detection of COVID-19 via non-adaptive testing","Pooling of samples can increase lab capacity when using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infections such as COVID-19. However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall infection incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale very favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.","Täufer, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.028431v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.028431v1?rss=1,2020-04-13,2020-04-13,,False

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression, putative functions, and transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung specimens. Single cell RNA-Seq data indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in the key protective cell types including the goblet and ciliary epithelial cells, as well as in the endothelial cells and type I pneumocytes. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. A novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites identified several putative sites for determined transcription factors within the ACE2 gene promoter. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung.","Barker, H.; Parkkila, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.038752v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.038752v1?rss=1,2020-04-13,2020-04-13,,False
154,Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management (MAPCM),"The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 prompted stringent mitigation measures to ""flatten the curve"" quickly leading to an asphyxiated US economy as a national side effect. The resulting flattened curve remain exponential and may still exceed available healthcare resources and capacity during and around its peak. Moreover, while isolation and containment can scale down daily cases significantly, such a mitigation strategy also prolong the outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely having disasterous repercussions. Mitigation for the duration of the outbreak may therefore be unsustainable and risk a second wave of infections. The method for active pandemic curve management (MAPCM) presented herein has the potential to shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which equates to the ramping up of economic activity, and it leaves breathing room for the economy from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as projected hospitalizations per day) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak. To be successful the method must be implemented early enough in the outbreak. Implementing the method incorrectly can result in a herd immunity levels of infections. MAPCM is a method and not a model. It is compatible with any appropriate model. In the paper a hybrid logistic model is used for illustration.","Odendaal, W.

155,The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain elicits a potent neutralizing response without antibody-dependent enhancement,"The SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. Antibodies to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002-2003, have been shown to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1 S-protein-mediated entry, and the presence of anti-RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. Here we show that immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response in rodents, comparable to 100 {micro}g/ml of ACE2-Ig, a potent SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. Importantly, anti-sera from immunized animals did not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of S-protein-mediated entry under conditions in which Zika virus ADE was readily observed. These data suggest that an RBD-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 could be safe and effective.","Quinlan, B. D.; Mou, H.; Zhang, L.; Gao, Y.; He, W.; Ojha, A.; Parcells, M.

Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and new world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis.

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for vaccine, antibodies and inhibitor development because of many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In this study, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immune-informatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in solution aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel analytical tool axial frequency distribution (AFD). Comprehensive binding free energies estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor from van der Waals.

162,Insights on early mutational events in SARS-CoV-2 virus reveal founder effects across geographical regions,"Here we aim to describe early mutational events across samples from publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the sequence read archive repository. Up until March 27, 2020, we downloaded 53 illumina datasets, mostly from China, USA (Washington DC) and Australia (Victoria). Of 30 high quality datasets, 27 datasets (90%) contain at least a single founder mutation and most of the variants are missense (over 63%). Five-point mutations with clonal (founder) effect were found in USA sequencing samples. Sequencing samples from USA in GenBank present this signature with 50% allele frequencies among samples. Australian mutation signatures were more diverse than USA samples, but still, clonal events were found in those samples. Mutations in the helicase and orf1a coding regions from SARS-CoV-2 were predominant, among others, suggesting that these proteins are prone to evolve by natural selection. Finally, we firmly urge that primer sets for diagnosis be carefully designed, since rapidly occurring variants would affect the performance of the reverse transcribed quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based viral testing.","Farkas, C.; Fuentes-Villalobos, F.; Garrido, J.

163,A Computational Approach to Design Potential siRNA Molecules as a Prospective Tool for Silencing Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein and Surface Glycoprotein Gene of SARS-CoV-2,"A disease outbreak named COVID-19, caused by a RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has become pandemic with a magnitude which is daunting to all public health institutions in the absence of specific antiviral treatment. Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, through a rigorous filtering process 8 siRNA molecules were selected with exerts the best action.

165,Scutellaria baicalensis extract and baicalein inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its 3C-like protease in vitro,"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that threatens millions of people worldwide. There is an urgent call for developing effective drugs against the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing this disease. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), is highly conserved across coronaviruses and is essential for the maturation process of viral polyprotein. Scutellariae radix (Huangqin in Chinese), the root of Scutellaria baicalensis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat viral infection related symptoms. The extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum antiviral activities. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredient compounds. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity in vitro and the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with an EC50 of 0.74 g/ml. Among the major components of S. baicalensis, baicalein strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity with an IC50 of 0.39 M. We further identified four baicalein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity at microM concentration. Our study demonstrates that the extract of S. baicalensis has effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and baicalein and analogue compounds are strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors.","Liu, H.; Ye, F.; Sun, Q.; Liang, H.; Li, C.; Lu, R.; Huang, B.; Tan, W.; Lai, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035824v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035824v1?rss=1,2020-04-12,2020-04-12,,False

168,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection During Pregnancy In China: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of the ongoing worldwide epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China and worldwide. However, there were few studies about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 31 pregnant women and 35 non-pregnant women from Jan 28 to Feb 28, 2020 to evaluate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Inflammatory indices were used to assess the severity of COVID-19. Evidence of vertical transmission was determined by laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples. Findings Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women had a significantly lower proportion of fever (54.8% vs. 87.5%, p= 0.006), a shorter average interval from onset to hospitalization, and a higher proportion of severe or critical COVID-19 (32.3% vs. 11.4%, p=0.039). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systematic immune-inflammation-based prognostic index (SII) were significantly higher on admission in severe/critical pneumonia group than moderate pneumonia group. We could not detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples. Conclusions The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women were insidious and atypical, compared with those in non-pregnant patients. SII and NLR could be a useful marker to evaluate the severity of COVID-19. There was no evidence of vertical transmission during pregnancy with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yin, M.; Zhang, L.; Deng, G.; Han, C.; Shen, M.; Sun, H.; Zeng, F.; Zhang, W.; Chen, L.; Luo, Q.; Yao, D.; Wu, M.; Yu, S.; Chen, H.; Baud, D.; Chen, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20053744v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20053744v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
169,Non-specific Primers Reveal False-negative Risk in Detection of COVID-19 Infections,"Background: A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan of Hubei province and had spread throughout the world since December 2019. Because the clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province were reported for the first time on February 13, 2020, a very high peak of new cases in China was observed. The reason why so many clinically diagnosed cases appeared was not clear. Methods: All data of new cases in China were acquired from WHO situation reports. Linear fitting was used to infer the ability to detect COVID-19 infections. Primer-BLAST and nucleotide blast were applied to check the specificity of primers. Expression data of human mRNA in different tissues was obtained from Human Protein Atlas. Finding: Based on the data and analysis of changes of new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases, it was inferred that there were many false-negative results in all clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province. There were eight non-specific primers in dozens of primers used in clinical or research detection of COVID-19. Among them, a pair of primer for the ORF1ab regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which widely applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in China, well matched some human mRNAs such as Cathepsin C transcripts. Compared to other transcripts, Cathepsin C mRNA had a high abundance in tonsil, lung and small intestine. Interpretation: Some non-specific RT-PCR primers could cause the serious interference during RT-PCR amplification so as to increase the risk of false-negative diagnoses for COVID-19 infections.

170,New Epidemiological Model Suggestions Revealing Size of Epidemics Based on the COVID-19 Pandemic Example: Wavelength Models,"The main purpose of the study is to introduce the wavelength models developed to measure the size of outbreaks based on the COVID-19 example. In this way, the wavelengths of the outbreaks can be calculated, ensuring that the outbreaks are valid, reliable and easy to follow at the national and international level. Wavelength models consist of approved case, death, recovered case and net wavelength models. Thus, the size of the outbreak can be measured both individually and as a whole. COVID-19 cases of 181 countries were used to demonstrate the application of the models. The prominent findings in the applied wavelength models are as follows: the countries with the highest case wavelength are USA, Italy, Spain and Germany, respectively. However, Italy ranks first in the death wavelength, followed by Spain, the USA and France. On the other hand, China has taken the first place in the recovered case wavelength. This country was followed by Spain and Germany and Italy, respectively. Based on all these wavelength models mentioned, net wavelength lengths are calculated.

Methods: We proposed to use a retrospective case-control study to give a comparison between suspected patients and confirmed patients in the clinical characteristics. Results: (56%) patients were confirmed for COVID-19 from suspected 167 patients. We find that elder people were more likely to be infected by COVID-19. Among the confirmed 94 patients, 2 (2%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 0 (0%) patients died during the study period. We find that images of CT scan of patients with a COVID-19 are significantly different from patients without a COVID-19. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use the case-control design to study the coronavirus disease, since it is particularly appropriate for investigating infectious disease outbreaks. The clinical treatment experience in this study can supply a guideline for treating COVID-19 as the number of the infected patients is increasing in the world. Compared with other studies, we find that the mortality rate and the intensive care unit rate can be reduced if patients can be treated timely in the right identification and detection with nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan.

172,Noisy Pooled PCR for Virus Testing,"Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite their accuracy for single sample analysis, infectious diseases diagnostic tools, like RT-PCR, require substantial resources to test large populations. We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized.

173,Two mechanisms for accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 outbreaks in regions with high intensity of population and polluting industrialization: the air pollution-to-human and human-to-human transmission dynamics,"What is COVID-19? Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is viral infection that generates a severe acute respiratory syndrome with serious pneumonia that may result in progressive respiratory failure and death. What are the goals of this investigation? This study explains the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy that is generating a high level of deaths and suggests general lessons learned for a strategy to cope with future epidemics similar to COVID-19 to reduce viral infectivity and negative impacts in economic systems and society. What are the results of this study? The main results are: o The accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution. o Hinterland cities have average days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) equal to 80 days, and an average number of infected more than 2,000 individuals as of April 1st, 2020, coastal cities have days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 equal to 60 days and have about 700 infected in average. o Cities that average number of 125 days exceeding the limits set for PM10, last year, they have an average number of infected individual higher than 3,200 units, whereas cities having less than 100 days (average number of 48 days) exceeding the limits set for PM10, they have an average number of about 900 infected individuals. o The results reveal that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in specific environments is due to two mechanisms given by: air pollution-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission; in particular, the mechanisms of air pollution-to-human transmission play a critical role rather than human-to-human transmission. o The finding here suggests that to minimize future epidemic similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year in which cities can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological condition, is less than 50 days. After this critical threshold, the analytical output here suggests that environmental inconsistencies because of the combination between air pollution and meteorological conditions (with high moisture%, low wind speed and fog) trigger a take-off of viral infectivity (accelerated epidemic diffusion) with damages for health of population, economy and society. What is a socioeconomic strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19? Considering the complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity, lessons learned for COVID-19 have to be applied for a proactive socioeconomic strategy to cope with future epidemics, especially an environmental policy based on reduction of air pollution mainly in hinterland zones of countries, having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and fog that create an environment that can damage immune system of people and foster a fast transmission of viral infectivity similar to the COVID-19. This study must conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID 19 has also to be designed in environmental and sustainability science and not only in terms of biology.","Coccia, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055657v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055657v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
174,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care Workers in a large public hospital in Madrid, Spain, during March 2020","Background On January 31st the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Spain, an imported case from Germany in Canary Islands, and thereafter on February 25th the first case was detected in Madrid. The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre on March 1st, a large public hospital with 1200 beds, covering an area over 400000 inhabitants in southern Madrid. During March 2020 highly active circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was experienced in Madrid with 24090 cases officially reported by March 29th. Methods Since the beginning of the epidemics the Occupational Health and Safety Service (OHSS) organized the consulting and testing of the hospital personnel with confirmed exposure and also those presenting symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection. For molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from suspected cases and processed at the Microbiology Laboratory by automatized specific PCR methods that was operative from February 25th as part of the preparedness. Results From a total of 6800 employees of the hospital, 2085 (30,6 %) were tested during the period 1-29 March 2020, some of them repeatedly (2286 total samples). The first HCW infected was confirmed on March 9th. A total of 791 HCW and personnel were confirmed to be infected by March 29th, representing 38% of those tested and 11,6 % of all the hospital workers. The proportion of infected individuals was estimated among the different groups of occupational exposure and the evolution of the cases during the expansive epidemic wave was compared between HCW and those patients attending at the Emergency Department (ER) during the same period and adjusted by the same age range. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR detection between HCW from high risk areas involved in close contact with COVID-19 patients in comparison with clerical, administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients. The curves of evolution of accumulated cases between patients and HCW during March 2020 showed an almost parallel shape. Discussion The recommendation from our OHSS did not include testing of asymptomatic cases but was highly proactive in testing even patients with minor symptoms therefore, a high proportion of HCW and non-sanitary personnel was tested in March 2020 during the rapid period of expansion of the epidemics in Madrid, accounting for a total of 30,6 % of the hospital employees. Most of the COVID-19 cases among the hospital HCW and personnel were mild and managed at home under self-isolation measures, however 23 (3%) required hospitalization mostly due to severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia, two of those cases required mechanical ventilation at the ICU. No fatalities occurred during the study period. Although there were some cases of highly probable transmission from COVID-19 patients to HCWs, mainly at the first phase of the epidemics, there were no significant differences on the infection rates of HCW and hospital personnel that can be related to working in areas of high exposure risk. Furthermore, the evolution of cases during the same time period (March 2020) between patients attending the ER and hospital staff suggests that both groups were driven by the same dynamics. This experience is similar to the communicated from Wuhan verified by the WHO Joint Mission and also from recent experiences at hospital in the Netherlands, where most of the infections of HCW were related to household or community contacts. Significance Since the collective of hospital HCW are exhaustively screened in specific centers, their rate of infection for SARS-CoV-2 could be an indicator of the epidemic dynamics in the community. There appears to be a close connection between HCW infection and the driving forces of transmission in the community. Although we cannot exclude an additional risk factor of infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the fact of the hospital environment, the similar proportions of positive cases among all the areas of the hospital and the evolutive wave of infection, as compared with the community, are clear arguments against a major factor of occupational risk. Exhaustive testing, such as the one carried out in our institution, covering over one third of all the workers, could be used as a reference of the population infected in the community. Since a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested, it is highly likely that this 11,6 % is a minimum estimation of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Madrid during the first 4 weeks of the epidemics. This is in high and clear contrast with the official figures circulating at national and international levels. This has important implications to more precisely estimate the actual number of cases in the community and to develop public health policies for containment, treatment and recovery.","Folgueira, M.

Risk factors for mortality have not been well summarized. Current meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between age, gender, comorbidities and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. Methods: Online databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Google scholar were searched to detect relevant publications up to 22 March 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, random-effects model was used. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also done. Results: In total, six retrospective studies with 22,350 COVID-19 infected patients and 741 cases of death were included in the current meta-analysis. A significant positive association was found between older age ([&ge;]65 years old) and COVID-19 mortality (combined effect size=2.39 (over twofold), 95% CIs=1.75-3.28, p<0.001). Such finding was also seen for hypertension (combined effect size=3.29 (over threefold), 95% CIs=1.54-7.05, p=0.002), diabetes (combined effect size=3.11 (over threefold), 95% CIs=1.10-8.80, p=0.032), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (combined effect size=7.69 (over sevenfold), 95% CIs=5.65-10.47, p<0.001) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (combined effect size=7.39 (over sevenfold), 95% CIs=2.88-18.96, p<0.001). Conclusions: Older age, hypertension, diabetes, COPD and CVDs were associated with greater risk of death from COVID-19 infection.

176,"Know Your Epidemic, Know Your Response: Covid-19 in the United States","We document that during the week of March 10-16, the Covid-19 pandemic fundamentally affected the perceptions of U.S. residents about the health risks and socioeconomic consequences entailed by the pandemic. During this week, it seems, ""everything changed."" Not only did the pandemic progress rapidly across the United States, but U.S. residents started to realize that the threat was real: increasing Covid-19 caseloads heightened perceptions of infection risks and excess mortality risks, concerns about the economic implications increased substantially, and behavioral responses became widespread as the pandemic expanded rapidly in the U.S. In early to mid-March 2020, average perceptions about the coronavirus infection risks are broadly consistent with projections about the pandemic, while expectations about dying conditional on infection and expectations about Covid-19-related excess mortality during the next months are possibly too pessimistic. However, some aspects of Covid-19 perceptions are disconcerting from the perspective of implementing and sustaining an effective societal response to the pandemic. For instance, the education gradient in expected infection risks entails the possibility of having different perceptions of the reality of the pandemic between people with and without a college education, potentially resulting in two different levels of behavioral and policy-responses across individuals and regions. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, some of the misperceptions about Covid-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the United States to implement and sustain the widespread and harsh policies that are required to curtail the pandemic. Our analyses also reveal perceptions of becoming infected with the virus, and dying from Covid-19, were driven upwards by a rapidly increasing national caseload, and perceptions of the economic consequences and the adaptation of social distancing were affected by both national and state-level cases.","Ciancio, A.; Kämpfen, F.; Kohler, I.

177,A secure and rapid query-software for COVID-19 test results that can easily be integrated into the clinical workflow to avoid communication overload,"Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis requires new ideas and strategies. Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential to monitor, and delay, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. People not knowing that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, are a risk for infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that take the throat swab and have to communicate test results. Here, we present a secure tracking system (CTest) to report COVID-19 test results online as soon as they become available. The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person but also the test units, e.g. hospitals or the public healthcare system. Instead of personal calls, CTest updates the status of the test automatically when the test results are available. Test reports are published on a secured web-page enabling regular status checks also by patients not using smartphones with dedicated mobile apps which has some importance as smartphone usage diminishes with age. The source code, as well as further information to integrate CTest into the IT environment of other clinics or test-centres, are freely available from https://github.com/sysbio-bioinf/CTest under the Eclipse Public License v2.0 (EPL2).","Voelkel, G.; Fuerstberger, A.; Schwab, J.

179,COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia: Impact of lock-down on infection dynamics,"COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia started as a small wave of 22 cases in January 2020 through imported cases. It was followed by a bigger wave mainly from local transmissions resulting in 651 cases. The following wave saw unexpectedly three digit number of daily cases following a mass gathering urged the government to choose a more stringent measure. A limited lock-down approach called Movement Control Order (MCO) was immediately initiated to the whole country as a way to suppress the epidemic trajectory. The lock-down causes a major socio-economic disruption thus the ability to forecast the infection dynamic is urgently required to assist the government on timely decisions. Limited testing capacity and limited epidemiological data complicate the understanding of the future infection dynamic of the COVID-19 epidemic. Three different epidemic forecasting models was used to generate forecasts of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia using daily reported cumulative case data up until 1st April 2020 from the Malaysia Ministry of Health. The forecasts were generated using a Curve Fitting Model with Probability Density Function and Skewness Effect, the SIR Model, and a System Dynamic Model. Method one based on curve fitting with probability density function estimated that the peak will be on 19th April 2020 with an estimation of 5,637 infected persons. Method two based on SIR Model estimated that the peak will be on 20th - 31st May 2020 if Movement Contro (MCO) is in place with an estimation of 630,000 to 800,000 infected persons. Method three based on System Dynamic Model estimated that the peak will be on 17th May 2020 with an estimation of 22,421 infected persons. Forecasts from each of model suggested the epidemic may peak between middle of April to end of May 2020.

The median of the estimated number of undiagnosed symptomatic patients per diagnosed patient decreased from 1.9 to 0.77 after the declaration, and the median of the estimated number of total infected individuals per diagnosed patient decreased from 4.7 to 2.4.

Studying the convergence behavior of the two parameter sets obtained this way, we attempt to estimate the reliability of predictions made concerning the future course of the epidemic.

Incidence continues to rise. As the epidemic threatens to overwhelm health care systems, identifying regions where the expected disease burden is likely to be high relative to the rest of the country is critical for enabling prudent and effective distribution of emergency resources. Across all global regions affected by the pandemic, an elevated risk of severe outcomes has consistently been observed in older age groups. Using age-specific mortality patterns in tandem with demographic data, we map a projection of the cumulative burden of COVID-19 and the associated cumulative burden on the healthcare system at the county-scale in the United States for a scenario in which 20% of the population of each county acquires infection. We identify regions that may be particularly impacted relative to the rest of the country, and observe a general trend that per capita disease burden and relative healthcare system demand may be highest away from major population centers.","Miller, I.

183,Making sense of the Global Coronavirus Data: The role of testing rates in understanding the pandemic and our exit strategy,"The Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) outbreak has caused havoc across the world. Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has focused on number of cases and deaths and predicted projections have focused on these parameters. We propose that the number of tests performed is a very important denominator in understanding the COVID-19 data. We analysed the number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths across different countries and projected pandemic outcomes. We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the highest number of COVID 19 cases. We analysed this data according to the number of tests performed as the main denominator. Country wise population level pandemic projections were extrapolated utilising three models - 1) inherent case per test and death per test rates at the time of obtaining the data (4/4/2020 0900 BST) for each country; 2) rates adjusted according to the countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates adjusted according to South Korea. We showed that testing rates impact on the number of cases and deaths and ultimately on future projections for the pandemic across different countries. We found that countries with the highest testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world are the tip of the iceberg or not. Accordingly, obtaining this information through a rapid increase in testing globally is the only way which will enable us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce economic and social instability.","Potluri, R.; Lavu, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054239v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054239v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True

A recent publication, linked nation based universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination to potential protection against morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2, and received much attention in public media, even before its peer review. We wished to validate the findings by examining the association between daily rates of COVID-19 case fatality (i.e. Death Per Case /Days of the endemic [dpc/d]) and the presence of universal BCG vaccination before 1980, or the year of the establishment of universal vaccination. There was no significant association in either analysis. In this work we emphasize caution amidst the publication surge on COVID-19, and highlight the political/economical-, arbitrary selection-, and fear/anxiety related biases, which may obscure scientific rigor. It is underscored that physical (social) distancing (i.e. quarantine) and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the only epidemiologic measures (Iceland being a great example, where universal BCG vaccination policy was never in place), which consistently associate with successful counteraction of morbidity and mortality during the pandemic.","Szigeti, R.; Kellermayer, D.; Kellermayer, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20056903v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20056903v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True

188,Potential dissemination of epidemics based on Brazilian mobile geolocation data. Part I: Population dynamics and future spreading of infection in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the pandemic of COVID-19.,"Mobile geolocation data is a valuable asset in the assessment of movement patterns of a population. Once a highly contagious disease takes place in a location the movement patterns aid in predicting the potential spatial spreading of the disease, hence mobile data becomes a crucial tool to epidemic models. In this work, based on millions of anonymized mobile visits data in Brazil, we investigate the most probable spreading patterns of the COVID-19 within states of Brazil. The study is intended to help public administrators in action plans and resources allocation, whilst studying how mobile geolocation data may be employed as a measure of population mobility during an epidemic. The first part of the study focus on the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the period of March 2020, when the disease first started to spread in these states. Metapopulation models for the disease spread were simulated in order to evaluate the risk of infection of each city within the states, by ranking them according to the time the disease will take to infect each city. We observed that, although the high risk regions are those closer to the capital cities, where the outbreak has started, there are also cities in the countryside with great risk.","Peixoto, P.

189,Experience with Social Distancing Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Implications for Public Health Messaging,"Our goal is to inform ongoing public health policy on the design and communication of COVID-19 social distancing measures to maximize compliance. We assessed the US publics early experience with the COVID-19 crisis during the period when shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented to understand non-compliance with those orders, sentiment about the crisis, and to compare across age categories associated with different levels of risk. We posted our survey on Twitter, Facebook, and NextDoor on March 14th to March 23rd that included 21 questions including demographics, impact on daily life, actions taken, and difficulties faced. We analyzed the free-text responses to the impact question using LIWC, a computational natural language processing tool, and performed a thematic content analysis of the reasons people gave for non-compliance with social distancing orders. Stanford Universitys IRB approved the study. In 9 days, we collected a total of 20,734 responses. 6,573 individuals provided a response ([&ge;]30 words) to the question, Tell us how the coronavirus crisis is impacting your life. Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative, self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented (32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all p values < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Unsurprisingly, the oldest and most at-risk group (65+) are more focused on biological terms (e.g., health-related topics), but were surprisingly low in anxiety and high in emotionally positive terms relative to those at lower risk. We also content-analyzed 7,355 responses (kappas > .75) to the question, What are the reasons you are not self-isolating more? Of these participants, 39.8% reported not being compliant, with the youngest group (18-31) having the lowest compliance rate (52.4%) compared to the other age groups (all > 60%; all p values < .01). Table 1 describes the seven primary themes for non-compliance. Non-essential work requirements, concerns about mental and physical health, and the belief that other precautions were sufficient were the most common reasons, although other rationales included wanting to continue everyday activities and beliefs that society is over-reacting. Childcare was an important concern for a subset of respondents. Overall, our findings suggest that public health messages should focus on young people and 1) address their negative affect, 2) refocus their self-orientation by emphasizing the importance of individual behavior to group-level health outcomes, and 3) target the specific rationales that different people have regarding the pandemic to maximize compliance with social distancing.","Moore, R.

190,Comparative ACE2 variation and primate COVID-19 risk,"The emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans is highly infectious and leads to the potentially fatal disease COVID-19, has caused tens of thousands of deaths and huge global disruption. The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which have already been reduced to small and endangered populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies have shown that rhesus macaques exposed to the virus develop COVID-19-like symptoms, the susceptibility of other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys, exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus, hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, representing a critical threat to their survival. Urgent actions may be necessary to limit their exposure to humans.","Melin, A. D.; Janiak, M. C.; Marrone, F.; Arora, P. S.; Higham, J.

191,U.S. county-level characteristics to inform equitable COVID-19 response,"The spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the United States confirms that not all Americans are equally at risk of infection, severe disease, or mortality. A range of intersecting biological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors are likely to determine an individual's susceptibility to COVID-19. These factors vary significantly across counties in the United States, and often reflect the structural inequities in our society. Recognizing this vast inter-county variation in risks will be critical to mounting an adequate response strategy. Using publicly available county-specific data we identified key biological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors influencing susceptibility to COVID-19, guided by international experiences and consideration of epidemiological parameters of importance. We created bivariate county-level maps to summarize examples of key relationships across these categories, grouping age and poverty; comorbidities and lack of health insurance; proximity, density and bed capacity; and race and ethnicity, and premature death. We have also made available an interactive online tool that allows public health officials to query risk factors most relevant to their local context. Our data demonstrate significant inter-county variation in key epidemiological risk factors, with a clustering of counties in certain states, which will result in an increased demand on their public health system. While the East and West coast cities are particularly vulnerable owing to their densities (and travel routes), a large number of counties in the Southeastern states have a high proportion of at-risk populations, with high levels of poverty, comorbidities, and premature death at baseline, and low levels of health insurance coverage. The list of variables we have examined is by no means comprehensive, and several of them are interrelated and magnify underlying vulnerabilities. The online tool allows readers to explore additional combinations of risk factors, set categorical thresholds for each covariate, and filter counties above different population thresholds. COVID-19 responses and decision making in the United States remain decentralized. Both the federal and state governments will benefit from recognizing high intra-state, inter-county variation in population risks and response capacity. Many of the factors that are likely to exacerbate the burden of COVID-19 and the demand on healthcare systems are the compounded result of long-standing structural inequalities in US society. Strategies to protect those in the most vulnerable counties will require urgent measures to better support communities' attempts at social distancing and to accelerate cooperation across jurisdictions to supply personnel and equipment to counties that will experience high demand.","Chin, T.; Kahn, R.; Li, R.; Chen, J.

One area of active inquiry is understanding the mode(s) of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While respiratory droplets are a known mechanism of transmission, other mechanisms are possible. Of particular importance to global health is the possibility of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants through breastfeeding or consumption of human milk. However, there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human coronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2) via human milk and/or breastfeeding. There is a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human coronavirus 229E, a single study evaluating presence of SARS-CoV in human milk (it was negative), and no published data on MERS-CoV and human milk. There are 9 case studies of human milk tested for SARS-CoV-2; none detected the virus. Importantly, none of the published studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their analytical methods for use in human milk.

195,"A streamlined approach to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, avoiding RNA extraction","In the current pandemic, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples by nucleic acid (NA) molecular analysis is the only method available to diagnose COVID-19 disease and to assess patients' infectiveness. Recently, the demand for laboratory reagents has greatly increased; in particular, there is a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction kits. Here, we describe a fast, simple and inexpensive method for the detection of SARS CoV-2 RNA, which includes a pretreatment with Proteinase K and a heating-cooling cycle before the amplification. This method bypasses the RNA extraction step; it leads to a higher amount of available viral RNA compared to the automated extraction methods, and generates the same profile in the subsequent amplification phase.","Marzinotto, S.; Mio, C.; Cifu', A.; Verardo, R.; Pipan, C.; Schneider, C.; Curcio, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054114v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054114v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
196,Probability of current COVID-19 outbreaks in all US counties,"Without a coordinated state or federal response to COVID-19 across the United States, counties are left to weigh the potentially large yet unseen threat of COVID-19 with the economic and societal costs of enacting strict social distancing measures. The immediate and long-term risk of the virus can be difficult to grasp, given the lack of historical precedent and that many cases go undetected. We calculated the risk that there already is sustained community transmission that has not yet been detected. Given the low testing rates throughout the country, we assume that one in ten cases are tested and reported. If a county has detected only one case of COVID-19, there is a 51% chance that there is already a growing outbreak underway. COVID-19 is likely spreading in 72% of all counties in the US, containing 94% of the national population. Proactive social distancing, even before two cases are confirmed, is prudent.","Javan, E.; Fox, S. J.; Meyers, L.

197,"A Very Flat Peak: Exponential growth phase of COVID-19 is mostly followed by a prolonged linear growth phase, not an immediate saturation","When actively taking measures to control an epidemic, an important indicator of success is crossing the ""peak"" of daily new infections. The peak is a positive sign which marks the end of the exponential phase of infection spread and a transition into a phase that is a manageable. Most countries or provinces with similar but independent growth trajectories had taken drastic measures for containing the COVID-19 pandemic and are eagerly waiting to cross the peak. However, the data after many weeks of strict measures suggests that most provinces instead enter a phase where the infections are in a linear growth. While the transition out of an exponential phase is relieving, the roughly constant number of daily new infections differ widely, range from around 50 in Singapore to around 2000 just in Lombardy (Italy), and 7600 in Spain. The daily new infection rate of a region seems to depend heavily on the time point in the exponential evolution when the restrictive measures were adopted, rather than on the population of the region. It is not easy to point the critical source of these persistent infections. We attempt to interpret this data using a simple model of newer infections mediated by asymptomatic patients, which underscores the importance of actively identifying any potential leakages in the quarantine. Given the novelty of the virus, it is hard to predict too far into the future and one needs to be observant to see if a plan B is needed as a second round of interventions. So far, the peak achieved by most countries with the first round of intervention is extremely flat.","Ansumali, S.; Prakash, M.

Lung injury has been reported as the major outcome of COVID-19 infection. However, liver damage has also been considered to occur in severe cases. Current meta-analysis of retrospective studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between liver injury and severity of COVID-19 infection. Methods: Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 April 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, a fixed- or random-effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, publication bias test and sensitivity analysis were also done. Results: In total, 20 retrospective studies with 3,428 COVID-19 infected patients (severe cases = 1,455 and mild cases = 1,973), were included in this meta-analysis. Higher serum levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 8.84 U/L, 95% CI = 5.97 to 11.71, P<0.001), Alanine aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 7.35 U/L, 95% CI = 4.77 to 9.93, P<0.001), total Bilirubin (weighted mean difference = 2.30 mmol/L, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.36, P<0.001) and lower serum levels of Albumin (weighted mean difference = -4.24 g/L, 95% CI = -6.20 to -2.28, P<0.001), were associated with a significant increase in the severity of COVID-19 infection.

199,The Framework for the Prediction of the Critical Turning Period for Outbreak of COVID-19 Spread in China based on the iSEIR Model,"The goal of this study is to establish a general framework for predicting the so-called critical Turning Period in an infectious disease epidemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak in China early this year. This framework enabled a timely prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic and informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and timely actions to control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on turning period for the world's current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning. Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on flatting the epidemic curve by decisively imposing the Lockdown and Isolation Control Program in Wuhan since January 23, 2020.

200,The need of health policy perspective to protect Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 pandemic. A GRADE rapid review on the N95 respirators effectiveness.,"Background Protecting Health Care Workers (HCWs) during routine care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients is of paramount importance to halt the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2) pandemic. The WHO, ECDC and CDC have issued conflicting guidelines on the use of respiratory filters (N95) by HCWs. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to March 21, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of COVID-19 or any other respiratory infection among HCWs. The grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Findings Four RCTs involving 8736 HCWs were included. We did not find any trial specifically on prevention of COVID-19. However, wearing N95 respirators can prevent 73 more (95% CI 46-91) clinical respiratory infections per 1000 HCWs compared to surgical masks (2 RCTs; 2594 patients; low quality of evidence). A protective effect of N95 respirators in laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR= 0.41; 95%CI 0.28-0.61) was also found. A trend in favour of N95 respirators was observed in preventing laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza like illness. Interpretation We found no direct high quality evidence on whether N95 respirators are better than surgical masks for HCWs protection from SARS-CoV-2. However, low quality evidence suggests that N95 respirators protect HCWs from clinical respiratory infections. This finding should be contemplated to decide the best strategy to support the resilience of healthcare systems facing the potentially catastrophic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Iannone, P.; Castellini, G.; Coclite, D.; Napoletano, A.; Fauci, A.; Iacorossi, L.; D'Angelo, D.; Renzi, C.; La Torre, G.; Mastroianni, C.; Gianola, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054841v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054841v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True

202,Three adjacent nucleotide changes spanning two residues in SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein: possible homologous recombination from the transcription-regulating sequence,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the single-stranded RNA virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus of zoonotic origin that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. There is evidence that homologous recombination contributed to this cross-species transmission. Since that time the virus has demonstrated a high propensity for human-to-human transmission. Here we report two newly identified adjacent amino acid polymorphisms in the nucleocapsid at positions 203 and 204 (R203K/G204R) due to three adjacent nucleotide changes across the two codons (i.e. AGG GGA to AAA CGA). This new strain within the LGG clade may have arisen by a form of homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS-B) of the transcription-regulating sequences of SAS-CoV-2 itself and has rapidly increased to approximately one third of reported sequences from Europe during the month of March 2020. We note that these polymorphisms are predicted to reduce the binding of an overlying putative HLA-C*07-restricted epitope and that HLA-C*07 is prevalent in Caucasians being carried by >40% of the population. The findings suggest that homologous recombination may have occurred since its introduction into humans and be a mechanism for increased viral fitness and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to human populations.","Leary, S.; Gaudieri, S.; Chopra, A.; Pakala, S.; Alves, E.; John, M.; Das, S.; Mallal, S.; Phillips, P.

204,Potential host range of multiple SARS-like coronaviruses and an improved ACE2-Fc variant that is potent against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a currently uncontrolled pandemic and the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is important to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. Here we show that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild animals support entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, bat coronavirus RaTG13, and a coronavirus isolated from pangolins. Some of these species, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human transmission, and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of COVID-19. We show that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 entry could be potently blocked by recombinant IgG Fc-fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Moreover, an ACE2-Fc variant, which carries a D30E mutation and has ACE2 truncated at its residue 740 but not 615, outperforms all the other ACE2-Fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses. Our data suggest that RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc could be used to treat and prevent infection of SARS-CoV-2 and any new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.","Li, Y.; Wang, H.; Tang, X.; Ma, D.; Du, C.; Wang, Y.; Pan, H.; Zou, Q.; Zheng, J.; Xu, L.; Farzan, M.; Zhong, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.032342v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.032342v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,False
205,De novo design of high-affinity antibody variable regions (scFv) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the pandemic of respiratory disease known as COVID-19, which emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China in late 2019. Both vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking. Viral entry requires binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). In an earlier paper1, we report on the specific residue interactions underpinning this event. Here we report on the de novo computational design of high affinity antibody variable regions through the recombination of VDJ genes targeting the most solvent-exposed ACE2-binding residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the software tool OptMAVEn-2.02. Subsequently, we carry out computational affinity maturation of the designed prototype variable regions through point mutations for improved binding with the target epitope. Immunogenicity was restricted by preferring designs that match sequences from a 9-mer library of ""human string content"" (HSC)3. We generated 60 different variable region designs and report in detail on the top five that trade-off the greatest affinity for the spike epitope (quantified using the Rosetta binding energies) with low immunogenicity scores. By grafting these designed variable regions with frameworks, high-affinity monoclonal antibodies can be constructed. Having a potent antibody that can recognize the viral spike protein with high affinity would be enabling for both the design of sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection devices and for their deployment as neutralizing antibodies.","Boorla, V.

By analyzing 106 SARS-CoV-2 and 39 SARS genome sequences, we provided direct genetic evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has a much lower mutation rate than SARS. Minimum Evolution phylogeny analysis revealed the putative original status of SARS-CoV-2 and the early-stage spread history. The discrepant phylogenies for the spike protein and its receptor binding domain proved a previously reported structural rearrangement prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Despite that we found the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is particularly more conserved, we identified a mutation that leads to weaker receptor binding capability, which concerns a SARS-CoV-2 sample collected on 27th January 2020 from India.

The genomes of SARS-COV-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently. Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

The most notable enrichment of IRs was found inside 5'UTR for IRs of size 12+ nucleotides, and the most notable enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3'UTR, inside 5'UTR, and before mRNA. This indicates crucial regulatory roles for both IRs and PQSs. Moreover, we found multiple G-quadruplex binding motifs in human proteins having potential for binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

211,A virus that has gone viral: Amino acid mutation in S protein of Indian isolate of Coronavirus COVID-19 might impact receptor binding and thus infectivity,"Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 late in 2019 (also named as COVID-19 or novel coronavirus 2019 or nCoV2019. Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407.

212,Prediction on Covid-19 epidemic for different countries: Focusing on South Asia under various precautionary measures,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged from Wuhan, China, is now a pandemic, affecting across the globe. Government of different countries have developed and adopted various policies to contain this epidemic and the most common were the social distancing and lockdown. We proposed a SEIR epidemic model that accommodates the effects of lockdown and individual based precautionary measures and used it to estimate model parameters from the epidemic data up to 2nd April, 2020, freely available in GitHub repository for COVID-19, for nine developed and developing countries. We used the estimated parameters to predict the disease burden in these countries with special emphasis on India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Our analysis revealed that the lockdown and recommended individual hygiene can slow down the outbreak but unable to eradicate the disease from the society. With the current human-to-human transmission rate and existing level of personal precautionary, the number of infected individuals in India will be increasing at least for the next 3 months and the peak will come in 5 months. We can, however, reduce the epidemic size and prolong the time to arrive epidemic peak by seriously following the measures suggested by the authorities. We need to wait for another one month to obtain more data and epidemiological parameters for giving a better prediction about the pandemic. It is to be mentioned that research community is working for drugs and/ or vaccines against COVID19 and the presence of such pharmaceutical interventions will significantly alter the results.","Paul, A.; Chatterjee, S.; Bairagi, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20055095v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20055095v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
213,Accounting for incomplete testing in the estimation of epidemic parameters,"As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves across the world and the United States, it is important to understand its evolution in real time and at regional levels. The field of infectious diseases epidemiology has highly developed modeling and estimation strategies that yield relevant estimates. These include the doubling time of the epidemic, i.e., the number of days until the number of cases doubles, and various representations of the number of cases over time, including the epidemic curve and associated cumulative incidence curve. While these quantities are immediately estimable given current data, they suffer from dependence on the underlying testing strategies within communities. Specifically, they are inextricably tied to the likelihood that an infected individual is tested and identified as a case. We clarify the functional relationship between testing and the epidemic parameters of interest, and thereby demonstrate simply sensitivity analyses that explore the range of possible truths under various testing scenarios. We demonstrate that crude estimates that assume stable testing or complete testing can be overly-optimistic.","Betensky, R.

214,Exercising caution in correlating COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates with BCG vaccination policies due to variable rates of SARS CoV-2 testing,"TThe Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against tuberculosis (TB), and is proposed to provide protection to non-TB infectious diseases. The COVID-19 outbreak results from infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) and was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. We queried whether the BCG vaccine offers protection against CoV-2 infection. We observed that countries with a current universal BCG vaccination policy have a significantly lower COVID-19 incidence than countries which never had a universal BCG policy or had one in the past. However, population density, median age, TB incidence, urban population, and, most significantly, CoV-2 testing rate, were also connected with BCG policy and could potentially confound the analysis. By limiting the analysis to countries with high CoV-2 testing rates, defined as greater than 2,500 tests per million inhabitants, these parameters were no longer statistically associated with BCG policy. When analyzing only countries with high testing rates, there was no longer a significant association between the number of COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants and the BCG vaccination policy. Although preliminary, our analyses indicate that the BCG vaccination may not offer protection against CoV-2 infection. While reporting biases may confound our observations, our findings support exercising caution in determining potential correlation between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 incidence, in part due significantly lower rates of CoV-2 testing per million inhabitants in countries with current universal BCG vaccination policy.","Hensel, J.; McGrail, D.

As a designated hospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital has received over 700 COVID-19 patients. With the COVID-19 becoming a pandemic all over the world, we aim to share our epidemiological and clinical findings with the global community. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we studied 340 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, including 310 discharged cases and 30 death cases. We analyzed their demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and implemented our findings into an interactive, free access web application. Findings Baseline T lymphocyte Subsets differed significantly between the discharged cases and the death cases in two-sample t-tests: Total T cells (p < 2.2e-16), Helper T cells (p < 2.2e-16), Suppressor T cells (p = 1.8-14), and TH/TS (Helper/Suppressor ratio, p = 0.0066). Multivariate logistic regression model with death or discharge as the outcome resulted in the following significant predictors: age (OR 1.05, p 0.04), underlying disease status (OR 3.42, p 0.02), Helper T cells on the log scale (OR 0.22, p 0.00), and TH/TS on the log scale (OR 4.80, p 0.00). The McFadden pseudo R-squared for the logistic regression model is 0.35, suggesting the model has a fair predictive power. Interpretation While age and underlying diseases are known risk factors for poor prognosis, patients with a less damaged immune system at the time of hospitalization had higher chance of recovery. Close monitoring of the T lymphocyte subsets might provide valuable information of the patients condition change during the treatment process.

218,"Blood glucose is a representative of the clustered indicators of multi-organ injury for predicting mortality of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","OBJECTIVE Most patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were Mild or Moderate. Severe patients progressed rapidly to Critical condition including multi-organ failure and even death. Identification of early predictive factors is urgently necessary to facilitate appropriate intensive care. METHODS We included all patient admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital and treated by the supportive medical team of Beijing Tongren Hospital as of March 20, 2020. Indicators of injuries for multiple organs, including the heart, kidney and liver, and glucose homeostasis were specifically analyzed for predicting primary outcomes (an intensive care unit (ICU) or death). RESULTS The data of 120 patients with a severity equal to or greater than Moderate, discharged or died were extracted. After excluding patients with history of diabetes, chronic heart, kidney, and liver disease, 69 patients were included in the final analysis. There were 26 cases with primary outcomes including 16 deaths. Univariable analysis indicated that fasting blood glucose (FBG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), creatine kinase and creatinine were associated with primary outcomes and death. Among patients with primary outcomes, although FBG levels were much higher on admission, they dramatically decreased subsequently, while in deceased patients they increased continuously. Multivariable Cox regression indicated that FBG[&ge;]7mmol/L was the only independent predictor for death (HR = 3.75, 95% CI 1.26-11.15). Cluster analysis found more proximities of FBG (at the time of admission) with LDH, HDDH or Creatinine (after 2-4 days of hospitalization) (r=0.43, 0.43 and 0.50, respectively, P<0.01 for all). Conclusions Blood glucose is a representative of the clustered indicators of multi-organ injury and earlier predictor for poor outcomes and death in the COVID patients. As it is easy to perform for clinical practices and self-monitoring, glucose testing will be much helpful for predicting poor outcomes to facilitate appropriate intensive care.","Yang, J.-K.; Jin, J.-M.; Liu, S.; Bai, P.; He, W.; Wu, F.; Liu, X.-F.; Han, D.-M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058040v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058040v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True

We aimed to bridge the gap between disease classification and clinical outcome in intensive care patients, data of which are scarce and such classification could help in individual evaluation and provide effective triage for treatment and management. Specifically, we collected and filtered out 151 intensive care patients with complete medical records from Tongji hospital in Wuhan, China. We constructed a fully Bayesian latent variable model for integrative clustering of six data categories, including demographic information, symptoms, original comorbidities, vital signs, blood routine tests and inflammatory marker measurements. We identified four prognostic types of COVID-19 in intensive care patients, presenting a stepwise distribution in age, respiratory condition and inflammatory markers, suggesting the prognostic efficacy of these indicators. This report, to our knowledge, is the first attempt of dealing with classification of COVID-19 in intensive care patients. We acknowledge the limitation of ignoring the effect of treatment, but we believe such classification is enlightening for better triage, allowing for a more rational allocation of scarce medical resources in a resource constrained environment.","Lu, X.; Wang, Y.; Chen, T.; Li, Y.; Wang, J.; Yan, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058909v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058909v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True

Methods: This observational study included data from all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China between January 5 and March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was cutoff on March 8, 2020. Results: A total of 274 patients, 75 with hypertension and 199 without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Patients with hypertension were older and were more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease than patients without hypertension. Moreover, patients with hypertension tended to have higher positive COVID-19 PCR detection rates. Patients with hypertension who had previously taken ACEI/ARB drugs for antihypertensive treatment have an increased tendency to develop severe pneumonia after infection with SARS-COV-2 (P = 0.064). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with hypertension were significantly older and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease.

While the analogous event in China appears to be rather under control at the moment, the outbreaks in western countries are still at an early stage of the evolution. Italy at present is playing a major role in understanding transmission dynamics of these new infections and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures in a western social context. Methods: We combined a quarantined models with early stage evolution data in Italy (during February 20th - March 30th) to predict longer term evolution (March 30th, on ...) within different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnose rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1. Within the same framework we analyze the possible event of a secondary infection after relaxing the isolation measures. Outcomes and interpretation: We study two simplified scenarios compatible with the observation data and the effects of two stringent measures on the evolution of the epidemic. On one side the contact rate must obviously kept as low as possible, but it is also clear that, in a modern developed country, it cannot fall under certain minimum levels and for long time. The complementary parameter tuned is the transition rate of the symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined class, a parameter {delta}_I connected with the time t_I=1/{delta}_I needed to perform diagnostic tests. Within the conditions of the outbreak in Italy this time must fall under 12-8 hours in order to make the reproduction number less than 1 to minimize the case numbers. Moreover we show how the same parameter plays an even more relevant role in mitigating the effects of a possible secondary infection event.","Traini, M. C.; Caponi, C.; Ferrari, R.; De Socio, G.

228,Alternative Qualitative Fit Testing Method for N95 Equivalent Respirators in the Setting of Resource Scarcity at the George Washington University,"The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused an acute shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) globally as well as shortage in the ability to test PPE such as respirator fit testing. This limits not only the ability to fit PPE to medical practitioners, but also the ability to rapidly prototype and produce alternative sources of PPE as it is difficult to validate fit. At the George Washington University, we evaluated an easily sourced method of qualitative fit testing using a nebulizer or atomizer and a sodium saccharin solution in water. If aerosolized saccharin entered candidate masks due to poor fit or inadequate filtration, then a sweet taste was detected in the mouth of the user. This method was tested against previously fit tested Milwaukee N95 and 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator as a positive control. A Chinese sourced KN95, cotton cloth material, and surgical mask were tested as other masks of interest. Sensitivity testing was done with no mask prior to fit test. A sweet taste was detected for both the surgical mask and cotton cloth, demonstrating a lack of seal. However, there was no sweet taste detected for the Milwaukee N95, 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator, or Chinese KN95. These results demonstrate this could be a valuable methodology for rapid prototyping, evaluation, and validation of fit in a non-clinical environment for use in creation of PPE. This method should be not be used without confirmation in a formal qualitative or quantitative fit test but can be used to preserve those resources until developers are confident that potential new N95 comparable respirators will pass. We strongly suggest validation of masks and respirators with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) approved fit testing prior to use in a clinical environment.","Provenzano, D.; Rao, Y.

The number of new Covid19 cases detected daily was modelized to fit with the last known data in France and extrapolated for the coming days using two scenarios following the existing data in China (best scenario) and Italy (worst scenario). The number of daily admissions in ICU was calculated as the sum of 13.7% of the new Covid19 cases detected on a given day and 7.8% of the average of the total new Covid-19 cases recorded in the last week. Approximately 39.7% of patients admitted to the ICU were non-intubated with an average ICU length of stay of 4 days. Conversely, 60.3% of patients were intubated and for those who died among them (14.44%) the ICU length of stay was of 4 days for 78.3% of them and of 15 days for 21.7% of them. For the intubated patients that were discharged alive, the ICU length of stay was of 6 days for 44.4% of them and of 20 days for 55.6% of them. RESULTS: We predict a peak of between 7072 and 8043 patients for the overall French territory. CONCUSION: Despite a simplified mathematical model, the strength of our study is a narrow possible range of predicted total number of ICU patients.","CIVIDJIAN, A.; Wallet, F.; Guichon, C.; Martin, O.; Couray-Targe, S.; Thomas, R.; Wey, P.-F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056226v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056226v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
230,Use of a Single Ventilator to Support Multiple Patients: Modeling Tidal Volume Response to Heterogeneous Lung Mechanics,"The COVID-19 pandemic is creating ventilator shortages in many countries that is sparking a conversation about placing multiple people on a single ventilator. However, on March 26th the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), along with other leading medical organizations, released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, several hospitals around the United States and abroad are turning to this technique out of desperation (e.g. New York), but little data exists to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (Vt). Methods: We developed a single compartment computational model of four patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance (C) and resistance (R) would impact Vt under 5 ventilator settings of pre-set PIP, PEEP, and I:E ratio (suggested by Farkas, J.D. MD as an approach by hospitals to manage multiple patients on a single ventilator). Results: Our computational model predicts Vt within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by more than one patient. Conclusions: Assigning patients to pre-set ventilators based on their lung mechanics could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any pre-clinical/clinical data. Therefore, clinicians considering this approach should not look to our study as an exact estimate of predicted patient tidal volumes.","Kheyfets, V.

231,Oxygen transfer characteristics of a hollow fiber dialyser: toward possible repurposing of dialysers as blood oxygenators in the context of constrained availability of respiratory support,"The mass transfer characteristics for oxygen from the gas phase to blood in a hollow fiber renal dialysis unit was investigated in vitro with a view to using such devices to effect respiratory support in patients with viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In our in vitro experiments, which were severely curtailed by prevailing circumstances, we used water as a substitute on the blood side. The water was saturated rapidly indicating that the system was flow limited rather than diffusion limited for oxygen transfer. Using these findings, we estimated the expected performance with blood and the results suggest that two dialysis units operating in parallel with a pure oxygen gas supply running counter-current to the blood flow, could supply up to 40% of the total required oxygen demand rate in an adult patient. While not studied, carbon dioxide elimination is likely to be feasible as well. It is thus possible that hollow fiber dialysis units operating with suitable roller pumps in a veno-venous access configuration, could serve as a cost-effective and readily available alternative or adjunct for respiratory support in the face of severe resource constraints. Verification and extension of our study is needed by well resourced laboratories who are still able to function during this unprecedented period of restrictions. If, after further studies and clinical considerations, this approach appears feasible, then consideration may be given to clinical deployment of this tech- nique in desperate situations where no alternative exists to preserve life.","Rubin, D.

232,Modelling the impact of COVID-19 in Australia to inform transmission reducing measures and health system preparedness,"Background The ability of global health systems to cope with increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases is of major concern. In readiness for this challenge, Australia has drawn on clinical pathway models developed over many years in preparation for influenza pandemics. These models have been used to estimate health care requirements for COVID-19 patients, in the context of broader public health measures. Methods An age and risk stratified transmission model of COVID-19 infection was used to simulate an unmitigated epidemic with parameter ranges reflecting uncertainty in current estimates of transmissibility and severity. Overlaid public health measures included case isolation and quarantine of contacts, and broadly applied social distancing. Clinical presentations and patient flows through the Australian health care system were simulated, including expansion of available intensive care capacity and alternative clinical assessment pathways. Findings An unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic would dramatically exceed the capacity of the Australian health system, over a prolonged period. Case isolation and contact quarantine alone will be insufficient to constrain case presentations within a feasible level of expansion of health sector capacity. Overlaid social restrictions will need to be applied at some level over the course of the epidemic to ensure that systems do not become overwhelmed, and that essential health sector functions, including care of COVID-19 patients, can be maintained. Attention to the full pathway of clinical care is needed to ensure access to critical care. Interpretation Reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality will rely on a combination of measures to strengthen and extend public health and clinical capacity, along with reduction of overall infection transmission in the community. Ongoing attention to maintaining and strengthening the capacity of health care systems and workers to manage cases is needed.","Moss, R.; Wood, J.; Brown, D.; Shearer, F.; Black, A.

233,Outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, a global pandemic. In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n=30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56+/-0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47+/-0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82+/-2.95 days. We assume that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific and the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different communities, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n=50 states, we adopted the latent and infectious periods from China, and found a contact period of 3.38+/-0.69 days. With no additional mitigation strategies, our epidemic network model predicts a basic reproduction number of 5.3+/-0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections across the United States. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lock down, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.","Peirlinck, M.; Sahli Costabal, F.; Linka, K.; Kuhl, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055863v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055863v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
234,Key to successful treatment of COVID-19: accurate identification of severe risks and early intervention of disease progression,"Abstract Background COVID-19 is a new and highly contagious respiratory disease that has caused global spread, high case fatality rate in severe patients, and a huge medical burden due to invasive mechanical ventilation. The current diagnosis and treatment guidelines are still need to be improved, and more excellent clinical experience is needed to provide reference. Methods We analyzed and summarized clinical data of 97 confirmed COVID-19 adult patients (including 26 severe cases) admitted to the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 17, 2020 to March 10, 2020,included laboratory examination results, imaging findings, treatment effect, prognosis , etc, in order to put forward prediction index of severe COVID-19 patients, principles of early intervention and methylprednisolone usages in COVID-19 patients. Results 1.Hypoxemia, hyperlactic acid, hypoproteinemia, and hypokalemia were prevalent in COVID-19 patients.The significant low lymphocyte count, hypoproteinemia, hypokalemia, the persistent or worsen high CRP, high D-dimer, and high BNP, and the occurrence of hemoptysis and novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) viremia were important indicators for early diagnosis and prediction of severe disease progression. 2.Characteristic images of lung CT had a clear change in COVID - 19, Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and high-density linear combinations may indicate different pathological changes. Rapid lobular progression of GGO suggests the possibility of severe disease. 3.Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID-19: on the premise of no effective antiviral drugs, treatment is based on supportive and symptomatic therapy (albumin supplementation, supplement of potassium, supplement blood plasma, etc.) in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to clean up SARS-CoV-2 . 4. According to severity, oxygenation index, body weight, age, underlying diseases, appropriate amount methylprednisolone application on severe/critical COVID-19 patients on demand, improved blood oxygen and reduced the utilization rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, case fatality rate and medical burden significantly. The most common indications for invasive mechanical ventilation should be strictly control in critical COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: 1.Accurate and timely identification of clinical features in severe risks, and early and appropriate intervention can block disease progression. 2.Appropriate dose of methylprednisolone can effectively avoid invasive mechanical ventilation and reduce case fatality rate in critical COVID-19 patients.","chen, m.; tu, c.; Tan, C.; Zheng, X.; wang, x.; wu, j.; Huang, Y.; wang, z.; yan, y.; li, z.; shan, h.; Liu, J.; huang, j.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054890v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054890v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
235,Adjuvant corticosteroid therapy for critically ill patients with COVID-19,"Addition of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy to standard antiviral treatment of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is common in clinical practice. However, evidence is scarce regarding the efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids in patients who are critically ill. We retrospectively evaluated the effects of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment on the outcome of 244 critically ill patients with COVID-19, using a risk stratification model that adjusts for potential differences between the steroid group (n=151) and the non-steroid group (n=93). We observed that adjuvant corticosteroid therapy was independent from 28-day mortality, either in multivariate logistic regression of the entire cohort after adjustment for major mortality-associated variables (age, SpO2/FiO2, and lymphocyte count) and individual propensity score (adjusted OR: 1.05; 95% CI: -1.92-2.01), or in propensity score-matched (1:1 without replacement) case-control analysis (62 patients in 31 pairs; log-rank test P=0.17). Additionally, subgroup analyses of 147 (60%) patients who had dyspnea and 87 (36%) patients who had ARDS revealed corticosteroid treatment was not associated with clinical outcome (both, P>0.3). However, increased corticosteroids dosage was significantly associated with elevated mortality risk after adjustment for administration duration (P=0.003); every ten-milligram increase in hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage was associated with additional 4% mortality risk (adjusted HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07). Our findings indicated that limited effect of corticosteroid therapy could pose to overall survival and prudent dose within effective limits may be recommended for critically ill patients under certain circumstances.","Lu, X.; Chen, T.; Wang, Y.; Wang, J.; Zhang, B.; Li, Y.; Yan, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056390v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056390v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
236,"Gaussian Statistics and Data-Assimilated Model of Mortality due to COVID-19: China, USA, Italy, Spain, UK, Iran, and the World Total","Covid-19 is characterized by rapid transmission and severe symptoms, leading to deaths in some cases (ranging from 1.5 to 12% of the affected, depending on the country). We identify the Gaussian nature of mortality due to covid-19, as shown in China where it appears to have run its course (during the first sweep of the pandemic at least) and other coutnries, and also in Imperial College modeling. Gaussian distribution involves three parameters, the height, peak location and the width, and the streaming data can be used to infer function value, slope and inflection location as a minimum set of constraints to estimate the subsequent trajectories. Thus, we apply the Gaussian function template as the basis for a data-assimilated model of covid-19 trajectories, first to USA, United Kingdom (UK), Iran and the world total in this study. As more data become available, the Gaussian trajectories are updated, for other nations and also for state-by-state projections in USA.","Lee, T.- W.; Park, J.

238,ESTIMATING COVID-19 INFECTIONS IN HOSPITAL WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES,"Objective: We estimated that how many hospital workers in the United States (US) might get infected or die in the COVID-19 pandemic. We also estimated the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) and age restrictions on these estimates. Methods: Our secondary analyses estimated hospital worker infections in the US based on health worker infection and death rates per 100 deaths from COVID-19 in Hubei and Italy. We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker infections in the US based on the two scenarios. We computed potential decrease in infections if the PPE were available only to those involved in direct care of COVID-19 patients (~ 30%) and if workers aged [&ge;] 60 years are restricted from patient care. Estimates were adjusted for hospital workers per bed in the US compared to China and Italy. Results: The hospital worker infections per 100 deaths were 108.2 in Hubei and 94.1 in Italy. Based on Hubei scenario, we estimated that about 53,640 US hospital workers (95% CI: 43,160 to 62,251) might get infected from COVID-19. The Italian scenario suggested 53,097 US hospital worker (95% CI: 37,133 to 69,003) might get infected during the pandemic. Availability of PPE to high-risk workers could reduce counts to 28,100 (95% CI: 23,048 to 33,242) considering Hubei and to 28,354 (95% CI: 19,829 to 36,848) considering Italy. Restricting hospital workers aged [&ge;] 60 years from direct patient care reduced counts to 1,985 (95% CI: 1,627 to 2,347) considering Hubei and to 2,002 (95% CI: 1,400 to 2,602) considering the Italian scenario. Conclusion: We estimated significant burden of illness due to COVID-19 if no strategies are adopted. Making PPE available to all hospital workers and reducing exposure of hospital workers above the age of 60 could have significant reductions in hospital worker infections.","Razzak, J. A.; Bhatti, J.

239,Efficient network immunization under limited knowledge,"Targeted immunization or attacks of large-scale networks has attracted significant attention by the scientific community. However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these n nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until 1-p fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold pc and the size of the giant component P{infty} for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n[-&gt;]{infty} we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for n=1 we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, pc increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between |pc({infty}) -pc (n)| and n as |pc({infty}) -pc (n)|~n-1exp(- n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k)~k-{gamma},2<{gamma}<3), we find that pc has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n=1 to order of logN (N is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of logN nodes and immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.","Liu, Y.; Sanhedrai, H.; Dong, G.; Shekhtman, L. M.; Wang, F.; Buldyrev, S.

241,The efficiency in the ordinary hospital bed management in Italy: an in-depth analysis of intensive care unit in the areas affected by COVID-19 before the outbreak,"In the first months of 2020 an increasing number of individuals worldwide are infected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A particularly severe diffusion of the virus has affected Italy and in particular its northern regions. This is resulting in a high demand of hospitalization with a particular attention on the intensive care units (ICUs). Hospitals are suffering the high degree of patients to be treated for respiratory diseases and the majority of the structures located in the north of Italy are or are going to be saturated. This has led the actual and past national and regional governments to be heavily criticized for reducing in the past years the number of beds, in particular those located in the ICUs across the country. Aim of this study is to analyse the availability of hospital beds across the country as well as to determine their management in terms of complexity and performance of cases treated at regional level. The results of this study underlines that, despite the reduction of beds for the majority of the hospital wards, ICUs availabilities did not change between 2010 and 2017. Moreover, this study confirms that the majority of the Italian regions efficiently manage these structural facilities allowing hospitals to treat patients without the risk of having an overabundance of patients and a scarcity of beds. In fact, this analysis shows that, in normal situations, the management of hospital and intensive care beds has no critical levels.","Pecoraro, F.; Clemente, F.; Luzi, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055848v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055848v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True

A model-based estimation,"Amid SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the low number of infections for a population size of 1.38 billion is widely discussed, but with no definite answers. In this context, we used the model proposed by Bommer and Vollmer to assess the quality of official case records. The findings suggest that India is detecting just 3.6% of the total number of infections with a huge variation across its states. As we found that a lower number of deaths in the states with a high detection rate, thus suggest that India must enhance its testing capacity and go for widespread testing. Late detection puts patients in greater need of mechanical ventilation and ICU care, which imposes greater costs on the health system. Early detection and avoidance of critical care for a majority of infected patients is an important way of avoiding overcrowding on the limited health care resources available in the country. The country should also adopt population-level random testing to assess the prevalence of the infection.","Goli, S.; James, K.

We found that the duration of an epidemic wave (99% of total size) was usually between 45-48 days. Using data up to April 6, 2020, we found in six of 20 counties two waves, spaced between 21 and 47 days. In China and Korea the first wave was bigger, and in Denmark, Iran, Japan, and Sweden the second wave was stronger. Lag time between time trends in confirmed infections and time trends in deaths varied between 3.1 and 9.5 days. We obtained a good fit between observed and modelled data in almost all countries. In about halve of the countries the highest peak of the COVID-19 epidemic had been reached until April 6, 2020. Among the 20 countries, it is predicted that the USA will reach the highest numbers of confirmed infections (653 683-802 205) and number of deaths (36 591-53 286). Taken together, for many countries reasonable and up-to-date forecasting seems to be feasible. This method therefore bears a high potential for assisting decision makers to adjust the measures aiming at reducing the spread of the virus appropriately.","Nordt, C.; Herdener, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056481v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056481v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
247,"Early estimates of COVID-19 infections in small, medium and large population clusters","Since its emergence in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly developed into a pandemic with many countries declaring emergency conditions to contain its spread. The impact of the disease, while has been relatively low in the Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) so far, is expected to be devastating given the less developed and fragmented health care system in the continent. In addition, most emergency measures such as border closings, cancellations of inbound flights, social distancing, and promotion of hand hygiene may not be as effective due to the clustered way people live in large as well as smaller population centers. As SSA waits for the start of large epidemics as seem in other regions, there exist acute need for estimates of the potential impacts of the disease once it gets strong hold in the region. To address this need, we developed a mathematical model with key parameters obtained from recent studies, to estimate the number of infections with in the first 90 days of the transmission under different scenarios of population sizes, initial number of cases, and coverage of contact tracing and isolation. Our results show that if implemented early, 80% contact tracing may ""flattens the curve"" of local epidemics, brings the pandemic to a manageable level for all population sizes we assessed. In countries with limited workforce, hospital resources and ICU care, a robust contact tracing program could yield in outcomes that prevent several millions of infections and thousands of deaths across the continent.","Siraj, D.

248,A first study on the impact of current and future control measures on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), identified in China at the end of December 2019 and causing the disease COVID-19, has meanwhile led to outbreaks all over the globe, with about 571,700 confirmed cases and about 26,500 deaths as of March 28th, 2020. We present here the preliminary results of a mathematical study directed at informing on the possible application or lifting of control measures in Germany. The developed mathematical models allow to study the spread of COVID-19 among the population in Germany and to asses the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The overall goal is to suggest strategies for the mitigation of the current outbreak, slowing down the spread of the virus and thus reducing the peak in daily diagnosed cases, the demand for hospitalization or intensive care units admissions, and eventually fatalities.","Barbarossa, M.

250,"Mental health status of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak in Jordan: a cross-sectional study","Background: The emergence of COVID-19 global pandemic coupled with high transmission rate and mortality has created an unprecedented state of emergency worldwide. This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well-being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals performance. Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22nd and 28th of March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%. Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression. Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income ([&ge;]1500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. Conclusions: During outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide further mental support to these vulnerable groups during this pandemic.","Naser, A. Y.; Dahmash, E.

251,COVID-19: Tracking the Pandemic with A Simple Curve Approximation Tool (SCAT),"Background In the current COVID-19 pandemic, much focus is put on 'flattening the curve'. This epidemiological 'curve' refers to the cases versus time graph, which shows the rise of a disease to its peak before descending. The aim in a pandemic is to flatten this curve by reducing the peak and spreading out the timeline. However, the models used to predict this curve are often not clearly outlined, no model parameters are given, and models are not tested against real data. This lack of detail makes it difficult to recreate the curve. What is much needed is a simple tool for approximating the curve to allow ideas to be tested and comparisons made. Methods This work presents a Simple Curve Approximation Tool (SCAT) which can be used by anyone. This tool allows the user to approximate and draw the curve and allows testing of assumptions, trajectories and the wildly varying figures reported in the media. The mathematics behind SCAT is clearly outlined here but understanding of this is not required. SCAT is provided online as a downloadable MS Excel workbook with some sample cases shown. Throughout this work, the parameters used are specified so that all results can be easily reproduced. Findings Although not intended as a prediction tool, SCAT has achieved less than 0.5 % error in short-term forward prediction. It also shows a very significant improvement on the pandemic exponential approximations found throughout media reporting. As a comparison tool, it highlights obvious differences between COVID-19 and other diseases, such as influenza, and between countries at different stages of the pandemic (China, Italy and the UK are used here for demonstration purposes). Interpretation SCAT allows for quick approximation of the curve and creates meaningful comparisons and understandable visualisations for COVID-19 and other diseases.

252,"Chloroquine diphosphate in two different dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with severe respiratory syndrome in the context of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection: Preliminary safety results of a randomized, double-blinded, phase IIb clinical trial (CloroCovid-19 Study)","Summary Background There is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. Methods We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527. Findings Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc>500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient. Interpretation Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards. Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm. Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations.","Borba, M.; Val, F. d.

253,A Comprehensive Analysis of COVID-19 Outbreak situation in India,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in different parts of the world is a major concern for all the administrative units of respective countries. India is also facing this very tough task for controlling the virus outbreak and has managed its growth rate through some strict measures. This study presents the current situation of coronavirus spread in India along with the impact of various measures taken for it. With the help of data sources (till 7th-8th April 2020) from various state units of India and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, this study presents various trends and patterns. This study answers six different research ques-tions in a comprehensive manner. It has been reported that growth rate of infected cases has been controlled with the help of National Lockdown, however some uncontrolled mass level events had negatively impacted the infected cases. With the help of exponential and polyno-mial regression modelling, the predictions of up to 75000 cases have been done by the end of April 2020. It has also been seen that there are some prominent clusters and patient nodes in the network of patients which are the major influencers for COVID-19 spread. Also, death rate case predictions have been done through multi-class classification models with an accuracy of 75%. At the end, strategies for continuation for lockdown has been discussed and presented. It appears that only essential services should be open for the citizens of India and the national lockdown should be carried on for next 2-4 weeks. This study will be useful for the Government of India and various states of India, Administrative Units of India, Frontline health workforce of India, researchers and scientists.

254,Work-related Covid-19 transmission,"Importance: Our study helps fill the knowledge gap related to work-related transmission in the emerging coronaviral pandemic. Objective: To demonstrate high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) local transmission. Methods: In this observational study, we extracted confirmed Covid-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We followed each country/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period). Results: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals). Conclusions: Work-related transmission is considerable in early Covid-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW.

258,Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in Italy and estimates of the reproductive numbers one month into the epidemic,"Background In February 2020, a locally-acquired COVID-19 case was detected in Lombardia, Italy. This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. The outbreak rapidly escalated to a national level epidemic, amid the WHO declaration of a pandemic. Methods We analysed data from the national case-based integrated surveillance system of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections as of March 24th 2020, collected from all Italian regions and autonomous provinces. Here we provide a descriptive epidemiological summary on the first 62,843 COVID-19 cases in Italy as well as estimates of the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. Findings Of the 62,843 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 71.6% were reported from three Regions (Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). All cases reported after February 20th were locally acquired. Estimates of R0 varied between 2.5 (95%CI: 2.18-2.83) in Toscana and 3 (95%CI: 2.68-3.33) in Lazio, with epidemic doubling time of 3.2 days (95%CI: 2.3-5.2) and 2.9 days (95%CI: 2.2-4.3), respectively. The net reproduction number showed a decreasing trend starting around February 20-25, 2020 in northern regions. Notably, 5,760 cases were reported among health care workers. Of the 5,541 reported COVID-19 associated deaths, 49% occurred in people aged 80 years or above with an overall crude CFR of 8.8%. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Interpretation The COVID-19 infection in Italy emerged with a clustering onset similar to the one described in Wuhan, China and likewise showed worse outcomes in older males with comorbidities. Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia, explains the high case-load and rapid geographical spread observed. Overall Rt in Italian regions is currently decreasing albeit with large diversities across the country, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.","Riccardo, F.; Ajelli, M.; Andrianou, X.; Bella, A.; Del Manso, M.; Fabiani, M.; Bellino, S.; Boros, S.; Mateo Urdiales, A.; Marziano, V.; Rota, M.

259,Temporal rise in the proportion of both younger adults and older adolescents among COVID-19 cases in Germany: evidence of lesser adherence to social distancing practices?,"Background: There is uncertainty about the role of different age groups in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in different countries, particularly under current social distancing practices. Methods: We used the Robert Koch Institute data on weekly COVID-19 cases in different age groups in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior (e.g. for older adults) and testing practices, we included the following eight 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period), as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period), and defined the relative risk RR(g) for the age group g to be the ratio RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2), or, alternatively, a value above 1 for the odds ratio OR(g1,g2)=RR(g1)/RR(g2) for a COVID-19 case to be in group g1 vs. g2 for the later vs. early periods is interpreted as the relative increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 in the age group g1 compared to g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk RR(g) was highest for individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y (RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). For the age group 20-24y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. For the age group 15-19y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group either above 35y or 10-14y for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) among detected COVID-19 cases in Germany is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, and should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.","Goldstein, E.; Lipsitch, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058719v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058719v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
260,Assessing the risk of spread of COVID-19 to the Asia Pacificregion,"During the early stages of an emerging disease outbreak, governments are required to make critical decisions on how to respond appropriately, despite limited data being available to inform these decisions. Analytical risk assessment is a valuable approach to guide decision-making on travel restrictions and border measures during the early phase of an outbreak, when transmission is primarily contained within a source country. Here we introduce a modular framework for estimating the importation risk of an emerging disease when the direct travel route is restricted and the risk stems from indirect importation via intermediary countries. This was the situation for Australia in February 2020. The framework was specifically developed to assess the importation risk of COVID-19 into Australia during the early stages of the outbreak from late January to mid-February 2020. The dominant importation risk to Australia at the time of analysis was directly from China, as the only country reporting uncontained transmission. However, with travel restrictions from mainland China to Australia imposed from February 1, our framework was designed to consider the importation risk from China into Australia via potential intermediary countries in the Asia Pacific region. The framework was successfully used to contribute to the evidence base for decisions on border measures and case definitions in the Australian context during the early phase of COVID-19 emergence and is adaptable to other contexts for future outbreak response.","Shearer, F.; Walker, J.; Tellioglu, N.; McCaw, J.

261,UV light dosage distribution over irregular respirator surfaces. Methods and implications for safety,"Background and Objectives: The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has lead to a global decrease in protection ware, especially facepiece filtering respirators (FFRs). Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of descontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light dosage varies significantly on different respirator angles, and propose a method to descontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. Methods: An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5 x55 x 33 cm with three 15W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58 x 41 x 15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3M of dimensions 17 x 9 x 4cm, and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR with dimensions 17 x 6 x 5 cm. A spectrometer STN-SilverNova was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. Results: The data obtained reveal that the dosage received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the luminaires plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant in order to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Conclusion: Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance, angle of incidence of the light source. Careful dosage measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.","Baluja, A.; Arines, J.; Vilanova, R.; Bao-Varela, C.; Flores-Arias, M.

262,Assessing the Hospital Surge Capacity of the Kenyan Health System in the Face of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic will test the capacity of health systems worldwide. Health systems will need surge capacity to absorb acute increases in caseload due to the pandemic. We assessed the capacity of the Kenyan health system to absorb surges in the number of people that will need hospitalization and critical care because of the COVID-19. Methods We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. Results The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit. Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19.","Barasa, E.; Ouma, P.

263,"Testing the association between blood type and COVID-19 infection, intubation, and death","The rapid global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has strained existing healthcare and testing resources, making the identification and prioritization of individuals most at-risk a critical challenge. A recent study of patients in China discovered an association between ABO blood type and SARS-CoV-2 infection status by comparing COVID-19 patients with the general population. Whether blood type is associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity or mortality remains unknown. We used observational healthcare data on 1559 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 (682 COV+) with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO+Rh blood type and SARS-CoV-2 infection status, intubation, and death. We found a higher proportion of blood group A and a lower proportion of blood group O among COV+ patients compared to COV-, though in both cases the result is significant only in Rh positive blood types. We show that the effect of blood type is not explained by risk factors we considered (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight status, and chronic cardiovascular and lung disorders). In a meta-analysis of NYP data with previously-reported data from China, we find enrichment for A and B and depletion of O blood groups among COVID-19 patients compared to the general population. Our data do not provide strong evidence of associations between blood group and intubation or death among COVID-19 patients. In this preliminary observational study of data currently being collected during the outbreak, we find new evidence of associations between B, AB, and Rh blood groups and COVID-19 and further evidence of recently-discovered associations between A and O blood groups and COVID-19.","Zietz, M.; Tatonetti, N.

264,Self-collection: an appropriate alternative during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"BACKGROUND Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 are routinely collected by health care workers, putting them at risk of infection and requiring use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Self-collected swabs offer many advantages provided detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is not compromised. METHODS In a prospective study, patients attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs prior to health worker collection (HC). Two different laboratory services participated, with HC at Site 1 collecting nasal and throat swabs and at Site 2 nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs. Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohens kappa ({kappa}). RESULTS Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had COVID-19 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC ({kappa} = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method ({kappa} = 0.959 vs 0.933). CONCLUSIONS Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. High viral load of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the respiratory tract and sensitive molecular methods may explain these findings. Self-collection also provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces the exposure of the community and health workers to those undergoing testing and reduces the requirement for PPE.","Wehrhahn, M.

265,"Factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness among 4,103 patients with COVID-19 disease in New York City","Background: Little is known about factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness in Covid-19 positive patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 treated at a single academic health system in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, with follow up through April 7, 2020. Primary outcomes were hospitalization and critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and/or death). We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and maximum information gain decision tree classifications to identify key splitters. Results: Among 4,103 Covid-19 patients, 1,999 (48.7%) were hospitalized, of whom 981/1,999 (49.1%) have been discharged home, and 292/1,999 (14.6%) have died or were discharged to hospice. Of 445 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 162/445 (36.4%) have died. Strongest hospitalization risks were age [&ge;]75 years (OR 66.8, 95% CI, 44.7-102.6), age 65-74 (OR 10.9, 95% CI, 8.35-14.34), BMI>40 (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure (OR 4.3 95% CI, 1.9-11.2). Strongest critical illness risks were admission oxygen saturation <88% (OR 6.99, 95% CI 4.5-11.0), d-dimer>2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), ferritin >2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), and C-reactive protein (CRP) >200 (OR 5.78, 95% CI, 2.6-13.8). In the decision tree for admission, the most important features were age >65 and obesity; for critical illness, the most important was SpO2<88, followed by procalcitonin >0.5, troponin <0.1 (protective), age >64 and CRP>200. Conclusions: Age and comorbidities are powerful predictors of hospitalization; however, admission oxygen impairment and markers of inflammation are most strongly associated with critical illness.","Petrilli, C.

266,"Applying the unified models of ecology to forecast epidemics, with application to Covid-19","During a burgeoning outbreak of a novel disease, public attention will ordinarily expand as the severity of the outbreak expands--as infections multiply and news reports accumulate. Such public attention will in turn reinforce tactics to control the outbreak. In classical epidemiological models, effects of such tactics can be incorporated in standard parameters of transmission, recovery, and mortality. Unfortunately, early in an outbreak those individual parameters may be poorly known, hence corresponding models can get lost in uncertainty. This makes it difficult to determine whether the disease is spreading exponentially or logistically, or along another path. Examining cases over time is also problematic, as a logistically growing infection that is leveling off appears exponential in early phases. Here we report on the most basic mechanistic, ecological model we can imagine, which can help distinguish growth that is and is not under control. This approach did a satisfactory job predicting the final outcome of the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15. The model's two parameters were computable in real time, well before the outcome was actually known. The first parameter is an intrinsic rate of increase in cumulative deaths or reported cases. The second parameter is related to the human social system and represents all tactics that combine to control the outbreak. That parameter is coupled to the number of cumulative deaths or cases. We examine the basic mechanisms operating in this model and show the predictions made during the Ebola outbreak. We also consider how this basic model is performing for the Covid-19 pandemic and highlight ecological models that align with popularly discussed concepts such as flatten-the-curve, exponential growth, and inflection points of curves.","Loberg, S.

267,Treatment with ACE-inhibitors is associated with less severe disease with SARS-Covid-19 infection in a multi-site UK acute Hospital Trust,"Abstract: Background: The SARS-Cov2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor for cell entry. It has been suggested that ACE-inhibitors, which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and which raise ACE2 levels, may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: We evaluated this hypothesis in an early cohort of 205 acute inpatients with COVID-19 at King's College Hospital and Princess Royal University Hospital, London, UK with the primary endpoint being death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 7-days of symptom onset. Findings: 53 patients out of 205 patients reached the primary endpoint. Contrary to the hypothesis, treatment with ACE-inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of rapidly deteriorating severe disease. There was a lower rate of death or transfer to a critical care unit within 7 days in patients on an ACE-inhibitor OR 0.29 (CI 0.10-0.75, p<0.01), adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease and heart failure). Interpretation: Although a small sample size, we do not see evidence for ACE-inhibitors increasing the short-term severity of COVID-19 disease and patients on treatment with ACE-inhibitors should continue these drugs during their COVID-19 illness. A potential beneficial effect needs to be explored as more data becomes available.","Bean, D.; Kraljevic, Z.; Searle, T.; Bendayan, R.; Pickles, A.; Folarin, A.; Roguski, L.; Noor, K.; Shek, A.; o'gallagher, K.; Zakeri, R.; Shah, A.; Teo, J.; Dobson, R.

268,Modeling the impact of human mobility and travel restrictions on the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan,"Background: As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, understanding how patterns of human mobility and connectivity affect outbreak dynamics, especially before outbreaks establish locally, is critical for informing response efforts. Methods: Here, in collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data with the goals of identifying the high risk areas of disease spread and assessing the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan. We compared the impact of intracity vs. intercity travel restrictions on both the total number of infections and the speed of outbreak spread and developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions. Findings: We found that intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on overall infection numbers than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. We also identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact. Interpretation: In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook's aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. Both intracity and intercity movement affect outbreak dynamics, with the former having more of an impact on the total numbers of cases and the latter impacting geographic scope. These findings have important implications for guiding future policies for travel restrictions during outbreaks in Taiwan.","Chang, M.-C.; Kahn, R.; Li, Y.-A.; Lee, C.-S.; Buckee, C.

Phylogenetic analysis of 84 distinct SARS-CoV2 genomes indicates multiple, independent but isolated introductions mainly from Europe and other parts of the United States.

270,Modeling layered non-pharmaceutical interventions against SARS-CoV-2 in the United States with Corvid,"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe and is poised to cause millions of deaths worldwide. There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments, and vaccines are likely over a year away. At present, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus, but it is not clear how to deploy these potentially expensive and disruptive measures. Modeling can be used to understand the potential effectiveness of NPIs for both suppression and mitigation efforts. Methods and Findings: We developed Corvid, an adaptation of the agent-based influenza model called FluTE to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To demonstrate features of the model relevant for studying the effects of NPIs, we simulated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic population representing a metropolitan area in the United States. Transmission in the model occurs in several settings, including at home, at work, and in schools. We simulated several combinations of NPIs that targeted transmission in these settings, such as school closures and work-from-home policies. We also simulated three strategies for testing and isolating symptomatic cases. For our demonstration parameters, we show that testing followed by home isolation of ascertained cases reduced transmission by a modest amount. We also show how further reductions may follow by isolating cases in safe facilities away from susceptible family members or by quarantining all family members to prevent transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest. Conclusions: Models that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home, work, and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of NPIs, as these are more dependent on community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination. Corvid can be used to help evaluate complex combinations of interventions, although there is no substitute for real-world observations. Our results on NPI effectiveness summarize the behavior of the model for an assumed set of parameters for demonstration purposes. Model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease, both of which are not yet sufficiently characterized for SARS-CoV-2 for quantitative modeling. Models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission will need to be updated as the pathogen becomes better-understood.","Chao, D. L.; Oron, A.

272,"Analysing and comparing the COVID-19 data: The closed cases of Hubei and South Korea, the dark March in Europe, the beginning of the outbreak in South America","The present work is a statistical analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the number of cases worldwide overtakes one million, data reveals closed outbreaks in Hubei and South Korea, with a new slight increase in the number of infected people in the latter. Both of these countries have reached a plateau in the number of Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) residents, suggesting a trend to be followed by other affected regions. Using Hubei's data as a basis of analysis, we have studied the spreading rate of COVID-19 and modelled the epidemic center for 10 European countries. We have also given the final TCCpM curves for Italy and Lombardia. The introduction of the -factor allows us to analyse the different stages of the outbreak, compare the European countries amongst each other, and, finally, to confront the initial phase of the disease between Europe and South America. Methods: By dividing the TCCpM curves in multiple sections spanning short time frames we were able to fit each section to a linear model. By pairing then the angular coefficient ( factor) of each section to the total number of confirmed infections at the center of the corresponding time interval, we have analysed how the spreading rate of Covid-19 changes as more people are infected. Also, by modelling the TCCpM curves with an asymmetrical time integral of a Normal Distribution, we were able to study, by fitting progressively larger data ensembles, how the fitting parameters change as more data becomes available. Findings: The data analysis shows that the spreading rate of COVID-19 increases similarly for all countries in its early stage, but changes as the number of TCCpM in each country grows. Regarding the modelling of the TCCpM curves, we have found that the fitting parameters oscillate with time before reaching constant values. The estimation of such values allows the determination of better parameters for the model, which in turn leads to more trustworthy forecasts on the pandemic development. Interpretation: The analysis of the oscillating fitting parameters allows an early prediction of the TCC, epidemic center and standard deviation of the outbreak. The  factor and the recovered over confirmed cases ratio can be used to understand the pandemic development in each country and to compare the protective measures taken by local authorities and their impact on the spreading of the disease.","De Leo, S.; Maia, G.

273,Association Between BCG Policy is Significantly Confounded by Age and is Unlikely to Alter Infection or Mortality Rates,"Recently a number of publications looked at the association between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on one hand and countries' policies with respect to BCG vaccination on the other. This connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place. In at least 2 preprint publications the authors expressed the view that the ""known immunological benefits"" of BCG vaccination may be behind the biological mechanism of such observation. One study accounted for different income levels in different groups. Another study did not attempted to do so, instead exploring the differences between countries where a booster shot is given vs others where no such practice exists (finding no connection). Both of these studies did not explore other potential confounding factors. Meanwhile the press has focused on these headlines and pushed the narrative that BCG vaccination is causally linked to infection and mortality rates. This poses a serious challenge, demonstrated by the recently initiated clinical trials on BCG vaccination within the COVID19 context. This study shows that population age is a very significant confounding factor that explains the rates of infections much better and has a solid biology mechanism which explains this correlation. It suggests that BCG vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors, such as population age, ethnicity, rates of certain chronic diseases, time from community spread start date, major public policy decisions and income levels.","Kirov, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055616v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055616v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
274,"Covid-19 predictions using a Gauss model, based on data from April 2","We propose a Gauss model (GM), a map from time to the bell-shaped Gauss function to model the casualties per day and country, as a quick and simple model to make predictions on the coronavirus epidemic. Justified by the sigmoidal nature of a pandemic, i.e. initial exponential spread to eventual saturation, we apply the GM to the first corona pandemic wave using data from 25 countries, for which a sufficient amount of not yet fully developed data exists, as of April 2, 2020, and study the model's predictions. We find that logarithmic daily fatalities caused by Covid-19 are well described by a quadratic function in time. By fitting the data to second order polynomials from a statistical $chi^2$-fit with 95% confidence, we are able to obtain the characteristic parameters of the GM, i.e. a width, peak height and time of peak, for each country separately. We provide evidence that this supposedly oversimplifying model might still have predictive power and use it to forecast the further course of the fatalities caused by Covid-19 per country, including peak number of deaths per day, date of peak, and duration within most deaths occur. While our main goal is to present the general idea of the simple modeling process using GMs, we also describe possible estimates for the number of required respiratory machines and the duration left until the number of infected will be significantly reduced.","Schuttler, J.; Schlickeiser, R.; Schlickeiser, F.; Kroger, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055830v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055830v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
275,Effectiveness of quarantine measure on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Hong Kong,"The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. Although quarantine measures have been used widely, the critical steps among them to suppress the outbreak without a huge social-economic loss remain unknown. Hong Kong, unlike other regions in the world, had a massive number of travellers from Mainland China during the early expansion period, and yet the spread of virus has been relatively limited. Understanding the effect of control measures to reduce the transmission in Hong Kong can improve the control of the virus spreading. We have developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model that can stratify the infections into imported and subsequent local infections, and therefore to obtain the control effects on transmissibility in a region with many imported cases. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed cases with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics from Wuhan and Mainland China. The model estimated that the reproductive number was dropped from 2.32 to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86) after an infected case was estimated to be quarantined half day before the symptom onset, corresponding to the incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30-9.47). If the quarantine happened about one day after the onset, community spread would be likely to occur, indicated by the reproductive number larger than one. The results suggest that the early quarantine for a suspected case before the symptom onset is a key factor to suppress COVID-19.","Yuan, H.-Y.; Mao, A.; Han, G.; Yuan, H.; Pfeiffer, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059006v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059006v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True

To date, no prophylactic vaccines or approved therapeutic agents are available for preventing and treating this highly transmittable disease. Here we report two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cloned from memory B cells of patients recently recovered from COVID-19, and both mAbs specifically bind to the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, block the binding of receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and effectively neutralize S protein-pseudotyped virus infection.

278,High-throughput extraction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs using solid-phase reverse immobilization beads,"The ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global surge in laboratory testing for the virus. The gold standard approach to detecting an active viral infection is the use of RT-qPCR. This approach requires the isolation of viral RNA from respiratory specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs. We developed a method using a widely available lysis buffer coupled with solid-phase reverse immobilization (SPRI) beads to extract viral RNA from swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM) which can be performed manually or on a Hamilton STAR liquid-handling robot. Using a WHO recommended, laboratory-developed RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2, we validated this method in a CAP-accredited laboratory, against the IVD-labelled bioMerieux NucliSENS easyMAG automated extraction platform. Our method demonstrates a comparable sensitivity and specificity, making it suitable for large-scale testing and monitoring of suspected COVID-19 cases and healthcare workers. This is especially important as the world faces critical shortages of viral RNA extraction reagents for the existing commercial extraction systems.","Kalikiri, M. K. R.; Hasan, M.

279,To mask or not to mask: Modeling the potential for face mask use by the general public to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic,"Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential of this intervention is not well understood. We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24--65% (and peak deaths 15--69%), compared to 2--9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9--18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.","Eikenberry, S.

280,Multi-route respiratory infection: when a transmission route may dominate,"The exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date. The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behavior, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multi-route transmitted respiratory infection. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines virus content in droplets, exposure distance, and virus dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provides a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the transmission efficiency of different transmission routes of respiratory diseases and provides a basis for predicting the impact of individual level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.","Gao, C.

281,Early Stage Prediction of US County Vulnerability to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Key Points: Question: What are key factors that define the vulnerability of counties in the US to cases of the COVID-19 virus? Findings: In this epidemiological study based on publicly available data, we develop a model that predicts vulnerability to COVID-19 for each US county in terms of likelihood of going from no documented cases to at least one case within five days and in terms of number of occurrences of the virus. Meaning: Predicting county vulnerability to COVID-19 can assist health organizations to better plan for resource and workforce needs. Abstract Importance: The rapid spread of COVID-19 means that government and health services providers have little time to plan and design effective response policies. It is therefore important to rapidly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread. Objective: Developing county level prediction around near future disease movement for COVID-19 occurrences using publicly available data. Design: Original Investigation; Decision Analytical Model Study for County Level COVID-19 occurrences using data from March 14-31, 2020. Setting: Disease spread prediction for US counties. Participants: All US county level granularity based on data fused from multiple publicly available sources inclusive of health statistics, demographics, and geographical features. Exposure(s) (for observational studies): Daily county level reported COVID-19 occurrences from March 14-31, 2020. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We developed a 3-stage model to quantify, firstly the probability of COVID-19 occurrence for unaffected counties using XGBoost classifier and secondly, the number of potential occurrences of a county via XGBoost regression. Thirdly, these results are combined to compute the county level risk. This risk is then used as an estimated after-five-day-vulnerability of the county. Results: Using data from March 14-31, 2020, the model shows a sensitivity over 71.5% and specificity over 94%. Conclusions and Relevance: We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged 70 or greater and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID-19 occurrences. We found a positive association between affected and urban counties as well as less vulnerable and rural counties. The developed model can be used for identification of vulnerable counties and potential data discrepancies. Limited testing facilities and delayed results introduces significant variation in reported cases and produces a bias in the model.

We then apply these probabilities into the actual age-stratified population to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak. Testing with different countries shows the predicted infectious skewing with the country median age and age stratification, as expected. We added a Q parameter to the classic SEIR compartmental model to include the effect of quarantine (Q-SEIR). The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model. As expected, quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both Exposed and Infectious, and to flatten the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment. These two estimates were used as a range to inform planning and response to the COVID-19 threat.","Bongolan, V. P.; Minoza, J. M. A.; de Castro, R.; Sevilleja, J.

Design: Cross sectional study Setting: Sweden Participants: 9,624,428 individuals living in Sweden on 31st December 2014 and alive on 1st January 2016 Main outcome measures: Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on the guidelines from the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which are age 70 years and older, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma, and diabetes. Prognostic factors were identified based on records for three years before 1st January 2016 from the Swedish National Inpatient and Outpatient Specialist Care Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Cancer Register. Results: 22.1% of the study population had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions in the whole study population ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). Conclusions: The prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease will aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the ongoing pandemic. Results can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning. This information is crucial when deciding appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic and reduce both the direct mortality burden from the disease itself, and the indirect mortality burden from potentially overwhelmed health systems.","Gemes, K.; Talback, M.; Modig, K.; Ahlbom, A.; Berglund, A.; Feychting, M.; Matthews, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057919v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057919v1?rss=1,2020-04-11,2020-04-11,,True
284,A stochastic model for COVID-19 spread and the effects of Alert Level 4 in Aotearoa New Zealand,"While case numbers remain low, population-wide control methods combined with efficient tracing, testing, and case isolation, offer the opportunity for New Zealand to contain and eliminate COVID-19. We use a stochastic model to investigate containment and elimination scenarios for COVID-19 in New Zealand, as the country considers the exit from its four week period of strong Level 4 population-wide control measures. In particular we consider how the effectiveness of its case isolation operations influence the outcome of lifting these strong population-wide controls. The model is parameterised for New Zealand and is initialised using current case data, although we do not make use of information concerning the geographic dispersion of cases and the model is not stratified for age or co-morbidities. We find that fast tracing and case isolation (i.e. operations that are sustained at rates comparable to that at the early stages of New Zealand's response) can lead to containment or elimination, as long as strong population-wide controls remain in place. Slow case isolation can lead to containment (but not elimination) as long as strong Level 4 population-wide controls remain in place. However, we find that relaxing strong population-wide controls after four weeks will most likely lead to a further outbreak, although the speed of growth of this outbreak can be reduced by fast case isolation, by tracing, testing, or otherwise. We find that elimination is only likely if case isolation is combined with strong population-wide controls that are maintained for longer than four weeks. Further versions of this model will include an age-structured population as well as considering the effects of geographic dispersion and contact network structure, the possibility of regional containment combined with inter-regional travel restrictions, and the potential for harm to at risk communities and essential workers.","Plank, M.

286,Nitric oxide gas inhalation to prevent COVID-2019 in healthcare providers,"Introduction: In human hosts, SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory syndrome (named COVID-19) which can range from a mild involvement of the upper airways to a severe pneumonia with acute respiratory syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated transmission is an important route of spreading for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and healthcare providers are at the highest risk. As of February 2020, 1716, Chinese healthcare workers had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and at least 6 died. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine or pharmacological prophylaxis to decrease the risk of healthcare providers contracting the infection. Methods and analysis. We will randomize 470 healthcare providers scheduled to work with COVID 19 patients to receive nitric oxide gas administration (NO group, n=235) or no gas administration (control group, n=235). The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of subjects with COVID-19 disease at 14 days from enrollment. Secondary endpoints are the proportion of healthcare providers who present a positive real time RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 14 days after enrollment, the proportion of healthcare providers requiring quarantine, and the total number of quarantine days in the two groups.

287,Characterizing key attributes of the epidemiology of COVID-19 in China: Model-based estimations,"Background: A novel coronavirus strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China in late 2019. The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), soon became a pandemic. This study aims to characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of this infection in China. Methods: An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe the transmission dynamics and estimate the age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to the infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, case fatality rate (CFR), and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R0) following introduction of mass interventions. Results: The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts per day (95% uncertainty interval (UI)=0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years of age, susceptibility to the infection was only 0.06 in those [&le;]19 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in [&ge;]80 years. The assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was very limited at 0.004 (95% UI=0.002-0.008). Final CFR was 5.1% (95% UI=4.8-5.4%). R0 rapidly declined from 2.1 (95% UI=1.8-2.4) to 0.06 (95% UI=0.05-0.07) following onset of interventions. Conclusion: Age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in China. The biological susceptibility to the infection seems limited among children, intermediate among young to mid-age adults, but high among those >50 years of age. There was no evidence for differential contact mixing by age, consistent with most transmission occurring in households rather than in schools or workplaces.","Ayoub, H.

288,"Towards reduction in bias in epidemic curves due to outcome misclassification through Bayesian analysis of time-series of laboratory test results: Case study of COVID-19 in Alberta, Canada and Philadelphia, USA","The aim of our work was to better understand misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 and to study the impact of these errors in epidemic curves. We examined publically available time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, about the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-based diagnostic test. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 3/28/2020) and city of Philadelphia, USA (available on 3/31/2020). Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity (prior and posterior largely overlapped). We applied these insights to uncertainty/bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate. The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves, a task for which the Bayesian method we presented is well-suited.","Burstyn, I.; Goldstein, N.

289,On the interactions of the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with monoclonal antibodies and the receptor ACE2,"A new betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new threat to global health and economy. A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein. By constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, we have mapped the electrostatic epitopes for four monoclonal antibodies and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both SARS-CoV-1 and the new SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins. We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities. However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1. Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022 antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis.","Correa Giron, C.; Laaksonen, A.; Barroso da Silva, F.

290,Rapid in silico design of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 using machine learning and supercomputing,"Rapidly responding to novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, represents an extremely challenging and complex endeavor. Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of -48.1 kcal/mol ({+/-} 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as -82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of -52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning-driven designs. This technical report is a high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies.","Desautels, T.; Zemla, A.; Lau, E.; Franco, M.; Faissol, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024885v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024885v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,False
291,"Homologous protein domains in SARS-CoV-2 and measles, mumps and rubella viruses: preliminary evidence that MMR vaccine might provide protection against COVID-19","The COVID-19 disease is one of worst pandemics to sweep the globe in recent times. It is noteworthy that the disease has its greatest impact on the elderly. Herein, we investigated the potential of childhood vaccination, specifically against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), to identify if this could potentially confer acquired protection over SARS-CoV-2. We identified sequence homology between the fusion proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and measles and mumps viruses. Moreover, we also identified a 29% amino acid sequence homology between the Macro (ADP-ribose-1-phosphatase) domains of SARS-CoV-2 and rubella virus. The rubella Macro domain has surface-exposed conserved residues and is present in the attenuated rubella virus in MMR. Hence, we hypothesize that MMR could protect against poor outcome in COVID-19 infection. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we identified that 1) age groups that most likely lack of MMR vaccine-induced immunity had the poorest outcome in COVID-19, and 2) COVID-19 disease burden correlates with rubella antibody titres, potentially induced by SARS-CoV2 homologous sequences. We therefore propose that vaccination of at risk age groups with an MMR vaccination merits further consideration as a time-appropriate and safe intervention.","Franklin, R.; Young, A.; Neumann, B.; Fernandez, R.; Joannides, A.; Reyahi, A.; Modis, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20053207v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20053207v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True
292,The effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in containing epidemics: a rapid review of the literature and quantitative assessment,"The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has rapidly increased since discovery of the disease in December 2019. In the absence of medical countermeasures to stop the spread of the disease (i.e. vaccines), countries have responded by implementing a suite of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIS) to contain and mitigate COVID-19. Individual NPIs range in intensity (e.g. from lockdown to public health campaigns on personal hygiene), as does their impact on reducing disease transmission. This study uses a rapid review approach and investigates evidence from previous epidemic outbreaks to provide a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of key NPIs used by countries to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from the study are designed to help countries enhance their policy response as well as inform transition strategies by identifying which policies should be relaxed and which should not.","Cheatley, J.; Vuik, S.; Devaux, M.; Scarpetta, S.; Pearson, M.; Colombo, F.; Cecchini, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054197v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054197v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True

294,Evaluation of nine commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays,"Due to urgency and demand, numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoassays are rapidly being developed and placed on the market with limited validation on clinical samples. Thorough validation of serological tests are required to facilitate their use in the accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmation of molecular results, contact tracing, and epidemiological studies. This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of nine commercially available serological tests. These included three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and six point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests. The assays were validated using serum samples from: i) SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients with a documented first day of disease; ii) archived sera obtained from healthy individuals before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China; iii) sera from patients with acute viral respiratory tract infections caused by other coronaviruses or non-coronaviruses; and iv) sera from patients positive for dengue virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. The results showed 100% specificity for the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody ELISA, 93% for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA, and 96% for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA with sensitivities of 90%, 90%, and 65%, respectively. The overall performance of the POC tests according to manufacturer were in the rank order of AutoBio Diagnostics > Dynamiker Biotechnology = CTK Biotech > Artron Laboratories > Acro Biotech [&ge;] Hangzhou Alltest Biotech.

Countries with lower health services and facilities like Pakistan are on great risk. Pakistan so far has 3,277 confirmed cases and 50 reported deaths due to COVID19. Various mathematical models had presented to predict the global and regional size of pandemic. However, all those models have certain limitation due to their dependence on different variables and analyses are subject to potential bias. As each country has its own dimension therefore country specific model are required to develop accurate estimate. Here we present a data model to predict the size of COVID19 in Pakistan.

297,Anticipating the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,"The infectious novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 outbreak has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern, and later as an epidemic. To date, this outbreak has infected more than one million people and killed over fifty thousand people across the world. In most countries, the COVID-19 incidence curve rises sharply in a short span of time, suggesting a transition from a disease free (or low-burden disease) equilibrium state to a sustained infected (or high-burden disease) state. Such a transition from one stable state to another state in a relatively short span of time is often termed as a critical transition. Critical transitions can be, in general, successfully forecasted using many statistical measures such as return rate, variance and lag-1 autocorrelation. Here, we report an empirical test of this forecasting on the COVID-19 data sets for nine countries including India, China and the United States. For most of the data sets, an increase in autocorrelation and a decrease in return rate predict the onset of a critical transition. Our analysis suggests two key features in predicting the COVID-19 incidence curve for a specific country: a) the timing of strict social distancing and/or lockdown interventions implemented, and b) the fraction of a nation's population being affected by COVID-19 at the time of implementation of these interventions. Further, using satellite data of nitrogen dioxide which is emitted predominantly as a result of anthropogenic activities, as an indicator of lockdown policy, we find that in countries where the lockdown was implemented early and strictly have been successful in reducing the extent of transmission of the virus. These results hold important implications for designing effective strategies to control the spread of infectious pandemics.","Kaur, T.; Sarkar, S.; Chowdhury, S.; Sinha, S. K.; Jolly, M.

298,The Immediate Effect of COVID-19 Policies on Social Distancing Behavior in the United States,"In the absence of a vaccine and effective antiviral medications, most of the non-pharmaceutical interventions focus on reducing social contact rates through different social distancing policies. However, the effectiveness of different policies and their relative impact vis-a-vis that of mechanisms driven by public awareness and voluntary actions have not been studied. This is crucial since in most places we observe significant reductions in social interaction before any policy was implemented. Variations in types and effective dates of different social distancing policies across different states in the US create a natural experiment to study the causal impact of each policy during the early stage of the outbreak. Using these policy variations and the aggregate human mobility and location trends published by Google for the month of March 2020, we employ a quasi-experimental approach to measure the impact of six common policies on people's presence at home and their mobility in different types of public places. Our results rank six common social distancing policies based on the magnitude and significance of their impact, beyond what has already been achieved through voluntary actions. They show that while strong policies such as statewide stay home mandate and non-essential business closure have strong causal impacts on reducing social interactions, most of the expected impact of more lenient policies (such as large gathering ban and school closure mandates) are already reaped from non-policy mechanisms such as voluntary actions and public awareness.","Abouk, R.; Heydari, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20057356v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20057356v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True
299,Effects of latency on estimates of the COVID-19 replication number,"It is not currently known how long it takes a person infected by the COVID-19 virus to become infectious. Models of the spread of COVID-19 use very different lengths for this latency period, leading to very different estimates of the replication number R, even when models work from the same underlying data sets. In this paper we quantify how much varying the length of the latency period affects estimates of R, and thus the fraction of the population that is predicted to be infected in the first wave of the pandemic. This variation underscores the uncertainty in our understanding of R and raises the possibility that R may be considerably greater than has been assumed by those shaping public policy.","Sadun, L.

301,"Safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, in light of rapid wide-spread use for COVID-19: a multinational, network cohort and self-controlled case series study","Background: Hydroxychloroquine has recently received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and is currently prescribed in combination with azithromycin for COVID-19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin. Methods: New user cohort studies were conducted including 16 severe adverse events (SAEs). Rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 18+ and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days. Self-controlled case series (SCCS) were conducted to further establish safety in wider populations. Separately, SAEs associated with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (compared to hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (CalHRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where I2<40%. Results: Overall, 956,374 and 310,350 users of hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, and 323,122 and 351,956 users of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine-amoxicillin were included. No excess risk of SAEs was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. SCCS confirmed these findings. However, when azithromycin was added to hydroxychloroquine, we observed an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (CalHR2.19 [1.22-3.94]), chest pain/angina (CalHR 1.15 [95% CI 1.05-1.26]), and heart failure (CalHR 1.22 [95% CI 1.02-1.45]) Conclusions: Short-term hydroxychloroquine treatment is safe, but addition of azithromycin may induce heart failure and cardiovascular mortality, potentially due to synergistic effects on QT length. We call for caution if such combination is to be used in the management of Covid-19.","Lane, J. C. E.; Weaver, J.; Kostka, K.; Duarte-Salles, T.; Abrahao, M. T.

Understanding which cell types are targeted by SARS-CoV-2 virus, whether interspecies differences exist, and how variations in cell state influence viral entry is fundamental for accelerating therapeutic and preventative approaches. In this endeavor, we profiled the transcriptome at single-cell resolution of nine tissues from a Macaca fascicularis monkey. The distribution of SARS-CoV-2 facilitators, ACE2 and TMRPSS2, in different cell subtypes showed substantial heterogeneity across lung, kidney, thyroid and liver. Co-expression analysis identified immunomodulatory proteins such as IDO2 and ANPEP as potential SARS-CoV-2 targets responsible for immune cell exhaustion. Furthermore, single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis of the kidney unveiled a plausible link between IL6-mediated innate immune responses aiming to protect tissue and enhanced ACE2 expression that could promote viral entry. Our work constitutes a unique resource for understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology in two phylogenetically close species, which might guide in the development of effective treatments in humans.

304,Nonmedical Masks in Public for Respiratory Pandemics: Droplet Retention by two-layer Textile Barrier Fully Protects Germ-free Mice from Bacteria in Droplets,"Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, we recently demonstrated that household textiles are effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs) with identical droplet retention potential as medical masks. To further promote the implementation of a universal community droplet reduction solution based on a synchronized encouragement/enforcement of mask utilization by the public based on widely available textiles (mask fabrication without the need for sewing machines), here we conducted a study using germ-free mice to determine to what extent textiles were effective in vivo. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which 100% cotton textile prevented the contamination of germ-free animals on the other side of the textile-barrier (simulating a properly worn mask). Of relevance, all mice protected with textiles remained germ-free after two sprays (inoculation dose: >600 bacterial droplet units per 56.75cm2) compared to the contamination of mice not protected by a textile (0/12 vs 6/6, Fishers exact, p<0.0001). In a second phase of the experiment with 12 germ-free mice exposed again to 10-fold more droplets remained germ-free, while 100% of mice at 180cm became colonized with a single spray (0/8 vs 4/4, Fisher exact, p=0.002). Collectively, barriers protected all mice (even with low-density textiles, heavy vs. light fabric, T-test, p=0.0028) when using textile-EDB to cover the cages (0/20 vs 10/10, Fisher exact, p<0.0001).

305,Human ACE2 receptor polymorphisms predict SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has resulted in a global pandemic. It is a highly contagious positive strand RNA virus and its clinical presentation includes severe to critical respiratory disease that appears to be fatal in [~]3-5% of the cases. The viral spike (S) coat protein engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) cell surface protein to invade the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has acquired mutations that increase its affinity to human ACE2 by [~]10-15-fold compared to SARS-CoV S-protein, making it highly infectious. In this study, we assessed if ACE2 polymorphisms might alter host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by affecting the ACE2 S-protein interaction. Our comprehensive analysis of several large genomic datasets that included over 290,000 samples representing >400 population groups identified multiple ACE2 protein-altering variants, some of which mapped to the S-protein-interacting ACE2 surface. Using recently reported structural data and a recent S-protein-interacting synthetic mutant map of ACE2, we have identified natural ACE2 variants that are predicted to alter the virus-host interaction and thereby potentially alter host susceptibility. In particular, human ACE2 variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, T27A, N64K, T92I, Q102P and H378R are predicted to increase susceptibility. The T92I variant, part of a consensus NxS/T N-glycosylation motif, confirmed the role of N90 glycosylation in immunity from non-human CoVs. Other ACE2 variants K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, E37K, D38V, Y50F, N51S, M62V, K68E, F72V, Y83H, G326E, G352V, D355N, Q388L and D509Y are putative protective variants predicted to show decreased binding to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein.

However, most were not echoed by the patients clinical manifestations, largely due to the lack of protein expression information of ACE2 and co-factors. Here, we incorporated the protein information to analyse the expression of ACE2, together with TMPRSS2 and Furin, two proteases assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection, at single cell level in situ, which we called protein-proofed single-cell RNA (pscRNA) profiling. Systemic analysis across 36 tissues revealed a rank list of candidate cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. The top targets are lung AT2 cells and macrophages, then cardiomyocytes and adrenal gland stromal cells, followed by stromal cells in testis, ovary and thyroid. Whereas, the polarized kidney proximal tubule cells, liver cholangiocytes and intestinal enterocytes are less likely to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 targets as ACE2 localizes at the apical region of cells, where the viruses may not readily reach. These findings are in concert with the clinical characteristics of prominent lung symptoms, frequent heart injury, and uncommon intestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury.

308,Confronting the COVID-19 Pandemic with Systems Biology,"BackgroundThe magnitude and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be overstated. Although the mortality rate is less than SARS and MERS, the global outbreak has already resulted in orders of magnitude more deaths. In order to tackle the complexities of this disease, a Systems Biology approach can provide insights into the biology of the virus and mechanisms of disease.

MethodsUsing a Systems Biology approach, we have integrated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and molecular evolution data layers to understand its impact on host cells. We overlay these analyses with high-resolution structural models and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations conducted on the Summit supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

FindingsTranscriptomic and proteomic data indicate little to no expression of ACE2 in lung tissue. Molecular modeling simulations support ACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, but ACE may also act as a receptor for the virus and may be important for entry of SARS-CoV-1. Gene expression data from bronchoalveolar lavage samples from COVID-19 patients identify upregulation of renin, angiotensin, and the angiotensin 1-7 receptor MAS as well as a cellular landscape consistent with large-scale dissolution of lung parenchyma tissues, likely comprised of all lung epithelial cell types as well as lymphatic endothelial cells, but an absence of cells, such as macrophages, normally essential for host defense.

InterpretationOur analyses indicate that the commonly accepted view that SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via ACE2 expressed in the lung is unlikely because ACE2 is undetectable there. Instead, given the greater target space of ACE2-positive nasal, oral, and gastrointestinal tissues, a more likely scenario suggests initial infection in those tissues is followed by a secondary infection via migration through the lymphatic system and bloodstream to the lung microvasculature. The elimination of macrophages and complete lack of activated cytokine signature in COVID-19 lung samples suggest that a major component of SARS-CoV-2s virulence is its net effect of causing a functional immune deficiency syndrome. Our structural analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome suggests involvement of the highly conserved nsp5 protein as part of a major mechanism that suppresses the nuclear factor transcription factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) pathway, eliminating the host cells interferon-based antiviral response.

Research in context Evidence before this studyWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, NCBI GEO & SRA, PDB, Genotype-Tissue Expression Portal, Proteomics DataBase, ALlele FREquency Database, Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, Human Cell Landscape, Tabula Muris, Google and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, datasets and research reports on all aspects of coronavirus and the genes, gene/protein expression and cell types mentioned in this manuscript up to April 3, 2020.

Added value of this studyBy synthesizing information from a wide variety of data types, sources and scales (from atoms, alleles, transcripts, proteins, protein complexes, cells, tissues, organs and individuals to populations) with a Systems Biology approach we have provided mechanistic insight into the route of infection and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. In addition, this has provided insights into the bodys responses to the virus, including a broader view of the role of the Renin-Angiotensin-System, and the likely targeted tissues and cell types that are responsible for COVID-19 symptoms. We have posited that ACE can be an alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-1 in some tissues and discussed how this may explain the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1. We have also used gene expression levels across organs and individuals to explain some of the possible causes for the different responses observed in individuals across the human population. Furthermore, we have elucidated the effects of COVID-19 on specific cell types in lung tissue. By predicting the structures of the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and doing a thorough structure-based mutational analysis of all SARS-CoV-2 proteins we have been able to provide functional insights as to the likely impacts of these mutations on transmission, virulence and pathogenicity which will serve as a significant resource to the scientific community for further investigation and validation.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study provides greater comprehension of the mechanistic and molecular underpinnings of COVID-19. In so doing it contributes to the understanding of the evolution of the virus and its varying effects on human hosts. This enhanced understanding has implications on disease spread and prevention, provides preliminary evidence for the design of new studies into the causes of susceptibility and severity of illness and provides information that will aid in the development of drugs (targeting viral and human proteins), vaccines, and diagnostic methodologies.","Prates, E.

309,Role of RNA Guanine Quadruplexes in Favoring the Dimerization of SARS Unique Domain in Coronaviruses,"Coronaviruses may produce severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). As a matter of fact, a new SARS-type virus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible of a global pandemic in 2020 with unprecedented sanitary and economic consequences for most countries. In the present contribution we study, by all-atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the interaction between the SARS Unique Domain and RNA guanine quadruplexes, a process involved in eluding the defensive response of the host thus favoring viral infection of human cells. The results obtained evidence two stable binding modes with guanine quadruplexes, driven either by electrostatic (dimeric mode) or by dispersion (monomeric mode) interactions, are proposed being the dimeric mode the preferred one, according to the analysis of the corresponding free energy surfaces. The effect of these binding modes in stabilizing the protein dimer was also assessed, being related to its biological role in assisting SARS viruses to bypass the host protective response. This work also constitutes a first step of the possible rational design of efficient therapeutic agents aiming at perturbing the interaction between SARS Unique Domain and guanine quadruplexes, hence enhancing the host defenses against the virus.

310,A Highly Scalable and Rapidly Deployable RNA Extraction-Free COVID-19 Assay by Quantitative Sanger Sequencing,"There is currently an urgent unmet need to increase coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing capability to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the current shortage in RNA extraction reagents as well as limitations in qPCR protocols have resulted in bottlenecks in testing capacity. Herein, we describe a novel molecular diagnostic for COVID-19 based on Sanger sequencing. This assay uses the addition of a frame-shifted spike-in, a modified PCR master mix, and custom Sanger sequencing data analysis to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a limit of detection comparable to existing qPCR-based assays, at 10-20 genome copy equivalents. Crucially, our assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from viral particles suspended in transport media that was directly added to the PCR master mix, suggesting that RNA extraction can be skipped entirely without any degradation of test performance. Since Sanger sequencing instruments are widespread in clinical laboratories and commonly have built-in liquid handling automation to support up to 3840 samples per instrument per day, the widespread adoption of qSanger COVID-19 diagnostics can unlock more than 1,000,000 tests per day in the US.","Chandler-Brown, D.; Bueno, A.

311,Type 2 and interferon inflammation strongly regulate SARS-CoV-2 related gene expression in the airway epithelium,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes vary from asymptomatic infection to death. This disparity may reflect different airway levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and the spike protein activator, TMPRSS2. Here we explore the role of genetics and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. Importantly, we find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by T2 inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. Finally, we define airway responses to coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections upregulate IL6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cytotoxic immune response relative to other respiratory viruses. Our results reveal mechanisms likely influencing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","Sajuthi, S. P.; DeFord, P.; Jackson, N. D.; Montgomery, M. T.; Everman, J. L.; Rios, C.

312,ACE2 fragment as a decoy for novel SARS-Cov-2 virus,"Novel SARS-Cov-2 enters human cells via interaction between the surface spike (S) glycoprotein and the cellular membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Using a combination of comparative structural analyses of the binding surface of the S protein to ACE2, docking experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations we computationally identified a minimal, stable fragment of ACE2. This fragment binds to the S protein, is soluble, and appears not to bind to the physiological ligand angiotensinII. These results suggest a possible use of the ACE2 fragment as a decoy that could interfere with viral binding by competition.","Renzi, F.; Ghersi, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.028647v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.028647v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,False

A non-parametric and local regression approach to test and compare the growth rate,"Epidemiologists use mathematical models to predict epidemic trends, and these results are inherently uncertain when parameters are unknown or changing. In other contexts, such as climate, modellers use multi-model ensembles to inform their decision-making: when forecasts align, modellers can be more certain. This paper looks at a sub-set of alternative epidemiological models that focus on the growth rate, and it cautions against relying on the method proposed in (Pike & Saini, 2020): relying on the data for China to calculate future trajectories is likely to be subject to overfitting, a common problem in financial and economic modelling. This paper finds, surprisingly, that the data for China are double-exponential, not exponential; and that different countries are showing a range of different trajectories. The paper proposes using non-parametric and local regression methods to support epidemiologists and policymakers in assessing the relative effectiveness of social distancing policies.

315,"Artificial intelligence applied on chest X-ray can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection: a first experience from Lombardy, Italy","Objectives We tested artificial intelligence (AI) to support the diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray (CXR). Diagnostic performance was computed for a system trained on CXRs of Italian subjects from two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Methods We used for training and internal testing an ensemble of ten convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mainly bedside CXRs of 250 COVID-19 and 250 non-COVID-19 subjects from two hospitals. We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as reference standard. Results At 10-fold cross-validation, our AI model classified COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85) and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91). For the independent dataset, AI showed 0.80 sensitivity (95% CI 0.72-0.86) (59/74), 0.81 specificity (29/36) (95% CI 0.73-0.87), and 0.81 AUC (95% CI 0.73-0.87). Radiologists reading obtained 0.63 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.78 specificity (95% CI 0.61-0.90) in one centre and 0.64 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.86 specificity (95% CI 0.71-0.95) in the other. Conclusions This preliminary experience based on ten CNNs trained on a limited training dataset shows an interesting potential of AI for COVID-19 diagnosis.

Analysis of confirmed COVID-19 patients' hospital length of stay in Sichuan can be informative to decision-making in other regions of the world. Design A retrospective cross-sectional study. Data and Method Data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Sichuan Province were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NNDRS) and field survey. We collected information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and the length of hospital stay for confirmed patients. We conducted an exploratory analysis using adjusted multivariate cox-proportional models. Participants A total of 538 confirmed patients of COVID-19 infection in Sichuan Province from January to March 2020. Outcome measure The length of hospital stay after admissions for confirmed patients. Results From January 16, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 538 human cases of COVID-19 infection were laboratory-confirmed, and were hospitalized for treatment. Among these, 271 (50%) were 45 years of age or above, 285 (53%) were male, 450 (84%) were considered as having mild symptoms. The median hospital length of stay was 19 days (interquartile range (IQR): 14-23, Range: 3-41). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that longer hospital length of stay was associated with factors aged 45 and over (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60-0.91), those admitted to provincial hospital (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99), and those with serious illness (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.90); living in areas with more than 5.5 healthcare workers per 1000 population (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65) was associated with shorter hospital length of stay.

317,The Use of Adjuvant Therapy in Preventing Progression to Severe Pneumonia in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multicenter Data Analysis,"ABSTRACT IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic associated with high mortality and effective treatment to prevent clinical deterioration to severe pneumonia has not yet been well clarified. OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of several adjuvant treatments in preventing severe pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 564 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha Public Health Treatment Center, First Hospital of Yueyang, Junshan People's Hospital of Yueyang, Central Hospital of Shaoyang, Central Hospital of Xiangtan, Second Hospital of Changde, Central Hospital of Loudi, and First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China in Hunan province from January 17, 2020 to February 28, 2020; The final date of follow-up was March 15, 2020. EXPOSURES Nonspecific antivirals (arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon ), antihypertensives, and chloroquine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia; Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Of 564 patients, the median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-58 years), and 284 (50.4%) patients were men. Sixty-nine patients (12.2%) developed severe pneumonia. Patients who developed severe pneumonia were older (median age of 59 and 45 years, respectively), and more patients had comorbidities including hypertension (30.4% and 12.3%, respectively), diabetes (17.4% and 6.7%, respectively), and cardiovascular disease (8.7% and 3.2%, respectively) and presented with fever (84.1% and 60.4%, respectively) and shortness of breath (10.1% and 3.8%, respectively) compared with those who did not. Nonspecific antiviral therapy did not prevent clinical progression to severe pneumonia, although fewer hypertensive patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) therapy developed severe pneumonia in contrast with those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive therapy (1 of 16 [6.3%] patients and 16 of 49 [32.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 26.4%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 41.3%]). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension without receiving ACEI/ARB therapy was an independent risk factor (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.00) for developing severe pneumonia irrespective of age. Besides, none of patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia, though without significance (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, -3.5% to 30.0%) by propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hypertensive patients on ACEI or ARB may be protective from severe pneumonia in COVID-19 and hence these therapies should not be ceased unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence. Though none of the current antiviral and immunoregulation therapy showed benefit in preventing COVID-19 progression, chloroquine deserved further investigation.","Feng, Z.; Li, J.; Yao, S.; Yu, Q.; Zhou, W.; Mao, X.; Li, H.; Kang, W.; Ouyang, X.; Mei, J.; Zeng, Q.; Liu, J.; Ma, X.; Rong, P.; Wang, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057539v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057539v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True
318,Variation in False Negative Rate of RT-PCR Based SARS-CoV-2 Tests by Time Since Exposure,"SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR based tests are being used to rule out infection among high-risk individuals such as exposed inpatients and healthcare workers. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset in order to avoid being falsely reassured by negative tests. As such, the goal of our study was to estimate the false negative rate by day since infection. We used previously published data on RT-PCR sensitivity on samples derived from nasal swabs by day since symptom onset (n=633) and fit a cubic polynomial spline to calculate the false negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. Over the four days of infection prior to the typical time of symptom onset (day 5) the probability of a false negative test in an infected individual falls from 100% on day one (95% CI 69-100%) to 61% on day four (95% CI 18-98%), though there is considerable uncertainty in these numbers. On the day of symptom onset, the median false negative rate was 39% (95% CI 16-77%). This decreased to 26% (95% CI 18-34%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset), then began to rise again, from 27% (95% CI 20-34%) on day 9 to 61% (95% CI 54-67%) on day 21. Care must be taken when interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly if performed early in the course of infection, when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If there is high clinical suspicion, patients should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.","Kucirka, L.; Lauer, S.; Laeyendecker, O.; Boon, D.; Lessler, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20051474v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20051474v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True

320,Textile Masks and Surface Covers - A 'Universal Droplet Reduction Model'Against Respiratory Pandemics,"The main form of COVID-19 transmission is via oral-respiratory droplet contamination (droplet; very small drop of liquid) produced when individuals talk, sneeze or cough. In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical droplet precaution to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, given that asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks within the public, can be highly contagious for COVID-19, prevention of environmental droplet contamination (EnDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote public droplet safety, we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal community droplet reduction solution is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 social distancing. All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to <30cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to <10cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a community droplet reduction solution (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks & surface covers) could reduce EnDC and the risk of transmitting or acquiring infectious respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19.","Rodriguez-Palacios, A.; Cominelli, F.; Basson, A.; Pizarro, T.; Ilic, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20045617v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20045617v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True

323,Global access to handwashing: implications for COVID-19 control in low-income countries,"Background: Low-income countries have reduced health care system capacity and are therefore at risk of substantially higher COVID-19 case fatality rates than those currently seen in high-income countries. Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and handwashing access is limited. Objectives: To estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1062 locations from 1990 to 2019. Results: Despite overall improvements from 1990 (34.7% [95% uncertainty interval 32.5-36.7] without access) to 2019 globally, in 2019, 2.01 (1.89-2.13) billion people equal to 26.0% (24.4-27.6) of the global population lacked access to handwashing. More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa were without access to handwashing in 2019, while in eight countries, more than 50 million persons lacked access. Discussion: For populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, while disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries.","Brauer, M.; Zhao, J.

We describe here the clinical course of COVID-19 in a cohort of confirmed cases in Wuhan, China, treated with the repurposed potential experimental therapeutics IFN-2b, arbidol or a combination of IFN-2b plus arbidol. Methods 77 adults with confirmed COVID-19 were treated with either nebulized IFN-2b (5mU,b.i.d.), arbidol (200mg dispersible tablet, t.i.d.) or a combination of IFN-2b plus arbidol. Serial SARS-CoV-2 testing along with hematological measurements, including cell counts and blood biochemistry, serum cytokine levels, temperature and blood oxygen saturation levels were recorded for each patient during their hospital stay. Findings Treatment with IFN-2b with or without arbidol significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and in parallel reduced duration of elevated blood levels for the inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP. Interpretation IFN-2b should be investigated as therapy in COVID-19 cases.","Zhou, Q.; Wei, X.-S.; Xiang, X.; Wang, X.; Wang, Z.-H.; Chen, V.; Shannon, C. P.; Tebbutt, S. J.; Kollmann, T.

325,Spatial Correlation of Particulate Matter Pollution and Death Rate of COVID-19,"The Coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, which was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused 3,314 death as of March 31, 2020 in China. This study aimed to investigate the spatial associations of daily particulate matter (PM) concentrations with death rate of COVID-19 in China. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine the spatial associations of daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations with death rate of COVID-19 in China through multiple linear regression method. We found that COVID-19 held higher death rates with increasing concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 levels in the spatial scale, which may affect the process of patients developed from mild to severe and finally influence the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Yao, Y.; Pan, J.; Wang, W.; Liu, Z.; Kan, H.; Meng, X.; Wang, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20052142v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20052142v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True
326,Real-time detection of COVID-19 epicenters within the United States using a network of smart thermometers,"Containing outbreaks of infectious disease requires rapid identification of transmission hotspots, as the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates. Focusing limited public health resources on transmission hotspots can contain spread, thus reducing morbidity and mortality, but rapid data on community-level disease dynamics is often unavailable. Here, we demonstrate an approach to identify anomalously elevated levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) in real-time, at the scale of US counties. Leveraging data from a geospatial network of thermometers encompassing more than one million users across the US, we identify anomalies by generating accurate, county-specific forecasts of seasonal ILI from a point prior to a potential outbreak and comparing real-time data to these expectations. Anomalies are strongly correlated with COVID-19 case counts and may provide an early-warning system to locate outbreak epicenters.","Chamberlain, S. D.; Singh, I.; Ariza, C. A.; Daitch, A.

327,The respiratory sound features of COVID-19 patients fill gaps between clinical data and screening methods,"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has continuous outbreaks around the world. Lung is the main organ that be involved. There is a lack of clinical data on the respiratory sounds of COVID-19 infected pneumonia, which includes invaluable information concerning physiology and pathology. The medical resources are insufficient, which are now mainly supplied for the severe patients. The development of a convenient and effective screening method for mild or asymptomatic suspicious patients is highly demanded. Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. 10 patients with positive results of nucleic acid were enrolled in this study. Lung auscultation was performed by the same physician on admission using a hand-held portable electronic stethoscope delivered in real time via Bluetooth. The recorded audio was exported, and was analyzed by six physicians. Each physician individually described the abnormal breathing sounds that he heard. The results were analyzed in combination with clinical data. Signal analysis was used to quantitatively describe the most common abnormal respiratory sounds. Results: All patients were found abnormal breath sounds at least by 3 physicians, and one patient by all physicians. Cackles, asymmetrical vocal resonance and indistinguishable murmurs are the most common abnormal breath sounds. One asymptomatic patient was found vocal resonance, and the result was correspondence with radiographic computed tomography. Signal analysis verified the credibility of the above abnormal breath sounds. Conclusions: This study describes respiratory sounds of patients with COVID-19, which fills up for the lack of clinical data and provides a simple screening method for suspected patients.","Huang, Y. h.; Meng, S. j.; Zhang, Y.; Wu, S. s.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, Y. w.; Ye, Y. x.; Wei, Q. f.; Zhao, N. g.; Jiang, J. p.; Ji, X. y.; Zhou, C. x.; Zheng, C.; Zhang, W.; Xie, L. z.; Hu, Y. c.; He, J. q.; Chen, J.; Wang, W. y.; Zhang, C. h.; Cao, L.; Xu, W.; Lei, Y.; Jian, Z. h.; Hu, W. p.; Qin, W. j.; Wang, W. y.; He, Y. l.; Xiao, H.; Zheng, X. f.; Hu, Y.

328,Recent update on COVID-19 in India: Is locking down the country enough?,"Abstract Background: India is the second-largest population in the world, and it is not well equipped, hitherto, in the scenario of the global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 could impart a devastating impact on the Indian population. Only way to respond against this critical condition is by practicing large-scale social distancing. India lock down for 21 days, however, till 7 April 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were growing exponentially, which raises the concerns if the number of reported and actual cases are similar. Methods: We use Lasso Regression with =0.12 and Polynomial features of degree 2 to predict the growth factor. Also, we predicted Logistic curve using the Prophet Python. Further, using the growth rate to logistic, and carrying capacity is 20000 allowed us to calculate the maximum cases and new cases per day. Results: We found the predicted growth factor with a standard deviation of 0.3443 for the upcoming days. When the growth factor becomes 1.0, which is known as Inflection point, it will be safe to state that the rate is no longer exponential. The estimated time to reach the inflection point is between 15-20 April. At that time, the estimated number of total positive cases will be over 12500, if lockdown remains continue. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that there is an urgent need to take action to extend the period of lockdown and allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. Otherwise, the outbreak in India can reach the level of the USA or Italy or could be worse than these countries within a few days or weeks, given the size of the population and lack of resources.","Singh Virk, J.; Ali, S.

329,Clinical analysis and early differential diagnosis of suspected pediatric patients with 2019 novel coronavirus infection,"Abstract Background: Early differential diagnosis of suspected pediatric patients is difficult during the 2019-nCoV epidemic. Objective: To identify clinical characteristics and key points of early differential diagnosis. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on suspected pediatric cases. Results:A total of 77 suspected cases were admitted from Jan 22nd to Mar 1st. Compared with non-2019-nCoV group (n=33),2019-nCoV confirmed group (n=35) had fewer fever (OR[95% CI] 0.39[0.242 to 0.628];P<.001) and symptoms of ARI (0.454[0.287 to 0.719];P<.001),more asymptomatic (15.086[2.117 to 107.475];P<.001), and more family cluster infections (5.469[2.405 to 12.433]; P<.001),while chest CT had more positive findings of viral pneumonia (1.813[1.131 to 2.908];P=.014).There were significant statistical differences between the two groups in age (7.2[3.9 to 11.4] vs 5[2.1 to 7.8];P=.031),body temperature (36.7[36.2 to 36.9] vs 37[36.7 to 37.9];P=.001), heart rate ([97.1 and 16.8] vs [109.7 and 15.6];P=.002),percentage ([39.4 and 14.9] vs [52.5 and 17.5]; P=.001) and count (2.25[1.43 to 3.53] vs 3.33[2.8 to 5.18];P=.007) of neutrophil, percentage (45.3[39.2 to 56.6] vs 33.2[22.7 to 42.5];P=.001) of lymphocyte,hs-CRP (5.52[1.1 to 9.04] vs 9.04[7.35 to 9.54];P=.002) and PCT (0.05[0.03 to 0.08] vs 0.1[0.05 to 0.21];P<.001),while gender (42.9% vs 57.6%;P=.332),respiratory rate (22[20 to 22] vs 22[20 to 24];P=.092),WBC (5.37[4.67 to 8.08] vs 6.94[5.72 to 8.87];P=.198), lymphocyte count (2.68[1.99 to 4.01] vs 2.26[1.66 to 2.92];P=.096),Hb (128[124 to 142] vs 130[119 to 137];P=.572) and PLT ([279.1 and 77.5] vs [263.4 and 65.1];P=.37) were statistically insignificant. Conclusions: Asymptoms or mild symptoms,positive CT findings and family cluster infection are the main clinical characteristics of infected pediatric patients. The CBC, hs-CRP and PCT can provide an important basis for early differential diagnosis. Compared with other non-bacterial infections,hs-CRP and PCT in 2019-nCoV infection are reduced,but further evidence is needed to support whether their reduction is specific.

331,A simple method to quantify country-specific effects of COVID-19 containment measures,"Most of the world is currently fighting to limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy, the Western country with most COVID-19 related deaths, was the first to implement drastic containment measures in early March, 2020. Since then most other European countries, the USA, Canada and Australia, have implemented similar restrictions, ranging from school closures, banning of recreational activities and large events, to complete lockdown. Such limitations, and softer promotion of social distancing, may be more effective in one society than in another due to cultural or political differences. It is therefore important to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives by analyzing country-specific COVID-19 data. We propose to model COVID-19 dynamics with a SIQR (susceptible - infectious - quarantined - recovered) model, since confirmed positive cases are isolated and do not transmit the disease. We provide an explicit formula that is easily implemented and permits us to fit official COVID-19 data in a series of Western countries. We found excellent agreement with data-driven estimation of the day-of-change in disease dynamics and the dates when official interventions were introduced. Our analysis predicts that for most countries only the more drastic restrictions have reduced virus spreading. Further, we predict that the number of unidentified COVID-19-positive individuals at the beginning of the epidemic is [~]10 times the number of confirmed cases. Our results provide important insight for future planning of non-pharmacological interventions aiming to contain spreading of COVID-19 and similar diseases.","Pedersen, M.

332,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) envelope (E) protein harbors a conserved BH3-like motif,"Following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged at the end of 2019 as a highly pathogenic infectious agent that rapidly spread around the world. SARS-CoV-2 shares high sequence homology with SARS-CoV and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV. Like other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 encode four major structural proteins: Spike (S), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N) and Envelope (E). SARS-CoV E protein is abundant in infected cells and plays a crucial role in viral particle assembly. Moreover, SARS coronaviruses lacking E are attenuated in vivo, suggesting that CoV E may act as a critical virulence factor not only in SARS-CoV but also in the case of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Ectopic expression of SARS-CoV E was previously shown to trigger apoptosis (cell suicide) of T lymphocytes, lymphopenia being a common feature observed in fatal cases following viral infections. Importantly, T-cell apoptosis was shown to involve interaction between the C-terminal region of SARS-CoV E and the Bcl-2 family member Bcl-xL, which acts as a potent anti-apoptotic protein. Here we provide the first observation that the SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E proteins share a conserved Bcl-2 Homology 3 (BH3)-like motif in their C-terminal region, a well-studied motif shown to be necessary for SARS-CoV E binding to Bcl-xL. We used available sequence data for SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses, in combination with structural information, to study the structure to biological activity relationships of SARS-CoV-2 E in relation with its BH3-like motif. Our analysis of the SARS-CoV E interactome further revealed that the predicted SARS-CoV-2 network is extensively wired to the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch. Research is therefore needed to establish if SARS-CoV-2 E targets prosurvival Bcl-2 homologs to modulate cell viability, as part of a coronavirus strategy to interfere with apoptosis. The identification of small molecules (or the repurposing of existing drugs) able to disrupt SARS-CoV-2 E BH3-mediated interactions might provide a targeted therapeutic approach for COVID-19 treatment. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 expressing an E protein with a deleted or mutated BH3-like motif might also be of interest for the design of a live, attenuated vaccine.","Navratil, V.; Lionnard, L.; Longhi, S.; Combet, C.; Aouacheria, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.033522v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.033522v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,False

The present study followed computational approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 by its interactions with the human leukocyte antigen alleles. We identified twenty-four peptide stretches on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are well conserved among the reported strains. The S protein structure further validated the presence of predicted peptides on the surface. Out of which twenty are surface exposed and predicted to have reasonable epitope binding efficiency.

334,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): an observational cohort study in primary and secondary prevention of pneumonia in an at-risk population,"Background. Recent studies suggest that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could be effective against COVID-19. It is reasonable to expect that if HCQ can prevent or reduce the adverse effects of influenza, it may also reduce the effects of COVID-19 in humans. The objective of this study was to test whether HCQ can prevent or reduce the risk and severity of influenza. Methods. This is an observational cohort study using medico-administrative data from Quebec. Patients included had at least one emergency department (ED) visit in 2012 or 2013, with a prior diagnosis of chronic conditions, and were admissible to the public drug insurance plan. Two sub-cohorts were considered depending on reasons for ED visit: other than influenza or pneumonia (primary prevention) and influenza or pneumonia (secondary prevention). Results. In the primary prevention analysis (n=417,353), patients taking HCQ (n=3,659) had an increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia in the following year compared to those who did not (5.2% vs. 2.9%; adjusted OR=1.25, p=0.0079). In the secondary prevention analysis (n=27,152), patients taking HCQ (n=392), compared to those who did not had a modest and non-significant increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia after 30 days (25.8% vs. 22.6%; adjusted OR=1.14, p=0.3177). Interpretation: Based on the assumption that HCQ has similar effects on the COVID-19 as those observed on influenza, we can infer that it will not have positive effects on COVID-19. We should therefore act cautiously before initiating prospective interventional studies on the use of HCQ to reduce adverse effects of COVID-19.","Vanasse, A.; Courteau, J.; Chiu, Y.; Cantin, A.; Leduc, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057893v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057893v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True

336,COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0,"Introduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives.","Dropkin, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20052340v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20052340v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True
337,Spatial modeling cannot currently differentiate SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and human distributions on the basis of climate in the United States,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is wreaking havoc globally, yet knowledge of its biology is limited. Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest a link between SARS-CoV-2 and cool weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in a population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, climate still may be important for predicting the future distribution of SARS-CoV-2. To further examine if there is a link, we model with raw cases and population scaled cases for SARS-CoV-2 county-level data from the United States. We show that SDMs built from population scaled cases data cannot be distinguished from control models built from raw human population data, while SDMs built on raw data fail to predict the current known distribution of cases in the US. The population scaled analyses indicate that climate may not play a central role in current US viral distribution and that human population density is likely a primary driver. Still, we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas. This coupled with our geographically constrained focus make it so we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the US SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate's role on SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 can spread anywhere in the US.","Harbert, R. S.; Cunningham, S.

The results suggest two plausible hypotheses - either the COVID-19 pandemic is still at very early stages of progression in South Africa or a combination of prompt mitigating measures, demographics and social factors have resulted in a slowdown in its spread and severity. We further propose pandemic monitoring and health system capacity metrics for assisting decision-makers in evaluating which of the two hypotheses is most probable.","Mbuvha, R.

339,Protocol for a multicentre study of nosocomial SARS-CoV2 transmission The NOSO-COR Project,"Introduction: The newly identified SARS-CoV2 can cause serious acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia with a mortality rate of approximately 2% to 4%. In the current context of high incidence rates of SARS-CoV2 in the community, a significant increase in the rate of nosocomial transmission is expected. The risk of nosocomial transmission could even be higher in low-income countries that have fragile healthcare systems. This protocol is intended to study and document suspected or confirmed cases of nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infection, the clinical spectrum and the determinants (risk factors/protective) at participating hospitals. Methods and analysis: This will be an international multicentre prospective, observational, hospital-based study in adults and children. It will include volunteer patients, care givers and healthcare professionals in France and hospitals affiliated with the GABRIEL network. Demographic and clinical data will be collected using case-report forms designed especially for the purpose of the project. A nasopharyngeal swab will be collected and tested for SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR. Characteristics of the study participants, the proportion of confirmed nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infections relative to all patients with syndromes suggestive of 2019-nCoV infection will be analysed. Appropriate multivariate modelling will be used to identify the determinants associated with nosocomial onset. Ethics and dissemination: This study was approved by the clinical research and committee of Ile de France V on March 8, 2020. Registration details: The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials (NCT04290780).","Saadatian-Elahi, M.; Picot-Sanchez, V.; Henaff, L.; Pradel, F.; Escuret, V.; Dananche, C.; Elias, C.; Endtz, H.; Vanhems, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057471v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057471v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True
340,Robust Estimation of Infection Fatality Rates during the Early Phase of a Pandemic,"During a pandemic, robust estimation of case fatality rates (CFRs) is essential to plan and control suppression and mitigation strategies. At present, estimates for the CFR of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection vary considerably. Expert consensus of 0.1-1% covers in practical terms a range from normal seasonable Influenza to Spanish Influenza. In the following, I deduce a formula for an adjusted Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) to assess mortality in a period following a positive test adjusted for selection bias. Official datasets on cases and deaths were combined with data sets on number of tests. After data curation and quality control, a total of IFR (n=819) was calculated for 21 countries for periods of up to 26 days between registration of a case and death. Estimates for IRFs increased with length of period, but levelled off at >9days with a median for all 21 countries of 0.11 (95%-CI: 0.073-0.15). An epidemiologically derived IFR of 0.040 % (95%-CI: 0.029%-0.055%) was determined for Iceland and was very close to the calculated IFR of 0.057% (95%-CI: 0.042-0.078), but 2.7-6-fold lower than CFRs. IFRs, but not CFRs, were positively associated with increased proportions of elderly in age-cohorts (n=21, spearman's {rho} =.73, p =.02). Real-time data on molecular and serological testing may further displace classical diagnosis of disease and its related death. I will critically discuss, why, how and under which conditions the IFR, provides a more solid early estimate of the global burden of a pandemic than the CFR.","Simon, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057729v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057729v1?rss=1,2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,True
341,BioLaboro: A bioinformatics system for detecting molecular assay signature erosion and designing new assays in response to emerging and reemerging pathogens,"BackgroundEmerging and reemerging infectious diseases such as the novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19 and Ebola pose a significant threat to global society and test the public health communitys preparedness to rapidly respond to an outbreak with effective diagnostics and therapeutics. Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned or newly designed assays.

ResultsHere we describe a bioinformatics system named BioLaboro to identify signature regions in a given pathogen genome, design PCR assays targeting those regions, and then test the PCR assays in silico to determine their sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate BioLaboro with two use cases: Bombali Ebolavirus (BOMV) and the novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). For the BOMV, we analyzed 30 currently available real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays against the three available complete genome sequences of BOMV. Only two met our in silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer/probe sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence. Four assays are closely clustered in the nucleoprotein gene and one is located in the glycoprotein gene. Similarly, for the SARS-CoV-2, we designed five highly specific primer sets that hit all 145 whole genomes (available as of February 28, 2020) and none of the near neighbors.

ConclusionsHere we applied BioLaboro in two real-world use cases to demonstrate its capability; 1) to identify signature regions, 2) to assess the efficacy of existing PCR assays to detect pathogens as they evolve over time, and 3) to design new assays with perfect in silico detection accuracy, all within hours, for further development and deployment. BioLaboro is designed with a user-friendly graphical user interface for biologists with limited bioinformatics experience.","Holland, M.; Negron, D.; Mitchell, S.; Dellinger, N.; Ivancich, M.; Barrus, T.; Thomas, S.; Jennings, K.

342,Room-temperature-storable PCR Mixes for SARS-CoV-2 Detection,"A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, causing an outbreak of pneumonia [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in Wuhan, China, which then rapidly spread globally. Although the use of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges to already overburdened logistics networks. Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with [~]1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (18[~]25{degrees}C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37{degrees}C and 56{degrees}C, respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and hospital laboratories. This method can also be applied to the generation of freeze-dried PCR mixes for the detection of other pathogens.","Xu, J.; Wang, J.; Zhong, Z.; Su, X.; Yang, K.; Chen, Z.; Zhang, D.; Li, T.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, S.; Ge, S.; Zhang, J.; Xia, N.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.029934v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.029934v1?rss=1,2020-04-09,2020-04-09,,False

We predicted therapeutic candidates that could reverse the gene expression of coronavirus-infected host cells. Thirteen expression signatures computed from various experimental conditions and preclinical models could be reversed by those compounds known to be effective against SARS- or MERS-CoV, as well as the drug candidates recently shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. We selected ten novel candidates to further evaluate their in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Four compounds bortezomib, dactolisib, alvocidib and methotrexate inhibited the formation of virus infection-induced cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells at 1 {micro}M, yet such a concentration seems toxic to the cells as well. While the evaluation in other permissive cells and the prediction of toxicity are needed to optimize and minimize their antiviral activity and cytotoxicity, respectively, this computational approach has the potential to rapidly and rationally identify drug candidates against COVID-19.","Xing, J.; Shankar, R.; Drelich, A.; Paithankar, S.; Chekalin, E.; Dexheimer, T.; Rajasekaran, S.; Tseng, C.-T.

344,The aging transcriptome and cellular landscape of the human lung in relation to SARS-CoV-2,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, age-associated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.","Chow, R.

345,Decoding the lethal effect of SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) strains from global perspective: molecular pathogenesis and evolutionary divergence,"BackgroundCOVID-19 is a disease with global public health emergency that have shook the world since its first detection in China in December, 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible behind this pandemic. The lethality of different viral strains is found to vary in different geographical locations but the molecular mechanism is yet to be known.

MethodsAvailable data of whole genome sequencing of different viral strains published by different countries were retrieved and then analysed using Multiple Sequence Alignment and Pair-wise Sequence Alignment leading to Phylogenetic tree construction. Each location and the corresponding genetic variations were screened in depth. Then the variations are analysed at protein level giving special emphasis on Non Synonymous amino acid substitutions. The fatality rates in different countries were matched against the mutation number, rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the Non Synonymous changes at protein level, separately and in combination.

FindingsAll the viral strains have been found to evolve from the viral strain of Taiwan (MT192759) which is 100% identical with the ancestor SARS-CoV-2 sequences of Wuhan (NC 045512.2; submitted on 5th Jan, 2020). Transition from C to T (C>T) is the most frequent mutation in this viral genome and mutations A>T, G>A, T>A are the rarest ones, found in countries with maximum fatality rate i.e Italy, Spain and Sweden. 20 Non Synonymous mutations are located in viral genome spanning Orf1ab polyprotein, Surface glycoprotein, Nucleocapsid protein etc. The functional effect on the structure and function of the protein can favourably or unfavourably interact with the host body.

InterpretationThe fatality outcome depends on three important factors (a) number of mutation (b) rarity of the allelic variation and (c) functional consequence of the mutation at protein level. The molecular divergence, evolved from the ancestral strain (S) lead to extremely lethal (E), lethal(L) and non lethal (N) strains with the involvement of an Intermediate strain(I).","Banerjee, S.; Dhar, S.; Bhattacharjee, S.; Bhattacharjee, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.027854v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.027854v1?rss=1,2020-04-09,2020-04-09,,False

Approximately 14% of patients with COVID-19 experienced severe disease and 5% were critically ill2. Studies have shown that dysregulation of the COVID-19 patients immune system may lead to inflammatory storm and cause severe illness and even death3,4. Tocilizumab treatment targeting interleukin 6 receptor has shown inspiring clinical results of severe COVID-19 patients5. However, the immune network with Tocilizumab treatment at single cell resolution has not been uncovered. Here, we profiled the single-cell transcriptomes of 13,289 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated at three longitudinal stages from two severe COVID-19 patients treated with Tocilizumab. We identified a severe stage-specific monocyte subpopulation and these cells centric immune cell interaction network connected by the inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. The over-activated inflammatory immune response was attenuated after Tocilizumab treatment, yet immune cells including plasma B cells and CD8+ T cells still exhibited an intense humoral and cell-mediated anti-virus immune response in recovered COVID-19 patients.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S identified from memory B cells of a SARS survivor infected in 2003. One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants.

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected over one million people worldwide as of April, 2020, and has led to the deaths of nearly 300,000 people. No approved vaccines or treatments in the USA currently exist for COVID-19, so there is an urgent need to develop effective countermeasures. The IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) is an investigational antiviral drug that acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH. It has been demonstrated to suppress replication of a variety of emerging RNA viruses. We report here that MMPD suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. After overnight pretreatment of Vero cells with 10 M of MMPD, viral titers were reduced by 4 logs of magnitude, while pretreatment for 4 hours resulted in a 3-log drop. The effect is dose-dependent, and concentrations as low as 3.3 M significantly reduced viral titers when the cells were pretreated prior to infection.

352,Gene expression and in situ protein profiling of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in human airway epithelial cells and lung tissue,"In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.

To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.

We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.

Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.","Aguiar, J.

353,JAK1 inhibition blocks lethal sterile immune responses:implications for COVID-19 therapy,"Cytokine storms are drivers of pathology and mortality in myriad viral infections affecting the human population. In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.

354,Characterizing geographical and temporal dynamics of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using informative subtype markers,"Genetic subtyping of viruses and bacteria is a critical tool for visualizing and modeling their geographic distribution and temporal dynamics. Quantifying viral dynamics is of particular importance for the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Effective containment strategies and potential future therapeutic and vaccine strategies will likely require a precise and quantitative understanding of viral transmission and evolution. In this paper, we employ an entropy-based analysis to identify mutational signatures of SARS-CoV-2 strains in the GISAID database available as of April 5, 2020. Our analysis method identifies nucleotide sites within the viral genome which are highly informative of variation between the viral genomes sequenced in different individuals. These sites are used to characterize individual virus sequence with a characteristic Informative Subtype Marker (ISM). The ISMs provide signatures that can be efficiently and rapidly utilized to quantitatively trace viral dynamics through geography and time. We show that by analyzing the ISM of currently available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we are able to profile international and interregional differences in viral subtype, and visualize the emergence of viral subtypes in different countries over time. To validate and demonstrate the utility of ISM-based subtyping: (1) We show the distinct genetic subtypes of European infections, in which early on infections are related to the viral subtypes that has become dominant in Italy followed by the development of local subtypes, (2) We distinguish subtypes associated with outbreaks in distinct parts of the United States, identify the development of a local subtype potentially due to community to transmission and distinguish it from the predominant subtype in New York, suggesting that the outbreak in New York is linked to imported cases from Europe. (3) We present results that quantitatively show the temporal behavior of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from localization in China to a pattern of distinct regional subtypes as the virus spreads throughout the world over time. Accordingly, we show that genetic subtyping using entropy-based ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as the Nextstrain [9] project, in efficiently quantifying SARS-CoV-2 dynamics to enable modeling, data-mining, and machine learning tools. Following from this initial study, we have developed a pipeline to dynamically generate ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and generate updated visualization of geographical and temporal dynamics, and made it available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM.","Zhao, Z.; Sokhansanj, B.

355,The spatial and cell-type distribution of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in human and mouse brain,"By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may invade host cells in many organs, including the brain. However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some important brain areas, such as the substantia nigra and brain ventricles. According to our cell-type distribution analysis, the expression of ACE2 were found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, but the ACE2-expressing cells was none in the prefrontal cortex and very few in the hippocampus. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brain, which indicates the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable to result in serious central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.","Chen, R.; Yu, J.; Wang, K.; Chen, Z.; Wen, C.; Xu, Z.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030650v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030650v1?rss=1,2020-04-09,2020-04-09,,False
356,Vulnerabilities of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to proteotoxicity -- opportunity for repurposed chemotherapy of COVID-19 infection,"There is an urgent requirement for improved treatments of COVID-19 disease. A strategy for chemotherapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites - such as reactive oxygen species and arginine-directed glycating agent, methylglyoxal - for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2. Sequence analysis of functional domains in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome showed 0.8-fold depletion of cysteine residues and 4.9-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting methylglyoxal modification may inactivate the virus. We discovered the peptide motif for MG modification: 3 - 5-fold enrichment of cationic residues preceding the target arginine. There was 5-fold enrichment of methylglyoxal modification sites in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, compared to the human host - indicating selective toxicity of methylglyoxal to the virus. We found antitumor drugs, doxorubicin and paclitaxel, increase cellular methylglyoxal to virucidal levels. Taken together, these findings reveal a proteomic vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to methylglyoxal modification and provide a rationale for repurposing doxorubicin and paclitaxel for COVID-19 treatment.","Al-Motawa, M.; Abbas, H.; Wijten, P.; de la Fuente, A.; Xue, M.; Rabbani, N.; Thornalley, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.029488v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.029488v1?rss=1,2020-04-09,2020-04-09,,False

We investigate SARS-CoV-2 genome responsible of the new deadly COVID-19 pandemic for the theoretical possibilities to engage intra pairing within the viral RNA and also hybrid pairing with human transcriptome. Segmental pieces of RNAs that originate from SARS-CoV-2 were computationally searched as a potential source of one strand, the complementary strand being from the host transcriptome. We therefore considered perfect complementarity of host RNA with any piece of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as a collection of theoretical siRNAs potentially Dicer substrates.

358,Prediction of SARS-CoV interaction with host proteins during lung aging reveals a potential role for TRIB3 in COVID-19.,"COVID-19 is prevalent in the elderly. Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus (HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication, we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses. We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) during aging in male individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease.","de Moraes, D.; Paiva, B. V. B.; Cury, S. S.; Araujo, J. P.; Mori, M. A. d. S.; Carvalho, R.

359,"Structural basis for the inhibition of COVID-19 virus main protease by carmofur, an antineoplastic drug","COVID-19 virus is the cause of a debilitating and life-threatening infectious pulmonary disease that is now responsible for a global pandemic. Currently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines to contain this virus. The main protease (Mpro) of COVID-19 virus is a key enzyme, which plays an essential role in viral replication and transcription, making it an ideal drug target. An FDA-approved antineoplastic drug, carmofur, has been identified as an inhibitor that targets COVID-19 virus Mpro. However, its inhibitory mechanism is unknown. Here, we report the 1.6-[A] crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with carmofur. The crystal structure shows that carmofur contains an electrophilic carbonyl reactive group, which covalently binds to C145, a member of the catalytic dyad. As a result, its fatty acid tail occupies the hydrophobic S2 subsite of Mpro whilst its 5-fluorouracil head is cleaved as product of the new covalent bond that has formed. Carmofur is active in a cell based antiviral assay with an EC50 of 24.87 M. It is therefore a promising lead compound for the development of new antivirals to target COVID-19.","Jin, Z.; Zhao, Y.; Sun, Y.; Zhang, B.; Wang, H.; Wu, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Zhu, C.; Hu, T.; Du, X.; Duan, Y.; Yu, J.; Yang, X.; Yang, X.; Liu, X.; Guddat, L.

363,Social distancing to slow the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic: an interrupted time-series analysis,"Background: Social distancing measures to address the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic may have significant health, social, and economic impacts. Objective: To estimate the mean change in state-level COVID-19 epidemic growth before versus after the implementation of statewide social distancing measures. Design: Interrupted time-series analysis. Setting: United States. Measurements: Our primary exposure was time in relation to implementation of the first statewide social distancing measure. The pre-implementation period began 14 days prior to implementation and included up to 3 days after implementation to account for incubation. Post-implementation began 4 days after, up to and including March 30. Our primary outcome was the COVID-19 growth rate, calculated as the log of daily COVID-19 cases minus the log of daily COVID-19 cases on the prior day. Results: All states applied some form of statewide social distancing between March 10-27. The mean daily COVID-19 growth rate decreased beginning four days after implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures, by an additional 0.8% per day; 95% CI, -1.4% to -0.2%; P=0.002). This reduction corresponds to an increase in doubling time of the epidemic from 3.3 days (before) to 5.0 days (at 14 days after implementation). Limitations: Potential bias due to the aggregate nature of the ecological data, potential confounding by contemporaneous changes (e.g., increases in testing), and potential underestimation of social distancing due to spillovers across neighboring states. Conclusion: Statewide social distancing measures were associated with a decrease in U.S. COVID-19 epidemic growth. Based on the size of the epidemic at the time of implementation in each state, social distancing measures were associated with a decrease of 3,090 cases at 7 days, and 68,255 cases at 14 days, after implementation.","Siedner, M.

Methods: The R0 of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The serial interval was fit with a gamma distribution. The probable incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using earlyR and projections packages in R software. Results: The maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) by the end of the day 41. The expected average number of new cases in Shahroud is 9.0 case/day with a standard deviation of 3.8, which means an estimated total of 271 (95% CI: 178-383) new cases in the next 30 days. Conclusions: It is essential to reduce the R0 to values below one.

ELIGIBLE DATA: Countries and US states or major cities with at least 250 COVID-19 deaths as of 4/4/2020 and with information available on death counts according to age strata, allowing to calculate the number of deaths in people with age <65. Data were available for Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, as well as Louisiana, Michigan, Washington states and New York City as of April 4, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of COVID-19 deaths that occur in people <65 years old; relative risk of COVID-19 death in people <65 versus [&ge;]65 years old; absolute risk of death in people <65 and in those [&ge;]80 years old in the general population as of 4/4/2020; absolute death risk expressed as equivalent of death risk from driving a motor vehicle. RESULTS: Individuals with age <65 account for 5%-9% of all COVID-19 deaths in the 8 European epicenters, and approach 30% in three US hotbed locations. People <65 years old had 34- to 73-fold lower risk than those [&ge;]65 years old in the European countries and 13- to 15-fold lower risk in New York City, Louisiana and Michigan. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death ranged from 1.7 per million for people <65 years old in Germany to 79 per million in New York City. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death for people [&ge;]80 years old ranged from approximately 1 in 6,000 in Germany to 1 in 420 in Spain. The COVID-19 death risk in people <65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the death risk from driving between 9 miles per day (Germany) and 415 miles per day (New York City). People <65 years old and not having any underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.3%, 0.7%, and 1.8% of all COVID-19 deaths in Netherlands, Italy, and New York City. CONCLUSIONS: People <65 years old have very small risks of COVID-19 death even in the hotbeds of the pandemic and deaths for people <65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon.

This study assessed the predictors and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) among individuals with COVID-19. Methods: This observational study, included data on all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 5 to March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was censored on March 8, 2020. This is a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Patients clinically confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 5 to March 8, 2020 were enrolled. We evaluated the association between changes in the incidence of AKI and COVID-19 disease and clinical outcomes by using logistic regression models. Results: A total of 287 patients, 55 with AKI and 232 without AKI, were included in the analysis. Compared to patients without AKI, AKI patients were older, predominantly male, and were more likely to present with hypoxia and have pre-existing hypertension and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, AKI patients had higher levels of white blood cells, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, a higher prevalence of hyperkalemia, lower lymphocyte counts, and higher chest computed tomographic scores. The incidence of stage 1 AKI was 14.3%, and the incidence of stage 2 or 3 AKI was 4.9%. Patients with AKI had substantially higher mortality. Conclusions: AKI is an important complication of COVID-19. Older age, male, multiple pre-existing comorbidities, lymphopenia, increased infection indicators, elevated D-dimer, and impaired heart and liver functions were the risk factors of AKI. AKI patients who progressed to stages 2 or 3 AKI had a higher mortality rate.

The pandemic curve has been explored for above average affected countries, six regions and global scale during 64 days of 22nd January to 24th March, 2020. The global cases infection as well as recovery rate curves remained in the ranged of 0 - 9.89 and 0 - 8.89%, respectively. The confirmed cases probability density curve is high positive skewed and leptokurtic with mean global infected daily population of 6620. The recovered cases showed bimodal positive skewed curve of leptokurtic type with daily recovery of 1708. The change point detection helped to understand the CoVID-19 curve in term of sudden change in term of mean or mean with variance. This pointed out disease curve is consist of three phases and last segment that varies in term of day lengths. The mean with variance based change detection is better in differentiating phases and associated segment length as compared to mean. Global infected population might rise in the range of 0.750 to 4.680 million by 24th April 2020, depending upon the pandemic curve progress beyond 24th March, 2020. Expected most affected countries will be USA, Italy, China, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Iran and UK with at least infected population of over 0.100 million. Infected population polynomial projection errors remained in the range of -78.8 to 49.0%.","Akhtar, I. u.

372,Derivation of the effective reproduction number R for COVID-19 in relation to mobility restrictions and confinement,"The spread of COVID-19 is posing an unprecedented threat to health systems worldwide[1]. The fast propagation of the disease combined with the existence of covert contagions by asymptomatic individuals make the controlling of this disease particularly challenging. The key parameter to track the progression of the epidemics is the effective reproduction number R, defined as the number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual[2]. The suppression of the epidemics is directly related to this value, and is attained when R<1.Here, we find an analytical expression for R as a function of mobility restrictions and confinement measures, using an epidemic model tailored for COVID-19. This expression for R is an extremely useful tool to design containment policies that are able to suppress the epidemics. We applied our epidemic model for the case of Spain, successfully forecasting both the observed incidence in each region and the overload of the health system. The expression for R allowed us to determine the precise reduction of mobility kappa_0 needed to bend the curve of epidemic incidence, which turned out to be kappa_0 {approx} 0.7. This value, for the case of Spain, translates to a total lockdown with the exception of the mobility associated to essential services, a policy that was finally enforced on March 28.","Arenas, A.; Cota, W.; Gomez-Gardenes, J.; Gomez, S.; Granell, C.; Matamalas, J.

373,N95 Mask Decontamination using Standard Hospital Sterilization Technologies,"The response to the COVID19 epidemic is generating severe shortages of personal protective equipment around the world. In particular, the supply of N95 respirator masks has become severely depleted with supplies having to be rationed and health care workers having to use masks for prolonged periods in many countries. We sought to test the ability of 4 different decontamination methods including autoclave treatment, ethylene oxide gassing, ionized hydrogen peroxide fogging and vaporized hydrogen peroxide exposure to decontaminate 4 different N95 masks of experimental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or vesicular stomatitis virus as a surrogate. In addition, we sought to determine whether masks would tolerate repeated cycles of decontamination while maintaining structural and functional integrity. We found that one cycle of treatment with all modalities was effective in decontamination and was associated with no structural or functional deterioration. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatment was tolerated to at least 5 cycles by masks. Most notably, standard autoclave treatment was associated with no loss of structural or functional integrity to a minimum of 10 cycles for the 3 pleated mask models. The molded N95 mask however tolerated only 1 cycle. This last finding may be of particular use to institutions globally due to the virtually universal accessibility of autoclaves in health care settings.","Kumar, A.; Kasloff, S.

375,A model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the first three-month surveillance data in Brazil.,"Background: COVID-19 diagnosis is a critical problem, mainly due to the lack or delay in the test results. We aimed to obtain a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected patients reported to the Brazilian surveillance system. Methods: We analyzed suspected patients reported to the National Surveillance System that corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who traveled to regions with local or community transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. Based on variables routinely collected, we obtained a multiple model using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy indicators were used for validation. Results: We described 1468 COVID-19 cases (confirmed by RT-PCR) and 4271 patients with other illnesses. With a data subset, including 80% of patients from Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio Janeiro (RJ), we obtained a function which reached an AUC of 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41% - 96.67%) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and accuracy of 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%). In a validation dataset including the other 20% of patients from SP and RJ, this model exhibited an AUC of 95.01% (92.51% - 97.5%) and accuracy of 89.47% (sensitivity 87.32% and specificity 91.36%). Conclusion: We obtained a model suitable for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 based on routinely collected surveillance data. Applications of this tool include early identification for specific treatment and isolation, rational use of laboratory tests, and input for modeling epidemiological trends.","Diaz-Quijano, F.

376,Physician Deaths from Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19),"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused much morbidity and mortality to patients but also health care providers. We tabulated the cases of physician deaths from COVID-19 associated with front-line work in hopes of mitigating future events. METHOD: On April 5, 2020, Google internet search was performed using the keywords doctor, physician, death, COVID, COVID-19, and coronavirus in English and Farsi, and in Chinese using the Baidu search engine. RESULTS: We found 198 physician deaths from COVID-19, but complete details were missing for 49 individuals. The average age of the physicians that died was 63.4 years (range 28 to 90 years) and the median age was 66 years of age. Ninety percent of the deceased physicians were male (175/194). General practitioners and emergency room doctors (78/192), respirologists (5/192), internal medicine specialists (11/192) and anesthesiologists (6/192) comprised 52% of those dying. Two percent of the deceased were epidemiologists (4/192), 2% were infectious disease specialists (4/192), 5% were dentists (9/192), 4% were ENT (8/192), and 4% were ophthalmologists (7/192). The countries with the most reported physician deaths were Italy (79/198), Iran (43/198), China (16/198), Philippines (14/198), United States (9/192) and Indonesia (7/192). CONCLUSION: Physicians from all specialties may die from COVID, and these deaths will likely increase as the pandemic progresses. Lack of personal protective equipment was cited as a common cause of death. Consideration should be made to exclude older physicians from front-line work.","Ing, E. B.; Xu, A.

377,The Potential Use of Unprocessed Sample for RT-qPCR Detection of COVID-19 without an RNA Extraction Step,"Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay is the gold standard recommended to test for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.1-4 It has been used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and several other companies in their Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) assays. With many PCR-based molecular assays, an extraction step is routinely used as part of the protocol. This step can take up a significant amount of time and labor, especially if the extraction is performed manually. Long assay time, partly caused by slow sample preparation steps, has created a large backlog when testing patient samples suspected of COVID-19. Using flu and RSV clinical specimens, we have collected evidence that the RT-qPCR assay can be performed directly on patient sample material from a nasal swab immersed in virus transport medium (VTM) without an RNA extraction step. We have also used this approach to test for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 reference materials spiked in VTM. Our data, while preliminary, suggest that using a few microliters of these untreated samples still can lead to sensitive test results. If RNA extraction steps can be omitted without significantly affecting clinical sensitivity, the turn-around time of COVID-19 tests and the backlog we currently experience can be reduced drastically. Next, we will confirm our findings using patient samples.","Arumugam, A.; Wong, S.

378,Noisy Pooled PCR for Virus Testing,"Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite their accuracy for single sample analysis, infectious diseases diagnostic tools, like RT-PCR, require substantial resources to test large populations. We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized. Finally, in a Utopian world we would have collaborated with RT-PCR experts; it is difficult to form such connections during a pandemic. We welcome new collaborators to reach out and help improve this work!","Zhu, J.; Rivera, K.; Baron, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.026765v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.026765v1?rss=1,2020-04-08,2020-04-08,,False
379,LAMP-Seq: Population-Scale COVID-19 Diagnostics Using a Compressed Barcode Space,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has already caused devastating losses. Early evidence shows that the exponential spread of COVID-19 can be slowed by restrictive isolation measures, but these place a tremendous burden on society. Moreover, once these restrictions are lifted, the exponential spread is likely to re-emerge. It has been suggested that population-scale testing can help break the cycle of isolation and spread, but current detection methods are not capable of such large-scale processing. Here we propose LAMP-Seq, a barcoded Reverse-Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) protocol that could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of population-scale testing. In this approach, individual samples are processed in a single heat step, producing barcoded amplicons that can be shipped to a sequencing center, pooled, and analyzed en masse. Using unique barcode combinations per sample from a compressed barcode space enables extensive pooling, significantly reducing cost and organizational efforts. Given the low cost and scalability of next-generation sequencing, we believe that this method can be affordably scaled to analyze millions of samples per day using existing sequencing infrastructure.","Schmid-Burgk, J.

Here we report an in-depth molecular analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary origins of the enhanced pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that are severe human pathogens. Using integrated comparative genomics and machine learning techniques, we identify key genomic features that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 and the viruses behind the two previous deadly coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, from less pathogenic coronaviruses. These features include enhancement of the nuclear localization signals in the nucleocapsid protein and distinct inserts in the spike glycoprotein that appear to be associated with high case fatality rate of these coronaviruses as well as the host switch from animals to humans. The identified features could be crucial elements of coronavirus pathogenicity and possible targets for diagnostics, prognostication and interventions.","Auslander, N.; Gussow, A. B.; Wolf, Y.

382,Sequence-based prediction of vaccine targets for inducing T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 utilizing the bioinformatics predictor RECON,"BackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgency to identify novel vaccine targets for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with observations for SARS-CoV, a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, early reports identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS CoV-2.

MethodsIn this study, we leveraged HLA-I and HLA-II T cell epitope prediction tools from RECON(R) (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology), our bioinformatic pipeline that was developed using proteomic profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict rules for peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family, and specifically to identify SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes.

ResultsTo test the suitability of these tools to identify viral T cell epitopes, we first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then use our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,776 HLA-I and 7,991 HLA-II candidate binding peptides across all 12 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. This extensive list of identified candidate peptides is driven by the length of the ORFs and the significant number of HLA-I and HLA-II alleles that we are able to predict (74 and 83, respectively), providing over 99% coverage for the US, European and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II. From our SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the ViPR database, originating from other forms of coronaviruses. 320 of these pairs (89.1%) had a positive MHC-binding assay result. This analysis reinforces the validity our predictions.

ConclusionsUsing this bioinformatic platform, we identify multiple putative epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells whose HLA binding properties cover nearly the entire population and thus may be effective when included in prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to induce broad cellular immunity.","Poran, A.; Harjanto, D.; Malloy, M.; Rooney, M.

No specific treatment has been established against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) so far. Therefore, it is urgently needed to identify effective antiviral agents for the treatment of this disease, and several approved drugs such as lopinavir have been evaluated. Here, we report that nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, potently inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2. The effective concentrations for 50% and 90% inhibition (EC50 and EC90) of nelfinavir were 1.13 {micro}M and 1.76 {micro}M respectively, the lowest of the nine HIV-1 protease inhibitors including lopinavir. The trough and peak serum concentrations of nelfinavir were three to six times higher than EC50 of this drug.

There are currently no definitive data on the safety and efficacy of DRV/cobicistat for treatment of COVID-19. The in vitro antiviral activity of darunavir against a clinical isolate from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. DRV showed no activity against SARS-CoV-2 at clinically relevant concentrations (EC50 >100 M). Remdesivir, used as a positive control, showed potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.38 M).

386,Interaction between malarial transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map: A changing landscape human immune system?,"Background: COVID-19 (Corona virus Disease-2019) is a new public health emergency and is a pandemic currently. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 vary in different geographical areas. In this study we aimed to analyse the relationship between malaria transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map. Materials and methods: We collected malaria cases data (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2018), worldwide COVID-19 cases and mortality data (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and data on BCG vaccination. COVID-19 incidence and mortality was compared. Findings: Data on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were analysed. Malaria incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (correlation coefficient = -0.513, p<0.001). Malaria free countries had significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases compared to malaria endemic countries. In Europe and Americas, countries, which have higher BCG vaccination coverage, had significantly less mortality per thousand population compared to those with low BCG coverage (median 0.0002 (0-0.0005) vs 0.0029 (0.0002-0.0177), p=0.017). The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was related nonlinearly to the malaria incidence. Conclusions: The results suggest the changing human immune system as we progress to eliminate parasitic diseases with time. Chloroquine exposure in malaria endemic zones might have a protective effect.","Goswami, R. P.; Mittal, D. K.; Goswami, R.

DESIGN: This is the protocol of a living systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries, grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We will follow a common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews, already published and submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation). We will include randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs - versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.","Bravo Jeria, R.; Rojas Reyes, M. X.; Franco, J. V.; Acuna, M.

We model the current scenario of closed schools and universities, social distancing of individuals above sixty years old and voluntary home quarantine to show that it led to a considerable reduction in the number of infections as compared with a scenario without any control measures. Notwithstanding, our model predicts that the current measures are not enough to avoid overloading the health system, since the demand for intensive care units will soon surpass the number available. We also show that an urgent intense quarantine might be the only solution to avoid this scenario and, consequently, minimize the number of severe cases and deaths. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the early relaxation of the undergoing isolation measures would lead to an increase of millions of infections in a short period of time and the consecutive collapse of the health system.","Canabarro, A.; Tenorio, E.; Martins, R.; Martins, L.; Brito, S.; Chaves, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052498v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052498v1?rss=1,2020-04-08,2020-04-08,,True
389,Targeting the catecholamine-cytokine axis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm syndrome,"The mortality of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears to be driven by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of COVID-19 is characterized by the development of a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels are predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Targeting hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 may be critical for reducing mortality. Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (1-AR) signaling. Prophylactic inhibition of catecholamine synthesis with the 1-AR antagonist prazosin reduced catecholamines and cytokine responses in mice, and resulted in markedly increased survival following various hyper-inflammatory stimuli. These findings offer a rationale for studying 1-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of patients with COVID-19-CSS and ARDS. As high infection rates threaten to overwhelm hospital capacity during this pandemic, preventative approaches that ameliorate COVID-19 severity and reduce excessive mortality are desperately needed. We hypothesize that treatment with prazosin of individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 could reduce catecholamine surges, secondary cytokine dysregulation, and mortality. To investigate a potential role for 1-AR antagonists in preventing poor outcomes in ARDS, we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients diagnosed with ARDS. Using data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database (2010-2017), we identified 12,673 men (age 45-64) with ARDS, of whom 1,189 patients (9.4%) were prescribed 1-AR antagonists in the previous year. Applying logistic regression models, we found that patients with prior use of 1-AR antagonists had lower odds of the composite of need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality compared to non-users (AOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.94, p=0.008). Mirroring findings from pre-clinical models, these data support a clinical rationale to study 1-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of ARDS and states of local and systemic immune dysregulation. Prospective, randomized clinical trials of alpha-1 receptor antagonists (e.g. prazosin) administered prior to the onset of severe symptoms are needed to assess their efficacy in preventing CSS and reducing mortality in COVID-19.","Konig, M.

390,Optimize Clinical Laboratory Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Suspect Cases by Likelihood Ratio of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody,"Objective: To optimize clinical laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspect cases by Likelihood Ratio of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody. Methods: By reinterpreting the data in the article ""Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum 2019 novel coronavirus IgM and IgG Antibodies in novel coronavirusin Infection"", the positive likelihood ratio of IgM and IgG antibody in diagnosis of COVID-19 (nucleic acid positive patients) was calculated, and the posterior probability of IgM and IgG antibodies and their tandem detection to diagnose was finally calculated. Results: The positive likelihood ratios of single IgM and IgG antibody were 18.50 and 12.65 respectively, and the posterior probabilities were 90.18% and 86.26% respectively. However, the posterior probability of the two antibodies tandem detection is 99.15%, which can give clinicians quantitative confidence in the diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspected cases. According to the results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection, the clinical pathway for clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 is found. Conclusion: For suspected cases, IgM and IgG antibody tests should be firstly done at the same time. If the antibody tests are all positive, COVID-19 can be confirmed. If not, nucleic acid detection (one or more times) is performed, and in extreme cases, high-throughput viral genome sequencing is performed.","Yangchun, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20053660v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20053660v1?rss=1,2020-04-08,2020-04-08,,True
391,Feasibility of Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK by Rolling Interventions,"Background: Recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has led a rapid global spread around the world. For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lockdowns in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple pharmaceutical interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand. Methods: We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London, the UK (non-London) and the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. Findings: We estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65th day (April 11th), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.","Yang, P.; Qi, J.; Zhang, S.; Bi, G.; Wang, X.; Yang, Y.; Sheng, B.; Mao, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054429v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True

We tested wastewater collected at a major urban treatment facility in Massachusetts and found the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at high titers in the period from March 18 - 25 using RT-qPCR. We then confirmed the identity of the PCR product by direct DNA sequencing. Viral titers observed were significantly higher than expected based on clinically confirmed cases in Massachusetts as of March 25. The reason for the discrepancy is not yet clear, however, and until further experiments are complete, these data do not necessarily indicate that clinical estimates are incorrect. Our approach is scalable and may be useful in modeling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and future outbreaks.","Wu, F.; Xiao, A.; Zhang, J.; Gu, X.; Lee, W.

395,The relationship of COVID-19 severity with cardiovascular disease and its traditional risk factors: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its traditional risk factors predict severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uncertain, in part, because of potential confounding by age and sex. Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data ([&ge;]10 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 373 publications identified in our search, 15 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 51,845 COVID-19 patients including 9,066 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 vs. <50 years. Two studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors significantly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (14 studies; pooled RR=1.70, [95%CI 1.52-1.89]), hypertension (10 studies; 2.74 [2.12-3.54]), diabetes (11 studies; 2.81 [2.01-3.93]), and CVD (9 studies; 3.58 [2.06-6.21]). RR for male sex was likely to be independent of age. Meta-regression analyses were suggestive of confounding by age for the other three factors. Only two studies reported multivariable analysis, with one showing non-significant association for CVD and the other demonstrating adjusted RR ~2 for hypertension and diabetes. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: In addition to older age and male sex, hypertension, diabetes, and CVD were associated in univariate analyses with severe COVID-19. Although there is still uncertainty regarding the magnitude of potential confounding, these risk factors can be used to inform objective decisions on COVID-19 testing, clinical management, and workforce planning.","Matsushita, K.; Ding, N.; Kou, M.; Hu, X.; Chen, M.; Gao, Y.; Honda, Y.; Dowdy, D.; Mok, Y.; Ishigami, J.; Appel, L.

Methods: We collected data of the Covid-19 patients. 107 surface samples, 46 air samples, two exhaled condensate samples, and two expired air samples were collected were collected within and beyond the four three-bed isolation rooms. We reviewed the environmental design of the building and the cleaning routines. We conducted field measurement of airflow and CO2 concentrations. Findings: The 107 surface samples comprised 37 from toilets, 34 from other surfaces in isolation rooms (ventilated at 30-60 L/s), and 36 from other surfaces outside isolation rooms in the hospital. Four of these samples were positive, namely two ward door-handles, one bathroom toilet-seat cover and one bathroom door-handle; and three were weakly positive, namely one bathroom toilet seat, one bathroom washbasin tap lever and one bathroom ceiling-exhaust louvre. One of the 46 air samples was weakly positive, and this was a corridor air sample. The two exhaled condensate samples and the two expired air samples were negative. Interpretation: The faecal-derived aerosols in patients' toilets contained most of the detected SARS-CoV-2 virus in the hospital, highlighting the importance of surface and hand hygiene for intervention.","Ding, Z.; Qian, H.; Xu, B.; Huang, Y.; Miao, T.; Yen, H.-L.; Xiao, S.; Cui, L.; Wu, X.; Shao, W.; Song, Y.; Sha, L.; Zhou, L.; Xu, Y.; Zhu, B.; Li, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052175v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052175v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
397,Analysis and Applications of Non-Adaptive and Adaptive Group Testing Methods for COVID-19,"Abstract Testing strategies for Covid-19 to maximize number of people tested is urgently needed. Recently, it has been demonstrated that RT-PCR has the sensitivity to detect one positive case in a mixed sample 32 cases [9]. In this paper we propose non-adaptive and adaptive group testing strategies based on generalized binary splitting (GBS) [2] where we restrict the group test to the largest group that can be used. The method starts by choosing a group from the population to be tested, performing a test on the combined sample from the entire group and progressively splitting the group further into subgroups. Compared to individual testing at 4% prevalence we save 74% at 1% we save 91% and at 1% we save 97% of tests. We analyze the number of times each sample is used and show the method is still efficient if we resort to testing a case individually if the sample is running low. Abstract In addition we recommend clinical screening to filter out individuals with symptoms and show this leaves us with a population with lower prevalence. Our approach is particularly applicable to vulnerable confined populations such as nursing homes, prisons, military ships and cruise ships.","Mentus, C.; Romeo, M.; DiPaola, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20050245v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20050245v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True

399,"COVID-19 pandemic: Impact of lockdown, contact and non-contact transmissions on infection dynamics","COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has virtually locked down the entire world of human population, and through its rapid and unstoppable spread COVID-19 has essentially compartmentalised the population merely into susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered classes. Adapting the classical epidemic modelling framework, two distinct routes of COVID-19 transmission are incorporated into a model: (a) direct person-to-person contact transmission, and (b) indirect airborne and fomites-driven transmission. The indirect non-contact transmission route needs to explored in models of COVID-19 spread, because evidences show that this route of transmission is entirely viable with hugely uncertain level of relative contribution. This theoretical study based on model simulations demonstrates the following: (1) Not incorporating indirect transmission route in the model leads to underestimation of the basic reproduction number, and hence will impact on the COVID-19 mitigation decisions; (2) Lockdown measures can suppress the primary infection peak, but will lead to a secondary peak whose relative strength and time of occurrence depend on the success and duration of the lockdown measures; (3) To make lockdown effective, a considerable level of reduction in both contact and non-contact transmission rates over a long period is required; (4) To bring down the infection cases below any hypothetical health-care capacity, reduction of non-contact transmission rate is key, and hence active measures should be taken to reduce non-contact transmission (e.g., extensive uses of areal and aerosol disinfectant in public spaces to improve contaminated surfaces and air); (5) Any premature withdrawal of lockdown following the sign of a brief retracement in the infection cases can backfire, and can lead to a quicker, sharper and higher secondary peak, due to reactivation of the two transmission routes. Based on these results, this study recommends that any exit policy from lockdown, should take into account the level of transmission reduction in both routes, the absolute scale of which will vary among countries depending on their health-service capacity, but should be computed using accurate time-series data on infection cases and transmission rates.","Roy, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20050328v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20050328v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
400,Increased Detection coupled with Social Distancing and Health Capacity Planning Reduce the Burden of COVID-19 Cases and Fatalities: A Proof of Concept Study using a Stochastic Computational Simulation Model,"Objective: In absence of any vaccine, the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being contained through a non-pharmaceutical measure termed Social Distancing (SD). However, whether SD alone is enough to flatten the epidemic curve is debatable. Using a Stochastic Computational Simulation Model, we investigated the impact of increasing SD, hospital beds and COVID-19 detection rates in preventing COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Research Design and Methods: The Stochastic Simulation Model was built using the EpiModel package in R. As a proof of concept study, we ran the simulation on Kasaragod, the most affected district in Kerala. We added 3 compartments to the SEIR model to obtain a SEIQHRF (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalised-Recovered-Fatal) model. Results: Implementing SD only delayed the appearance of peak prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Doubling of hospital beds could not reduce the fatal cases probably due to its overwhelming number compared to the hospital beds. Increasing detection rates could significantly flatten the curve and reduce the peak prevalence of cases (increasing detection rate by 5 times could reduce case number to half). Conclusions: An effective strategy to contain the epidemic spread of COVID-19 in India is to increase detection rates in combination with SD measures and increase in hospital beds.","Ghosh, P.; Basheer, S.; Paul, S.; Chakrabarti, P.; Sarkar, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054775v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054775v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
401,Thoughts on Higher Medical Education Under Major Public Health Emergencies: Thinking Ahead After COVID-19 Outbreak,"Objective: To explore the most suitable teaching and learning pattern in medical school during COVID-19 Outbreak. Design: This study is a case-control study. We had tried to apply a new blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction to the students before the outbreak and then universities responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by closing campuses and shifting to other forms of distance learning. In other word, the courses started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Five Point Likert Scale Questionnaires which contains 20 items were used, and the effect of the two kinds of teaching patterns was compared by evaluating the indicators of core competencies of students including professionalism, attitude towards learning, knowledge and learning skills, teamwork skills, motivation in learning, adaptability and acceptance of the courses and network environment. Setting: Our study based on a single center. Participants: Fifty fourth-year medical students receiving the 5+3 pattern courses regarding internal medicine were enrolled in the study. Exposure(s) :The teaching and learning patter started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Main Outcome: According to the descriptive statistical analysis of the first part of the questionnaire (question 1-16), the average score of adaptability and acceptance of the courses is 2.60 lower than 3, indicating that students are more adapted to other forms of distance learning during COVID-19 outbreak; the average score of the rest of the questions is higher than 3, indicating that blended teaching model based on 5G network is superior to other forms of distance learning. The number of male students who are inclined to the blended teaching model based on 5G network is 0.13 times as much as that of female students (95%CI:0.028~0.602, p=0.009). Results: Online forms of distance learning were accepted by the students. Female students had higher expectations on the course and were more likely to adapt well to the change during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, all students preferred the blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction before the pandemic. Conclusion: It indicates that medical education based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction is a more suitable option to teach medical students online.

BCG vaccination may thus serve as a protective factor against COVID-19. Here, we drew on day-by-day reports of both confirmed cases and deaths and analyzed growth curves in countries that mandate BCG policies versus countries that do not. Linear mixed models revealed that the presence of mandated BCG policies was associated with a significant flattening of the exponential increase in both confirmed cases and deaths during the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks. This effect held after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, geographic region, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms).

404,Fast spread of COVID-19 in Europe and the US and its implications: even modest public health goals require comprehensive intervention,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused more than 800,000 infections and 40,000 deaths by the end of March 2020. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and R0 are debated. We developed an inference approach to control for confounding factors in data collection, such as under-reporting and changes in surveillance intensities, and fitted a mathematical model to infection and death count data collected from eight European countries and the US. In all countries, the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.7 days). This suggests a highly infectious virus with an R0 likely between 4.0 and 7.1. We show that similar levels of intervention efforts are needed, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. Early, strong and comprehensive intervention efforts to achieve greater than 74-86% reduction in transmission are necessary.","Ke, R.; Sanche, S.; Romero-Severson, E.; Hengartner, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20050427v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20050427v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
405,COVID-19 diagnosis prediction in emergency care patients: a machine learning approach,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the necessity of immediate clinical decisions and effective usage of healthcare resources. Currently, the most validated diagnosis test for COVID-19 (RT-PCR) is in shortage in most developing countries, which may increase infection rates and delay important preventive measures. The objective of this study was to predict the risk of positive COVID-19 diagnosis with machine learning, using as predictors only results from emergency care admission exams. We collected data from a sample of 235 adult patients from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 17 to 30 of March, 2020, of which 102 (43%) received a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 from RT-PCR tests. Five machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting trees, logistic regression and support vector machines) were trained on a random sample of 70% of the patients, and performance was tested on new unseen data (30%). The best predictive performance was obtained by the support vector machines algorithm (AUC: 0.85; Sensitivity: 0.68; Specificity: 0.85; Brier Score: 0.16). In conclusion, we found that targeted decisions for receiving COVID-19 tests using only routinely-collected data is a promising new area with the use of machine learning algorithms.","Batista, A.

408,Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients,"Background: Numerous groups have reported the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases; however, the data remained inconsistent. This paper aimed to pool the available data to provide a more complete picture of the characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic review and pooled analysis was performed. Eligible studies were identified from database and hand searches up to March 2, 2020. Data on clinical (including laboratory and radiological) and epidemiological (including demographic) characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases were extracted and combined by simple pooling. Results: Of 644 studies identified, 69 studies (involving 48,926 patients) were included in the analysis. The average age of the patients was 49.16 years. A total of 51.46% of the patients were men and 52.32% were non-smokers. Hypertension (50.82%) and diabetes (20.89%) were the most frequent comorbidities observed. The most common symptoms were fever (83.21%), cough (61.74%), and myalgia or fatigue (30.22%). Altered levels of blood and biochemical parameters were observed in a proportion of the patients. Most of the patients (78.50%) had bilateral lung involvements, and 5.86% showed no CT findings indicative of viral pneumonia. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (28.36%), acute cardiac injury (7.89%) and acute kidney injury (7.60%) were the most common complications recorded. Conclusions: Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were mostly heterogeneous and non-specific.

In order to reduce peak viral load by more than 2 logs, drug efficacy needs to be greater than 80% if treatment is administered after symptom onset; an efficacy of 50% could be sufficient if treatment is initiated before symptom onset. Given their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, current investigated drugs may be in a range of 20-70% efficacy. They may help control virus if administered very early, but may not have a major effect in severe patients.","Goncalves, A.; Bertrand, J.; Ke, R.; Comets, E.; de Lamballerie, X.; Malvy, D.; Pizzorno, A.; Terrier, O.; Calatrava, M.

411,Corona Epidemic in Indian context: Predictive Mathematical Modelling,"The novel Coronavirus pathogen Covid-19 is a cause of concern across the world as the human-to-human infection caused by it is spreading at a fast pace. The virus that first manifested in Wuhan, China has travelled across continents. The increase in number of deaths in Italy, Iran, USA, and other countries has alarmed both the developed and developing countries. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine against the virus, but until now no breakthrough has been achieved. India, the second most populated country in the world, is working hard in all dimensions to stop the spread of community infection. Health care facilities are being updated; medical and paramedical staffs are getting trained, and many agencies are raising awareness on the issues related to this virus and its transmission. The administration is leaving no stone unturned to prepare the country to mitigate the adverse effects. However, as the number of infected patients, and those getting cured is changing differently in different states everyday it is difficult to predict the spread of the virus and its fate in Indian context. Different states have adopted measures to stop the community spread. Considering the vast size of the country, the population size and other socio-economic conditions of the states, a single uniform policy may not work to contain the disease. In this paper, we discuss a predictive mathematical model that can give us some idea of the fate of the virus, an indicative data and future projections to understand the further course this pandemic can take. The data can be used by the health care agencies, the Government Organizations and the Planning Commission to make suitable arrangements to fight the pandemic. Though the model is preliminary, it can be used at regional level to manage the health care system in the present scenario. The recommendations can be made, and advisories prepared based on the predictive results that can be implemented at regional levels.","Bhola, J.; Revathi Venkateswaran, V.; Koul, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20047175v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20047175v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
412,Management of rheumatic diseases in the times of COVID-19 pandemic- perspectives of rheumatology practitioners from India,"Background. The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to widespread concerns about the risk of infection in patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) receiving disease modifying ant-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and other immunosuppressants (IS). Methods. A SurveyMonkey based electronic survey was conducted amongst members of the Indian Rheumatology Association to understand the need for changes in prevailing practices. Results. Of the 861 invitees, 221 responded. In the wake of the pandemic, 47.5% would reduce biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) while only 12.2% would reduce the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs. 64.2% were likely to defer change in IS, the reluctance being most with rituximab (58.3%) followed by cyclophosphamide (53.3%), anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents (52.4%) and Janus kinase inhibitors (34.39%). Hydroxychloroquine was the preferred choice (81.9%) for the treatment of COVID-19 followed by protease inhibitors (22.1%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (8.1%). Chloroquine was less preferred (19%). More than two-thirds (70.5%) believed that COVID-19 might trigger macrophage activation syndrome. Social distancing (98.1%) and hand hygiene (74.6%) were recommended by majority. 62.8% would avoid touch for clinical examination whenever feasible. Conclusion. Most rheumatologists perceived the need to change treatment of RDs during the COVID-19 pandemic; reduce immunosuppression and defer the usage of rituximab and bDMARDs.","Gupta, L.; Misra, D.; Agarwal, V.; Balan, S.; Agarwal, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20048389v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20048389v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
413,Sudden hyposmia as a prevalent symptom of COVID-19 infection.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic that has involved Italy as the second worldwide nation in terms of infected patients and deaths. The clinical manifestation of Covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic carrier status to severe pneumonia. Asymptomatic individuals in Covid-19 are those who are carriers of the virus but do not show clinical symptoms and are able to transmit the disease in the same degree as symptomatic carriers. In order to contain contagions is of supreme importance to identify asymptomatic patients because this subpopulation is one of the main factors contributing to the spread of this disease. We report on six Italian patients with COVID-19 who presented sudden hyposmia as the only or most prominent disease manifestation, without upper or lower respiratory tract involvement or other major features of the disease. A supra-threshold olfaction test confirmed the hyposmia in all patients. The onset of hyposmia during a Covid-19 outbreak should be considered as a warning sign of an infection that requires a diagnostic test for Covid-19","Marchese-Ragona, R.; Ottaviano, G.; Nicolai, P.; Vianello, A.; Carecchio, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20045393v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.20045393v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True

Also, information regarding the immunological characteristics in COVID-19 patients remains limited. Here we collected the blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HD) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyze changes in {gamma}{delta} T cells. In comparison to HD, the {gamma}{delta} T cells percentage was decreased. {gamma}{delta} T cells are able to immediately respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection and upregulate the activation marker CD25. In addition, the increased expression of CD4 in {gamma}{delta} T cells may serve as a biomarker for the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lei, L.; Qian, H.; Yang, X.; Zhou, X.; Zhang, X.; Zhang, D.; Dai, T.; Guo, R.; Shi, L.; Cheng, Y.; Zhang, B.; Hu, J.

Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was consulted to report this systematic review. Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chinese) database. Results: A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24-0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11-0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials, case-control studies and retrospective studies. Conclusions: This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks, we stress that the use masks serve as an adjunctive method regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.","Liang, M.; Gao, L.; Cheng, C.; Zhou, Q.; Uy, J.

416,A Systematic Meta-Analysis of CT Features of COVID-19: Lessons from Radiology,"Several studies have been published in the past few months describing the CT features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a great degree of heterogeneity in the study designs, lesion descriptors used and conclusions derived. In our systematic analysis and meta-review, we have attempted to homogenize the reported features and provide a comprehensive view of the disease pattern and progression in different clinical stages. After an extensive literature search, we short-listed and reviewed 49 studies including over 4145 patients with 3615 RT-PCR positive cases of COVID-19 disease. We have found that there is a good agreement among these studies that diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) is the most common finding at all stages of the disease followed by consolidations and mixed density lesions. 78% of patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections had either ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both. Inter-lobular septal thickening was also found to be a common feature in many patients in advanced stages. The progression of these initial patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidations to diffuse lesions with septal thickening, air bronchograms in the advanced stages, to either diffuse white-out lungs needing ICU admissions or finally resolving completely without or with residual fibrotic strips was also found to be congruent among multiple studies. Prominent juxta-lesional pulmonary vessels, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy in RT-PCR proven cases were found to have poor clinical prognosis. Additionally, we noted wide variation in terminology used to describe lesions across studies and suggest the use of standardized lexicons to describe findings related to diseases of vital importance.","Venugopal, V.

417,A globally available COVID-19 - Template for clinical imaging studies,"Background The pandemic spread of COVID-19 has caused worldwide implications on societies and economies. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been found to support both, current diagnostic and disease monitoring. A joint approach to collect, analyze and share clinical and imaging information about COVID-19 in the highest quality possible is urgently needed. Methods An evidence-based reporting template was developed for assessing COVID-19 pneumonia using an FDA-approved medical software. The annotation of qualitative and quantitative findings including radiomics features is performed directly on primary imaging data. For data collection, secondary information from the patient history and clinical data such as symptoms and comorbidities are queried. Results License-royalty free, cloud-based web platform and on-premise deployments are offered. Hospitals can upload, assess, report and if pseudonymized share their COVID-19 cases. The aggregation of radiomics in correlation with rt-PCR, patient history, clinical and radiological findings, systematically documented in a single database, will lead to optimized diagnosis, risk stratification and response evaluation. A customizable analytics dashboard allows the explorative real-time data analysis of imaging features and clinical information. Conclusions The COVID-19-Template is based on a systematic, computer-assisted and context-guided approach to collect, analyze and share data. Epidemiological and clinical studies for therapies and vaccine candidates can be implemented in compliance with high data quality, integrity and traceability.","Salg, G. A.; Ganten, M.

418,Efficient and Practical Sample Pooling High-Throughput PCR Diagnosis of COVID-19,"Diagnostic assays using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) most commonly process patient samples one by one. While this is usually an effective and reliable method, the current efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic demand more efficient measures. Diagnostic assays can be scaled up by the method of High-Throughput qPCR via sample pooling. Pooling, the action of combining multiple samples into one tube, is most effective when the chance of positive detection of the target, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, is low. In such cases, large groups of samples can be conclusively classified as negative with a single test, with no need to individually test every sample. However, different frequencies of the target-product presence in the samples, require different pool/batch sizes for optimal results. Here, we present two possible optimized pooling strategies for diagnostic SARSCoV-2 testing on large scales, each one better suited for a different range of target frequency. In the first, we employ a simple information-theoretic heuristic to derive a highly efficient re-pooling protocol: an estimate of the target frequency determines the initial pool size, and any subsequent pools found positive are re-pooled at half-size and tested again. In the range of very rare target (<0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically. For example, this method achieves a reduction of a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools. We show that this approach is just as efficient for moderate target-product frequencies (0.05<0.2). For example, it reduces the number of tests needed by half if the frequency of positives samples is 0.07. We show that both methods are comparable to the absolute upper-bound efficiency given by Shannon's source coding theorem. Our strategies require no investment at all, and they offer a significant reduction in the amount of equipment and time needed to test large numbers of samples. Both approaches are dynamic; they can be easily implemented in different conditions with various infection rates and sample numbers. We compare our strategies to the naive way of testing and also to alternative matrix methods. Most importantly, we offer practical pooling instructions for laboratories that perform large scale qPCR assays to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.","Shani-Narkiss, H.; Gilday, O.

419,Loss of smell and taste in combination with other symptoms is a strong predictor of COVID-19 infection,"Importance: A strategy for preventing further spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic is to detect infections and isolate infected individuals without the need of extensive bio-specimen testing. Objectives: Here we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among COVID-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms, besides loss of smell and taste, most likely to correspond to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis in non-severe cases. Design: Community survey. Setting and Participants: Subscribers of RADAR COVID-19, an app that was launched for use among the UK general population asking about COVID-19 symptoms. Main Exposure: Loss of smell and taste. Main Outcome Measures: COVID-19. Results: Between 24 and 29 March 2020, 1,573,103 individuals reported their symptoms via the app; 26% reported suffering from one or more symptoms of COVID-19. Of those, n=1702 reported having had a RT-PCR COVID-19 test and gave full report on symptoms including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative. In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10-59 . We also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of COVID-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44; 0.63], specificity 0.86[0.80; 0.90], ROC-AUC 0.77[0.72; 0.82] in the test set, and cross-validation ROC-AUC 0.75[0.72; 0.77]. When applied to the 410,598 individuals reporting symptoms but not formally tested, our model predicted that 13.06%[12.97%;13.15] of these might have been already infected by the virus. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study suggests that loss of taste and smell is a strong predictor of having been infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, the combination of symptoms that could be used to identify and isolate individuals includes anosmia, fever, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fatigue, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. This is particularly relevant to healthcare and other key workers in constant contact with the public who have not yet been tested for COVID-19.","Menni, C.; Valdes, A.; Freydin, M.

420,A statistical method of batch screening entrying population from abroad by stages and groups in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing,"Abstract Objective: To screen out COVID-19 patients in entrying population from abroad with the minimum number of nucleic acid testing (NAT). Methods: In the first stage, the nasopharyngeal swab samples of the entrying population are numbered and grouped. After the samples in the group are mixed together, one NAT was performed. When the test result is negative, it shows that all of the peple in the group are not infected and the test for the group is complete. On the contrary, when the test result is positive, the group enters the second stage. In the second stage, all samples in the positive group will be tested one by one using the NAT. Results: The advantages and precautions of the method were discussed. The incidence rate of entrying population is the determinant of the number of samples in the group. The lower the incidence rate, the larger the number of samples in the group, and the greater the percentage saved. Conclusion: The method has obvious efficiency and cost advantages in COVID-19 testing.

422,"An ""Infodemic"": Leveraging High-Volume Twitter Data to Understand Public Sentiment for the COVID-19 Outbreak","Background: Twitter has been used to track trends and disseminate health information during viral epidemics. On January 21, 2020, the CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center and the WHO released its first situation report about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), sparking significant media attention. How Twitter content and sentiment has evolved in the early stages of any outbreak, including the COVID-19 epidemic, has not been described. Objective: To quantify and understand early changes in Twitter activity, content, and sentiment about the COVID-19 epidemic. Design: Observational study. Setting: Twitter platform. Participants: All Twitter users who created or sent a message from January 14th to 28th, 2020. Measurements: We extracted tweets matching hashtags related to COVID-19 and measured frequency of keywords related to infection prevention practices, vaccination, and racial prejudice. We performed a sentiment analysis to identify emotional valence and predominant emotions. We conducted topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. Results: We evaluated 126,049 tweets from 53,196 unique users. The hourly number of COVID-19-related tweets starkly increased from January 21, 2020 onward. Nearly half (49.5%) of all tweets expressed fear and nearly 30% expressed surprise. The frequency of racially charged tweets closely paralleled the number of newly diagnosed cases of COVID-19. The economic and political impact of the COVID-19 was the most commonly discussed topic, while public health risk and prevention were among the least discussed. Conclusion: Tweets with negative sentiment and emotion parallel the incidence of cases for the COVID-19 outbreak. Twitter is a rich medium that can be leveraged to understand public sentiment in real-time and target public health messages based on user interest and emotion.","Medford, R. J.; Saleh, S.

423,Repurposing Therapeutics for COVID-19: Rapid Prediction of Commercially available drugs through Machine Learning and Docking,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe during the past 3 months. As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The research includes the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Saquinavir (DrugBank ID DB01232) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions. Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID 19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.","Mahapatra, S.; Nath, P.; Chatterjee, M.; Das, N.; Kalita, D.; Roy, P.; Satapathi, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054254v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054254v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
424,A Simulated Single Ventilator / Dual Patient Ventilation Strategy for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The potential for acute shortages of ventilators at the peak of Covid-19 pandemic has raised the possibility of needing to support two patients from a single ventilator. To provide a system for understanding and prototyping designs we have developed a mathematical model of two patients supported by a mechanical ventilator. We propose a standard setup where we simulate the introduction of T-splitters to supply air to two patients and a modified setup where we introduce a variable resistance in each inhalation pathway and one-way valves in each exhalation pathway. Using the standard setup, we demonstrate that ventilating two patients with mismatched lung compliances from a single ventilator will lead to clinically-significant reductions in tidal volume in the patient with the lowest respiratory compliance. Using the modified setup, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve the same tidal volumes in two patients with mismatched lung compliances, and we show that the tidal volume of one patient can be manipulated independently of the other. The results indicate that, with appropriate modifications, two patients could be supported from a single ventilator with independent control of tidal volumes.","Solis-Lemus, J.

We then trained a machine learning model using proteomic and metabolomic measurements from a training cohort of 18 non-severe and 13 severe patients. The model correctly classified severe patients with an accuracy of 93.5%, and was further validated using ten independent patients, seven of which were correctly classified. We identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients implicating dysregulation of macrophage, platelet degranulation and complement system pathways, and massive metabolic suppression. This study shows that it is possible to predict progression to severe COVID-19 disease using serum protein and metabolite biomarkers.

426,EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19,"Since SARS-Cov-2 epidemic appeared in Wuhan China, it became challenge for health authorities to counter Covid-19 epidemic. Early evaluation of suspects, screening for Covid-19 and management posed challenge to health authorities especially in developing countries which were not ready to cope with it. Early mild symptoms appeared during course of disease provide a chance to early detect Covid-19. We use retrospective methodology to collect available data on early sign and symptoms of Covid-19 through accessing World Health Organization (WHO) webpages, New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Nature Journal, Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) network, British Medical Journal (BJM), Lancet and other world renowned journal publications to establish a relationship of early symptoms for detection of Covid-19. Data of 2707 Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases was collected and analyzed for early signs. Available data was categorized into physical and blood biomarkers. This categorized data was assessed for scoring early detection of Covid-19 by scoring Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 formula. Each characteristic was given a score in Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 chart with maximum score of 28. Scoring 16 on chart means Covid-19 will fully develop in near future. Correlation of each sign and symptoms with development of Covid-19 in formula showed significant correlation assessed by Pearson correlation and Spearman Correlation coefficient (rho) showed significant correlation of development of Covid-19 with fever 64.11% (P=0.001), cough 65% and dry mucus 19.67% equally sensitive (P=0.000), leukopenia 19.06% (P=0.006), lymphopenia 52.93% (P=0.005), thrombopenia 19.1% (P=0.013), elevated Aspartate aminotransferase 12.79% (P=0.007) and elevated Alanine aminotransferase 11.34% (P=0.006).

427,Little Risk of the COVID-19 Resurgence on Students in China (outside Hubei) Caused by School Reopening,"Objective: School reopening has not yet started in China where the COVID-19 outbreak has reached ending stage, largely due to a great concern about COVID-19 infections on students. We attempted to quantitatively evaluate the risk of COVID-19 infections on students caused by school reopening. Study design: We collected the data of the numbers of teachers, population size and newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days in typical provinces/cities of China, and then analyzed the risk of COVID-19 infections in schools with respect to each province/city. Methods: A step-by-step procedure was explored to calculate the probability of COVID-19 infections on students as transmitted from infected teachers. Two critical assumptions for analysis were proposed: (i) only locally generated cases were counted while imported cases were omitted; (ii) the secondary attack rate of the COVID-19 virus in schools is similar to that in households in China, ranging from 3-10%. Results: The probability of COVID-19 resurgence within one week on students of primary, middle and high schools in China (outside Hubei) is extremely low (<0.2%) in each province/city, and such probability can be updated daily and weekly based on the newly confirmed cases in the past 14 days. In some areas without newly confirmed cases in the past 14 days, the risk is zero. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for local governments to make risk level-based policies for school reopening. Currently, the risk of COVID-19 infections on students is extremely low in China (outside Hubei) and therefore school reopening can be initiated without the endanger of infections on students.","Long, C.; Zeng, T.; FU, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053645v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053645v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
428,On predicting the novel COVID-19 human infections by using Infectious Disease modelling method in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu during 2020,"Since the introduction of the novel Corona Virus (The COVID 19) to the Chinese city Wuhan in the Hubei province during the late December 2019, the effectiveness of the deadly disease, its human infection, spreading severity and the mortality rate of the infection has been an issue of debate. The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID 19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus (COVID 19) infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus. By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility Exposure Infection Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India. Further, we have utilized the current surveillance data from Health and Family Welfare Department, Government of Tamil Nadu to accurately predict the spreading trend of the infection on a state level.","Ayubali, A.

429,Estimating the effect of physical distancing on the COVID-19 pandemic using an urban mobility index,"Governments around the world are implementing population-wide physical distancing measures in an effort to control transmission of COVID-19, but metrics to evaluate their effectiveness are not readily available. We used a publicly available mobility index based on the relative frequency of trips planned in a popular transit application to evaluate the effect of physical distancing on infection growth rates and reproductive number in 34 states and countries. We found that a 10% decrease in relative mobility in the 2nd week of March was associated with a 11.8% relative decrease (exp({beta}) = 0.882; 95% CI: 0.822, 0.946) in the average daily growth rate in the fourth week of March and a change in the instantaneous reproductive number of -0.054 (95% CI: 0.097, -0.011) in the same period. Our analysis demonstrates that decreases in urban mobility were predictive of declines in epidemic growth at national or sub-national scales. Mobility metrics offer an appealing method to calibrate population-level physical distancing policy and implementation.","Soucy, J.-P. R.; Sturrock, S. L.; Berry, I.; Daneman, N.; MacFadden, D.

430,Susceptible supply limits the role of climate in the COVID-19 pandemic,"Preliminary evidence suggests that climate may modulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Yet it remains unclear whether seasonal and geographic variations in climate can substantially alter the pandemic trajectory, given high susceptibility is a core driver. Here, we use a climate-dependent epidemic model to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic probing different scenarios of climate-dependence based on known coronavirus biology. We find that while variations in humidity may be important for endemic infections, during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 climate may drive only modest changes to pandemic size and duration. Our results suggest that, in the absence of effective control measures, significant cases in the coming months are likely to occur in more humid (warmer) climates, irrespective of the climate-dependence of transmission and that summer temperatures will not substantially limit pandemic growth.","Baker, R.

432,The distress of Iranian adults during the Covid-19 pandemic - More distressed than the Chinese and with different predictors,"Early papers on the mental health of the public during the Covid-19 pandemic surveyed participants from China. Outside of China, Iran has emerged as one of the most affected countries with a high death count and rate. The paper presents the first empirical evidence from Iranian adults during the Covid-19 pandemic on their level of distress and its predictors. On March 25-28, 2020, a dire time for Covid-19 in Iran, we surveyed 1058 adults from all 30 provinces in Iran using the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). The distress level of Iranian adults (mean: 34.54; s.d.: 14.92) was significantly higher (mean difference: 10.9; t=22.7; p<0.0001; 95% CI: 10.0 to 11.8) than that of Chinese adults (mean: 23.65; s.d.: 5.45) as reported in a prior study with the same measure of Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). We also found the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China. Our findings that the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China suggest the need to study the predictors of mental health in individual countries during the Covid-19 pandemic to effectively identify and screen for those more susceptible to mental health issues.","Afshar Jahanshahi, A.; Mokhtari Dinani, M.; Nazarian Madavani, A.; Li, J.; Zhang, S.

433,Face mask use in the general population and optimal resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread in early 2020, causing tens of thousands of deaths, over a million cases and widespread socioeconomic disruption. With no vaccine available and numerous national healthcare systems reaching or exceeding capacity, interventions to limit transmission are urgently needed. While there is broad agreement that travel restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses and schools are beneficial in limiting local and regional spread, and such measures have been adopted in countries around the world, recommendations around the use of face masks for the general population are less consistent internationally. In this study, we examined the role of face masks in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the general population, using epidemic models to estimate the total reduction of infections and deaths under various scenarios. In particular, we examined the optimal deployment of face masks when resources are limited. We found that face masks, even with a limited protective effect, can reduce infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. We consistently found that a random distribution of masks in the population was a suboptimal strategy when resources were limited. Prioritizing coverage among the elderly was more beneficial, while allocating a proportion of available resources for diagnosed infected cases provided further mitigation under a range of scenarios. In summary, face mask use, particularly for a pathogen with relatively common asymptomatic carriage, can effectively provide some mitigation of transmission, while balancing provision between vulnerable healthy persons and symptomatic persons can optimize mitigation efforts when resources are limited.","Worby, C.

436,Generic probabilistic modelling and non-homogeneity issues for the UK epidemic of COVID-19,"Coronavirus COVID-19 spreads through the population mostly based on social contact. To gauge the potential for widespread contagion, to cope with associated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation, more accurate and robust modelling is centrally important for policy making. We provide a flexible modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made. We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with different scenarios. This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR). It is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model, are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent uncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw insights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources, including agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based models. We use the model to assess parameter sensitivity for a number of key variables that characterise the COVID-19 epidemic. We also test several control parameters with respect to their influence on the severity of the outbreak. Our analysis shows that due to inclusion of spatial heterogeneity in the population and the asynchronous timing of the epidemic across different areas, the severity of the epidemic might be lower than expected from other models. We find that one of the most crucial control parameters that may significantly reduce the severity of the epidemic is the degree of separation of vulnerable people and people aged 70 years and over, but note also that isolation of other groups has an effect on the severity of the epidemic. It is important to remember that models are there to advise and not to replace reality, and that any action should be coordinated and approved by public health experts with experience in dealing with epidemics. The computational approach makes it possible for further extensive scenario-based analysis to be undertaken. This and a comprehensive study of sensitivity of the model to different parameters defining COVID-19 and its development will be the subject of our forthcoming paper. In that paper, we shall also extend the model where we will consider different probabilistic scenarios for infected people with mild and severe cases.","Zhigljavsky, A.; Noonan, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053462v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053462v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
437,Predict the next moves of COVID-19: reveal the temperate and tropical countries scenario,"The spread of COVID-19 engulfs almost all the countries and territories of the planet, and infections and fatality are increasing rapidly. The first epi-center of its' massive spread was in Wuhan, Hubei province, China having a temperate weather, but the spread has got an unprecedented momentum in European temperate countries mainly in Italy and Spain (as of March 30, 2020). However, Malaysia and Singapore and the neighboring tropical countries of China got relatively low spread and fatality that created a research interest on whether there are potential impacts of weather condition on COVID-19 spread. Adopting the SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model to predict potential cases and death in the coming days from COVID-19 was done using the secondary and official sources of data. This study shows that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high across the world but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries having lower temperature (7-16{degrees}C) and humidity (80-90%) in last March. However, some literature predicted that this might not to be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a continuous spread and death. Moreover, a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in both temperate and tropical countries may re-outbreak in the coming winter. Therefore, a comprehensive global program with the leadership of WHO for testing of entire population of the world is required, which will be very useful for the individual states to take proper political action, social movement and medical services.","Hasan, N.

438,Exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 mortality in the United States,"Background: United States government scientists estimate that COVID-19 may kill between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans. The majority of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death for COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigate whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases the risk of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. Methods: Data was collected for approximately 3,000 counties in the United States (98% of the population) up to April 04, 2020. We fit zero-inflated negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county level long-term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. We adjust by population size, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables including, but not limited to obesity and smoking. We include a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. Results: We found that an increase of only 1 g/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with a 15% increase in the COVID-19 death rate, 95% confidence interval (CI) (5%, 25%). Results are statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in COVID-19 death rate, with the magnitude of increase 20 times that observed for PM2.5 and all-cause mortality. The study results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis.","Wu, X.; Nethery, R.

439,A hybrid multi-scale model of COVID-19 transmission dynamics to assess the potential of non-pharmaceutical interventions,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has caused a global outbreak which represents a major threat to global health. Public health resorted to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and lockdown to slow down the spread of the pandemic. However, the effect of each of these measures remains hard to quantify. We design a multi-scale model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We describe the motion of individual agents using a social force model. Each agent can be either susceptible, infected, quarantined, immunized or deceased. The model considers both mechanisms of direct and indirect transmission. We parameterize the model to reproduce the early dynamics of disease spread in Italy. We show that panic situations increase the risk of infection transmission in crowds despite social distancing measures. Next, we suggest that pre-symptomatic transmission could be a significant driver of the infection spread. Then, we show that the restricted movement of the individuals flattens the epidemic curve. Finally, model predictions suggest that measures stricter than social distancing and lockdown were used to control the epidemic in Wuhan, China.","Bouchnita, A.; Jebrane, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054460v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054460v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
440,Explaining the Bomb-Like Dynamics of COVID-19 with Modeling and the Implications for Policy,"Using a Bayesian approach to epidemiological compartmental modeling, we demonstrate the bomb-like behavior of exponential growth in COVID-19 cases can be explained by transmission of asymptomatic and mild cases that are typically unreported at the beginning of pandemic events due to lower prevalence of testing. We studied the exponential phase of the pandemic in Italy, Spain, and South Korea, and found the R0 to be 2.56 (95% CrI, 2.41-2.71), 3.23 (95% CrI, 3.06-3.4), and 2.36 (95% CrI, 2.22-2.5) if we use Bayesian priors that assume a large portion of cases are not detected. Weaker priors regarding the detection rate resulted in R0 values of 9.22 (95% CrI, 9.01-9.43), 9.14 (95% CrI, 8.99-9.29), and 8.06 (95% CrI, 7.82-8.3) and assumes nearly 90% of infected patients are identified. Given the mounting evidence that potentially large fractions of the population are asymptomatic, the weaker priors that generate the high R0 values to fit the data required assumptions about the epidemiology of COVID-19 that do not fit with the biology, particularly regarding the timeframe that people remain infectious. Our results suggest that models of transmission assuming a relatively lower R0 value that do not consider a large number of asymptomatic cases can result in misunderstanding of the underlying dynamics, leading to poor policy decisions and outcomes.","Lin, G.; Strauss, A.

441,Validation of reported risk factors for disease classification and prognosis in COVID-19: a descriptive and retrospective study,"Risk indicators viral load (ORF1ab Ct), lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactic acid (LA) in COVID-19 patients have been proposed in recent studies. However, the predictive effects of those indicators on disease classification and prognosis remains largely unknown. We dynamically measured those reported indicators in 132 cases of COVID-19 patients including the moderate-cured (moderated and cured), severe-cured (severe and cured) and critically ill (died). Our data showed that CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, lactic acid and viral load could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients in different degrees. CRP, IL-6 and LYM% were more effective than other three factors in predicting prognosis. For disease classification, CRP and LYM% were sensitive in identifying the types between critically ill and severe (or moderate). Notably, among the investigated factors, LYM% was the only one that could distinguish between the severe and moderate types. Collectively, we concluded that LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable predictor for disease typing and prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the precise classification and prognosis prediction are critical for saving the insufficient medical resources, stratified treatment and improving the survival rate of critically ill patients. We recommend that LYM% be used independently or in combination with other indicators in the management of COVID-19.","Tan, L.; Kang, X.; Ji, X.; Wang, Q.; li, Y.; Wang, Q.; Miao, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053769v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053769v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
442,Longitudinal analysis of laboratory findings during the process of recovery for patients with COVID-19,"Objective To explore longitudinal change patterns of key laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19, and to identify independent prognostic factors by examining the associations between laboratory findings and outcomes of patients. Methods The multicenter study prospectively included 59 patients with COVID-19 treated at Jilin province from January 21, 2020 to May 5, 2020. Laboratory tests were included haematological, biochemical, and immunological tests. Results Laboratory findings, the characteristics of epidemiological and demographic data were extracted from electronic medical records. Eosinopenia was shown in 52.6% cases at onset, and the average value of eosinophil continued to significantly increase thereafter. Lymphopenia was found in 40.4% cases at onset, and the average value of lymphocyte was slowly elevated after day 5. Thrombocytopenia was shown in 12.3% cases at onset, and the average value of mean platelet volume was decreased sharply after day 7. The values of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, creatinine kinase-muscle/brain activity, and cardiac troponin I, serum cardiac markers, were beyond the upper limit of RI from 6.1% to 30.6% at onset. The abnormity of liver function tests, kidney function tests, electrolytes was 2.0%~59.2%, 2.0%~4.1%, 6.0%~30.0%, respectively. Eosinophil, platelet and carbondioxide combining power were selected as the prognostic factors. Conclusions The haematological, biochemical, and immunological tests were found significant abnormity at onset and longitudinal change patterns in the patients with COVID-19. Age, Eosinophil, PLT and CO2 may used to predict the recovery probability.

443,Portable and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19: Combined use of the miniPCR thermocycler and a well-plate reader for SARS-Co2 virus detection,"The COVID-19 pandemic has crudely demonstrated the value of massive and rapid diagnostics. By the first week of April, more than 900,000 positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, although this number could be greatly underestimated. In the case of an epidemic emergency, the first line of response should be based on commercially available and validated resources. Here, we demonstrate the combined use of the miniPCR, a commercial compact and portable PCR device recently available on the market, and a commercial well-plate reader as a diagnostic system for detecting SARS-CoV2 nucleic acids. We used the miniPCR to detect and amplify SARS-CoV2 DNA sequences using the sets of initiators recommended by the World Health Organization for targeting three different regions that encode for the N protein. Prior to amplification, samples were combined with a DNA intercalating reagent (i.e., EvaGreen Dye). Sample fluorescence after amplification was then read using a commercial 96-well plate reader. This straightforward method allows the detection and amplification of SARS-CoV2 nucleic acids in the range of ~625 to 2 x 105 DNA copies. The accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostics strategy may provide a cost-efficient and reliable alternative for COVID-19 pandemic testing, particularly in underdeveloped regions where RT-QPCR instrument availability may be limited. In addition, the portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of the miniPCR makes it a reliable alternative for deployment in point-of-care SARS-CoV2 detection efforts during pandemics.","Gonzalez-Gonzalez, E.; Trujillo-de Santiago, G.; Lara-Mayorga, I.

444,Investigating the likely association between genetic ancestry and COVID-19 manifestation,"The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown discernible variability across the globe. While in some countries people are recovering relatively quicker, in others, recovery times have been comparatively longer and numbers of those succumbing to it high. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the likely association between an individual's ancestry and the extent of COVID-19 manifestation employing Europeans as the case study. We employed 10,215 ancient and modern genomes across the globe assessing 597,573 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between various ancestry proportions of European genomes and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio was calculated and its significance was statistically evaluated. We found significant positive correlation (p=0.03) between European Mesolithic hunter gatherers (WHG) ancestral fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio and a marginally significant negative correlation (p=0.06) between Neolithic Iranian ancestry fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio. We further identified 404 immune response related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by comparing publicly available 753 genomes from various European countries against 838 genomes from various Eastern Asian countries in a genome wide association study (GWAS). Prominently we identified that SNPs associated with Interferon stimulated antiviral response, Interferon-stimulated gene 15 mediated antiviral mechanism and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthase mediated antiviral response show large differences in allele frequencies between Europeans and East Asians. Overall, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the likely association between genetic ancestry and COVID-19 manifestation. While our current findings improve our overall understanding of the COVID-19, we note that the development of effective therapeutics will benefit immensely from a more detailed analyses of individual genomic sequence data from COVID-19 patients of varied ancestries.","Das, R.; Ghate, S.

445,Indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"Background: By early April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected nearly one million people and had spread to nearly all countries worldwide. It is essential to understand where and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. Methods: Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural cities (municipalities) in China, not including Hubei province, between 4 January and 11 February 2020. We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and associated indoor environmental issues. Results: Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases. Conclusions: All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.","Qian, H.; Miao, T.; LIU, L.; Zheng, X.; Luo, D.; Li, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True

448,Estimating false-negative detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR,"Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are used to test patients and key workers for infection with the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus. RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives can occur if the sample contains insufficient quantities of the virus to be successfully amplified and detected. The amount of virus in a swab is likely to vary between patients, sample location (nasal, throat or sputum) and through time as infection progresses. Here, we analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. We identify that the probability of a positive test decreases with time after symptom onset, with throat samples less likely to yield a positive result relative to nasal samples. Empirically derived distributions of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation allowed us to comment on the likely false negative rates in cohorts of patients who present for testing at different clinical stages. We further estimate the expected numbers of false negative tests in a group of tested individuals and show how this is affected by the timing of the tests. Finally, we assessed the robustness of these estimates of false negative rates to the probability of false positive tests. This work has implications both for the identification of infected patients and for the discharge of convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.","Wikramaratna, P.; Paton, R.

We here investigated the geographical expansion of the infection and correlate it with the annual indexes of air quality observed from the Sentinel-5 satellite orbiting around China, Italy and the U.S.A. Controlling for population size, we find more viral infections in those areas afflicted by Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Higher mortality was also correlated with poor air quality, namely with high PM2.5, CO and NO2 values. In Italy, the correspondence between poor air quality and SARS-CoV-2 appearance and induced mortality was the starkest. Similar to smoking, people living in polluted areas are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections and induced mortality. This further suggests the detrimental impact of climate change on the prevention of epidemics.","Pansini, R.; Fornacca, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053595v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053595v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True

Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that suppress the epidemic and provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants that can be adapted in response to epidemiological observations, can in certain conditions suppress the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle reduces the reproduction number R by a combination of reduced exposure time and a resonance effect where those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing and extensive testing and contact tracing. Adaptive work-lockdown cycles can provide epidemic control and offer predictability to many economic sectors.","Karin, O.; Bar-On, Y.

452,Estimate of the development of the epidemic reproduction number Rt from Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 case data and implications for political measures based on prognostics,"The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV) has induced a world-wide pandemic and subsequent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in order to control the spreading of the virus. NPIs are considered to be critical in order to at least delay the peak number of infected individuals and to prevent the health care system becoming overwhelmed by the number of patients to treat in hospitals or in intensive care units (ICUs). However, there is also increasing concern that the NPIs in place would increase mortality because of other diseases, increase the frequency of suicide and increase the risk of an economic recession with unforeseeable implications. It is therefore instrumental to evaluate the necessity of NPIs and to monitor the progress of containment of the virus spreading. We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states. Based on an extended infection-epidemic model, parameterized with data from the Robert Koch-Institute and, alternatively, with parameters stemming from a fit to the initial phase of CoV spreading in different regions of Italy, we consistently found that the reproduction number was turned down to a range near 1 in all federal states. We used the latest reproduction number as a starting point for the simulation of epidemic progression and varied the reproduction number, mimicking either release or strengthening of NPIs. Germany is currently, April 3rd, 2020, at the border line of a reproduction number between the scenarios of major immunisation of the population or eradication of the virus. We strongly recommend to keep all NPIs in place and suggest to even strengthen the measures in order to accelerate reaching the state of full control, thus, also limiting collateral damage of the NPIs in time.","Khailaie, S.; Mitra, T.; Bandyopadhyay, A.; Schips, M.; Mascheroni, P.; Vanella, P.; Lange, B.; Binder, S.; Meyer-Hermann, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053637v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053637v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
453,A mechanistic population balance model to evaluate the impact of interventions on infectious disease outbreaks: Case for COVID19,"Infectious diseases, especially when new and highly contagious, could be devastating producing epidemic outbreaks and pandemics. Predicting the outcomes of such events in relation to possible interventions is crucial for societal and healthcare planning and forecasting of resource needs. Deterministic and mechanistic models can capture the main known phenomena of epidemics while also allowing for a meaningful interpretation of results. In this work a deterministic mechanistic population balance model was developed. The model describes individuals in a population by infection stage and age group. The population is treated as in a close well mixed community with no migrations. Infection rates and clinical and epidemiological information govern the transitions between stages of the disease. The present model provides a steppingstone to build upon and its current low complexity retains accessibility to non experts and policy makers to comprehend the variables and phenomena at play. The impact of specific interventions on the outbreak time course, number of cases and outcome of fatalities were evaluated including that of available critical care. Data available from the COVID19 outbreak as of early April 2020 was used. Key findings in our results indicate that (i) universal social isolation measures appear effective in reducing total fatalities only if they are strict and the number of daily social interactions is reduced to very low numbers; (ii) selective isolation of only the elderly (at higher fatality risk) appears almost as effective in reducing total fatalities but at a much lower economic damage; (iii) an increase in the number of critical care beds could save up to eight lives per extra bed in a million population with the current parameters used; (iv) the use of protective equipment (PPE) appears effective to dramatically reduce total fatalities when implemented extensively and in a high degree; (v) infection recognition through random testing of the population, accompanied by subsequent (self) isolation of infected aware individuals, can dramatically reduce the total fatalities but only if conducted extensively to almost the entire population and sustained over time; (vi) ending isolation measures while R0 values remain above 1.0 (with a safety factor) renders the isolation measures useless and total fatality numbers return to values as if nothing was ever done; (vii) ending the isolation measures for only the population under 60 y/o at R0 values still above 1.0 increases total fatalities but only around half as much as if isolation ends for everyone; (viii) a threshold value, equivalent to that for R0, appears to exist for the daily fatality rate at which to end isolation measures, this is significant as the fatality rate is (unlike R0) very accurately known. Any interpretation of these results for the COVID19 outbreak predictions and interventions should be considered only qualitatively at this stage due to the low confidence (lack of complete and valid data) on the parameter values available at the time of writing. Any quantitative interpretation of the results must be accompanied with a critical discussion in terms of the model limitations and its frame of application.","Rodriguez, J.; Acuna, J.

Meanwhile, increased testing capacity (facilitating early identification of infected people and quick isolation) and strict social-distancing and self-quarantine rules are effective in abating the outbreak. The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days. This model could be used to determine resources needed before safely lifting state policies on social distancing.","Chen, S.; Li, Q.; Gao, S.; Kang, Y.; Shi, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052720v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052720v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
455,Plasma Metabolomic and Lipidomic Alterations Associated with COVID-19,"The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health crisis. COVID-19 is marked by its rapid progression from mild to severe conditions, particularly in the absence of adequate medical care. However, the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected patient metabolism. Moreover, many of the metabolite and lipid alterations, particularly ones associated with hepatic functions, have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19. This work provides valuable knowledge about blood biomarkers associated with COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets, and presents important resource for further studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Wu, D.; Shu, T.; Yang, X.; Song, J.-X.; Zhang, M.; Wen, L.; Huang, M.; Yu, Y.; Yang, Q.; Zhu, T.; Xu, J.; Mu, J.; Wang, Y.; Wang, H.; Tang, T.; Ren, Y.; Wu, Y.; Qiu, Y.; Zhang, D.-Y.; Shang, Y.; Zhou, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053819v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053819v1?rss=1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,,True
456,Acute liver injury and its association with death risk of patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based prospective case-cohort study,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with multiple organ injuries. The aim of this study was to analyze SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver injury (ALI), its association with death risk and prognosis after discharge. Methods: Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients were recruited. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. ALI was evaluated and its prognosis was tracked. The association between ALI and death risk was analyzed. Results: Of 355 COVID-19 patients, 211 were common, 88 severe, and 51 critical ill cases, respectively. On admission, 223 (62.8%) patients were with hypoproteinemia, 151(42.5%) with cholestasis, and 101 (28.5%) with hepatocellular injury. As expected, ALI was more common in critical ill patients. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and lymphocyte reduction were three important independent risk factors predicting ALI among COVID-19 patients. Death risk analysis shows that fatality rate was higher among patients with hypoproteinemia than those without hypoproteinemia (RR=9.471, P<0.001). Moreover, fatality rate was higher among patients with cholestasis than those without cholestasis (RR=2.182, P<0.05). Follow-up observation found that more than one hepatic functional indexes of two-third patients remained abnormal 14 days after discharge. Conclusions: ALI at early stage elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI has not recovered completely 14 days after discharge.","Fu, L.; Fei, J.; Xu, S.; Xiang, H.-X.; Xiang, Y.; Tan, Z.-X.; Li, M.-D.; Liu, F.-F.; Li, Y.; Han, M.-F.; Li, X.-Y.; Zhao, H.; Xu, D.-X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050997v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050997v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
457,Assessment of Specimen Pooling to Conserve SARS CoV-2 Testing Resources,"Importance The United States is experiencing an acute shortage of reagents important for performance of assays for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 in clinical specimens. Objective To determine whether saving in reagents for detection of SARS CoV-2 can be accomplished using the optimal parameters for group testing of pooled specimens in a public health laboratory. Design The most efficient specimen pool size was determined using a web-based application. Parameters affecting the optimal pool size of 5 specimens were: prevalence rate of 5%, a lower limit of detection of 1 to 3 RNA copies per microliter, sensitivity and specificity of 100%, two-stage pooling algorithm, and a range of pool sizes of 3 to 10 samples. Experimental pools were created using 50 microliter from each confirmed nasopharyngeal positive patient specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 microliter each) for a total volume of 250 microliter. Viral RNA was then extracted from each pool and subsequently tested with the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay that was developed by the CDC and used according to the instructions of manufacturer. Setting Studies were conducted in the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory with samples collected from individual patients throughout the state. Participants A total of 21 SARS CoV-2 confirmed positive samples and 84 SARS CoV-2 confirmed negative samples were used to create 21 pools. The positive specimens were selected for Ct values indicating a relatively low amount of viral RNA. The method was then tested on an unselected group of 60 community nasopharyngeal specimens. Results Following extraction and RT-PCR amplification, all 21 pools were characterized as SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected with Ct values within -1 and 5 Ct of the original samples. The analysis of 60 community specimens, grouped in 12-pools, determined that two pools were positive followed by identification of two detected specimens among the 60 tested. This was accomplished with a total of 22 reactions. Conclusion and Relevance Group testing may result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69% when the positive laboratory test rate is 10% or less.","Abdalhamid, B.; Bilder, C.

458,Estimation of the probability of reinfection with COVID-19 coronavirus by the SEIRUS model,"With sensitivity of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used to detect the presence of the virus in the human host, the global health community has been able to record a great number of recovered population. Therefore, in a bid to answer a burning question of reinfection in the recovered class, the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (E_0 ) state for COVID-19 coronavirus was developed in this study and was discovered to both exist as well as satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number R_0=0 for and endemic situation. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, B=0. Furthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally. Result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.","Victor, A.

459,Case fatality rate in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Estimating the prevalence of severe or critical illness and case fatality of COVID-19 outbreak in December, 2019 remains a challenge due to biases associated with surveillance, data synthesis and reporting. We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-regression. Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk factors. Results: The meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were 15%, 5% and 0.8% respectively. Adjusting for potential underreporting and publication bias, increased these estimates to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. Increasing age and elevated LDH consistently predicted severe / critical disease and case fatality. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at presentation; and elevated CRP predicted increased severity. Conclusions: Risk factors that emerged in our analyses predicting severity and case fatality should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk. Estimated case fatality rate of 7.4% after correcting for publication bias underscores the importance of strict adherence to preventive measures, case detection, surveillance and reporting.","Kahathuduwa, C.

460,Reduction of lymphocyte at early stage elevates severity and death risk of COVID-19 patients: a hospital-based case-cohort study,"Background and objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been pandemic worldwide. Several reports observed a reduction of lymphocytes among COVID-19 patients. However, clinical significance of lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between lymphocyte reduction at early stage and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: All 192 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Electronic medical records, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities and exposure history, were collected. Biochemical indexes on admission and chest computed tomography (CT) were detected. Patient's prognosis was followed up. Results: On admission, 84 (43.8%) patients suffered from lymphocyte reduction among COVID-19 patients. The count and percentage of lymphocytes on admission were lower among more than seventy-year-old patients than those of younger patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that older age was a risk factor of lymphocyte reduction. Of interest, chest CT score, a key marker of lung injury, was increased among COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. By contrast, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygenation index, several respiratory function markers, were decreased in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Moreover, TBIL and DBIL, two markers of hepatic injury, creatinine and urea nitrogen, two indices of renal function, and creatine kinase, AST and LDH, three myocardial enzymes, were elevated in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction. Among 84 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction, 32.1% died. Fatality rate was obviously higher in COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte reduction than those with normal lymphocyte (RR=5.789, P<0.001). Conclusion: Older COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to lymphocyte reduction. Lymphocyte reduction at early stage aggravates the severity of multiple organ injuries and elevates death risk of COVID-19 patients.","Fei, J.; Fu, L.; Li, Y.; Xiang, H.-X.; Xiang, Y.; Li, M.-D.; Liu, F.-F.; Xu, D.-x.; Zhao, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050955v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050955v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
461,Dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics: SEIR models underestimate peak infection rates and overestimateepidemic duration,"Compartment models of infectious diseases, such as SEIR, are being used extensively to model the COVID-19 epidemic. Transitions between compartments are modelled either as instantaneous rates in differential equations, or as transition probabilities in discrete time difference or matrix equations. These models give accurate estimates of the position of equilibrium points, when the rate at which individuals enter each stage is equal to the rate at which they exit from it. However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of times that an individual spends in each compartment, so do not accurately capture the transient dynamics of epidemics. Here we show how matrix models can provide a straightforward route to accurately model stage durations, and thus correctly reproduce epidemic dynamics. We apply this approach to modelling the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic. We show that a SEIR model underestimates peak infection rates (by a factor of three using published parameter estimates based on the progress of the epidemic in Wuhan) and substantially overestimates epidemic persistence after the peak has passed.","Grant, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050674v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050674v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
462,Inflow restrictions can prevent epidemics when contact tracing efforts are effective but have limited capacity,"When a region tries to prevent an outbreak of an epidemic, like that of COVID-19, two broad strategies are initially available: limiting the inflow of infected cases using travel restrictions and quarantines, and reducing transmissions from inflowing cases using contact tracing and community interventions. A large number of papers have used epidemiological models to argue that inflow restrictions are unlikely to be effective. We conduct a mathematical analysis using a simple epidemiological model and perform simulations that show this conclusion can change if we relax the assumption of unlimited capacity in containment efforts such as contact tracing. In particular, when contact tracing is effective, but the system is close to being overwhelmed, moderate travel restrictions can have very large effects on the probability of an epidemic.","Malmberg, H.; Britton, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
463,"The effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 cases, deaths and demand for hospital services in the UK: a modelling study","Background Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK. Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been critical to support evidence-based policymaking during the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, including the introduction of school closures, social distancing, shielding of elderly groups, self-isolation of symptomatic cases, and extreme ""lockdown""-type restrictions. We simulated different durations of interventions and triggers for introduction, as well as combinations of interventions. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (intensive care unit, ICU) treatment, and deaths. Findings We found that mitigation measures aimed at reducing transmission would likely have decreased the reproduction number, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding NHS availability. To keep ICU bed demand below capacity in the model, more extreme restrictions were necessary. In a scenario where ""lockdown""-type interventions were put in place to reduce transmission, these interventions would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year in order to prevent healthcare demand exceeding availability. Interpretation The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are likely required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs.","Davies, N.

465,A Model for Supply-Chain Decisions for Resource Sharing with an Application to Ventilator Allocation to Combat COVID-19,"This paper presents a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory from a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (FEMA) to different states in the US. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In an extreme case, where the demand is assumed to be concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 28,500 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 2,700 ventilators on 04/12/20. The results also suggest that in the worse-than-average to severe demand scenario cases, NY requires between 7,600-9,200 additional ventilators for COVID-19 patients during its peak demand. However, between 400 to 2,000 of these ventilators can be given to a different state after the peak demand in NY has subsided.","Mehrotra, S.; Rahimian, H.; Barah, M.; Luo, F.; Schantz, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051078v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051078v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
466,Capacities and predicted demands of Brazil's health system in view of the novel coronavirus disease outbreak,"The aim of this work is to estimate capacities of Brazil's health system and their demand as a result of predicted incoming severe cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. Three incrementing levels of hospital equipment usage are considered: (1) in terms of available intensive care unit (ICU) beds; (2) available ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms; and (3) available ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and respirators located in other hospital areas. The average available (adult) ICU beds in a hospital has been computed deducting from the number of existing beds the equivalent number of beds that has been demanded during 2019 on a monthly average. Based on a reference mean duration of hospitalization for the disease, it is computed the daily admission capacity of infected patients per state and of the entire country health system for each of the three referred levels of hospital equipment usage. Furthermore, an exponential regression model is fitted using the daily available data for the number of patients who have been documented as infected in Brazil. It can then be predicted the three dates at which the health system might begin to demonstrate stress for the maximum demand of the three incrementing groups of hospital equipments. The necessary public data are analyzed by means of the Python programming language and are made available on the internet by the Department of Health Informatics of Brazil (DATASUS - Departamento de Informatica do Sistema Unico de Saude) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE - Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica).","Cavalcante, E.

Methods: To evaluate feasibility we nebulized ultraviolet sensitive detergents into the artificial airway of a resuscitation dummy and performed CPR. The spread of the visualized aerosol was documented by a camera. In a second approach we applied nebulized detergents into human cadavers by an endotracheal tube and detected aerosol- spread during chest compressions the same way. We did recordings with undergoing compression- only-CPR, with a surgical mask and with an inserted laryngeal tube with and without a connected airway filter. Results: Most aerosol-spread at the direction of the provider was visualized during compression-only-CPR. The use of a surgical mask deflected the spread. Inserting a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter lead to a remarkable reduction of aerosol-spread. Conclusion: The early insertion of a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter before starting chest compression may be good for two Things: the treatment of hypoxemia as the likeliest cause of cardiac arrest and for staff protection during CPR.","Ott, M.; Milazzo, A.; Liebau, S.; Wagner, A.; Jaki, C.; Schilling, T.; Krohn, A.; Heymer, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049197v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049197v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
468,No indications for overt innate immune suppression in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"At the end of March 2020, there were in excess of 800.000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. Several reports suggest that, in severe cases, COVID-19 may cause a hyperinflammatory 'cytokine storm'. However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infection, which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. We explored kinetics of mHLA-DR expression, the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients, in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Twenty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, of which 75% was male and 79% had comorbidities. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited large high levels of inflammatory parameters such as CRP and PCT. mHLA-DR expression levels were mostly within the normal range of 15000 - 45000 mAb/cell and showed no change over time. COVID-19 patients displayed notably higher mHLA-DR expression levels compared with bacterial septic shock patients. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection. In conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response, mHLA-DR expression kinetics indicate no overt innate immune suppression in COVID-19 patients. These data signify that innate immune suppression as a negative feedback mechanism following PAMP-induced inflammation appears not to be present in COVID-19.","Kox, M.; Frenzel, T.; Schouten, J.; van de Veerdonk, F.; Koenen, H.

470,Optimal COVID-19 epidemic control until vaccine deployment,"Since Dec 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic has spread over the globe creating one of the greatest pandemics ever witnessed. This epidemic wave will only begin to roll back once a critical proportion of the population is immunised, either by mounting natural immunity following infection, or by vaccination. The latter option can minimise the cost in terms of human lives but it requires to wait until a safe and efficient vaccine is developed, a period estimated to last at least 18 months. In this work, we use optimal control theory to explore the best strategy to implement while waiting for the vaccine. We seek a solution minimizing deaths and costs due to the implementation of the control strategy itself. We find that such a solution leads to an increasing level of control with a maximum reached near the fourth month of the epidemics and a steady decrease until vaccine deployment. This strategy strongly outperforms others with constant or cycling allocations of the same amount of resources to control the outbreak.

471,Monitoring Italian COVID-19 spread by an adaptive SEIRD model,"Due to the recent diffusion of COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is making efforts in analysing models for understanding the present situation and predicting future scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) differential model [Weitz J. S. and Dushoff J., Scientific reports, 2015] for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from February 24th 2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time-dependent function (SEIRD(rm)). Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter. Moreover, the increased flexibility in the choice of the infection rate function makes it possible to better control the predictions due to the lockdown policy.","Loli Piccolomiini, E.; Zama, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20049734v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20049734v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
472,The impacts of diagnostic capability and prevention measures on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan,"Background: Although the rapidly rising transmission trend of COVID-19 in Wuhan has been controlled in late February 2020, the outbreak still caused a global pandemic afterward. Understanding Wuhan COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effects of prevention approaches is of significant importance for containing virus global transmission. However, most of the recent studies focused on the early outbreaks without considering improvements in diagnostic capability and effects of prevention measures together, thus the estimated results may only reflect the facts in a given period of time. Methods: We constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, embedding with latent periods under different prevention measures and proportions of documented infections to characterize the Wuhan COVID-19 transmission cross different stages of the outbreak. The epidemiological parameters were estimated using a particle filtering approach. Results: Our model successfully reproduced the dynamics of the Wuhan local epidemic with two peaks on February 4 and February 12 separately. Prevention measures determined the time of reaching the first peak and caused an 87% drop in the R_t from 3.09 (95% CI, 2.10 to 3.63) to 0.41 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.66). An improved diagnostic capability created the second peak and increased the number of documented infections. The proportion of documented infections changed from 23% (95% CI, 20% to 26%) to 37% (95% CI, 33% to 41%) when the detection kits were released after January 26, and later up to 73% (95% CI, 64% to 80%) after the diagnostic criteria were improved.","LIANG, J.; Yuan, H.-Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049387v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049387v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
473,Public perspectives on social distancing and other protective measures in Europe: a cross-sectional survey study during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objectives: The extent to which people implement government-issued protective measures is critical in preventing further spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our study aimed to evaluate the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of these measures in daily life, and to identify communication channels used to acquire relevant information on COVID-19 in European countries. Design: A cross-sectional online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated on social media starting March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we compiled and categorized community containment measures enacted in each country by stringency (stage I-IV). Response collection continued for one week to explore possible dynamics as containment strategies intensified. Participants: In total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). An additional 1,365 respondents completed the survey in the following week. Results: Participants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands were less likely to consider a complete social lockdown effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents did not only apply enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%), but also self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents largely reported being sufficiently informed about the COVID-19 outbreak and about behaviors to avoid infection (range across countries: 90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most commonly reported included television (range: 53.0%-82.0%), newspapers (range: 31.0%-63.0%), official health websites (range: 39.0%-54.1%), and social media (range: 40.0%-55.8%). We observed no major changes in answers over time. Conclusions: In European countries, the degree of public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures was high and residents reported to be sufficiently informed by various communication channels. In March 2020, implementation of enacted and self-initiated measures differed between countries and were highest among Italian respondents, who were subjected to the most elaborate measures of social lockdown and greatest COVID-19 burden in Europe.","Meier, K.; Glatz, T.; Guijt, M.

We further show that in the absence of detailed knowledge of the time delay distribution of (a), the true case mortality rate is obtained by pursuing method (b) at the end of the outbreak when the fate of every case has decisively been rendered. The approach is then employed to calculate the mean case mortality rate of 13 regions of China where every case has already been resolved. This leads to a mean rate of 0.527 +/- 0.001 %.","Lieu, R.; Quenby, S.; Jiang, A.

The simulation, not only captures the model dynamic of the spread of the virus, but also, takes care of population and mobility data. The model is calibrated based on epidemic data and events specifically of Sultanate of Oman, which can easily be generalized. The simulation results are quite disturbing, indicating that, during a process of stringent social distancing and testing strategies, a small perturbation can lead to quite undesirable outcomes. The simulation results, although consistent in expected outcomes across changing parameters' values, also indicate a substantial mismatch with real numbers. An analysis of what can be the reason of this mismatch is also performed. Within these contradictions, for Oman, regarding the eradication of epidemic, the future is not extremely alarming.","Zia, K.; Farooq, U.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050666v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050666v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
477,Explaining national differences in the mortality of Covid-19: individual patient simulation model to investigate the effects of testing policy and other factors on apparent mortality.,"There has been extensive speculation on the apparent differences in mortality between countries reporting on the confirmed cases and deaths due to Covid-19. A number of explanations have been suggested, but there is no clear evidence about how apparent fatality rates may be expected to vary with the different testing regimes, admission policies and other variables. An individual patient simulation model was developed to address this question. Parameters and sensitivity analysis based upon recent international data sources for Covid-19 and results were averaged over 100 iterations for a simulated cohort of over 500,000 patients. Different testing regimes for Covid-19 were considered; testing admitted patients only, various rates of community testing of symptomatic cases and active contact-tracing and screening. In the base case analysis, apparent mortality ranged from 10.5% under a policy of testing only admitted patients to 0.4% with intensive contact tracing and community testing. These findings were sensitive to assumptions regarding admission rates and the rate of spread, with more selective admission policies and suppression of spread increasing the apparent mortality and the potential for apparent mortality rates to exceed 18% under some circumstances. Under all scenarios the proportion of patients tested in the community had the greatest impact on apparent mortality. Whilst differences in mortality due to health service and demographic factors cannot be excluded, the current international differences in reported mortality are all consistent with differences in practice regarding screening, community testing and admission policies.","Michaels, J.

478,Inferring COVID-19 spreading rates and potential change points for case number forecasts,"As COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the globe, short-term modeling forecasts provide time-critical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies. A main challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change as first governmental intervention measures are showing an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. For the case of COVID-19 spreading in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate which correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions.Thereby, we can (a) quantify the effects of recent governmental measures to mitigating the disease spread, and (b) incorporate analogue change points to forecast future scenarios and case numbers.Our code is freely available and can be readily adapted to any country or region.","Dehning, J.; Zierenberg, J.; Spitzner, F.

479,Exponential phase of covid19 expansion is not driven by climate at global scale,"The pandemic state of COVID-19 caused by the SARS CoV-2 put the world in quarantine and is causing an unprecedented economic crisis. However, COVID-19 is spreading in different rates at different countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic, climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID-19. We found that global connections, represented by countries importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics did not affect this big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize almost every corner on Earth. Based on our global analysis, the global network of air transportation could lead to a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic if board control measures in international airports were not taken and are not sustained during this pandemic. Despite all limitations of a global analysis, our results indicate that the current claims that the growth rate of COVID-19 may be lower in tropical countries should be taken very carefully, at risk to disturb well-established and effective policy of social isolation that may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to collapse of national health systems. This is the case of Brazil, a well-connected tropical country that presents the second highest increase rate of COVID-19 and might experience a serious case of human-induced disasters if decision makers take into consideration unsupported claims of the growth rate of COVID-19 might be lower in tropical countries.","Coelho, M.

480,Therapeutic Management of COVID-19 Patients: A systematic review,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the COVID-19 that has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO in 2020. The COVID-19 treatment guidelines vary in each country, and yet there is no approved therapeutic for COVID-19. Aims of the study: this review aimed to report any evidence of therapeutics used for the management of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice since the emergence of the virus. Methods: A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA Statement. Articles for review were selected from electronic databases (Embase, Medline and Google Scholar). Readily accessible peer-reviewed full articles in English published from December 1 st , 2019 to March 26 th , 2020 were included. The search terms included combinations of: COVID, SARS-COV-2, glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, antiviral, antibacterial. There were no restrictions on the type of study design eligible for inclusion. Results: As of March 26, 2020, of the initial manuscripts identified (n=449) articles. Forty-one studies were included, of which clinical trials (n=3), (case reports n=7), case series (n=10), retrospective (n=11) and prospective (n=10) observational studies. Thirty-six studies were conducted in China (88%). The most common mentioned and reported medicine in this systematic review was corticosteroids (n=25), followed by Lopinavir (n=21) and oseltamivir (n=16). Conclusions: This is the first systematic review up to date related to the therapeutics used in COVID-19 patients.

481,"Patient-collected tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate swabs for SARS-CoV-2 yield equivalent sensitivity to health care worker collected nasopharyngeal swabs","Background: Current testing for SARS-CoV-2 requires health care workers to collect a nasopharyngeal (NP) sample from a patient. NP sampling requires the use of personal protective equipment that are in limited supply, is uncomfortable for the patient, and reduces clinical efficiency. This study explored the equivalency of patient-collected tongue, anterior nares (nasal), and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to health care worker-collected NP samples for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients presenting to five urgent care facilities with symptoms indicative of an upper respiratory infection provided self-collected samples from three anatomic sites along with a health care worker-collected NP sample. Using NP as the comparator, sensitivities and one-sided 95% confidence intervals for the tongue, nasal, and MT samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were calculated. Results: The sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient-collected tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate samples was 89.8% (95% CI: 80.2 -100.0), 94.0 (95% CI: 84.6-100.0) and 96.2 (95% CI: 87.7-100.0), respectively. Among samples yielding positive results, cycle threshold (Ct) values (a measure of viral load) had correlation coefficients of 0.48, 0.78, and 0.86 between the NP samples and the tongue, nasal, and MT samples, respectively. Conclusions: Patient-collected nasal and MT samples demonstrated high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection using health care worker-collected NP samples as the comparator. Among patients testing positive with NP samples, nasal and MT Ct values demonstrated high correlations with those Ct values of the NP samples. Patient-collected nasal or MT sampling may improve efficiency for COVID-19 testing while reducing the risk of exposure of the health workforce.","Tu, Y.-P.; Jennings, R.; Hart, B.; Cangelosi, G.; Wood, R.; Wehber, K.; Verma, P.; Vojta, D.; Berke, E.

I then modify a standard SEIR model to model current growth patterns and detection rates in South Korea and New York state. Although reducing transmission rates have the largest impact, increasing TP rates by ~10% in New York can have an impact equal to adding tens of thousands of new tests per day. Increasing both TP rates and tests per day together can have significant impacts and likely be more easily sustained than social distancing restrictions. Systematic and standardized data collection, even beyond contact tracking, should be ongoing and quickly made available for research teams to maximize the efficacy of testing.","Rodriguez, P.

Preliminary results.","Introduction: Since the beginning of the outbreak in China, ending 2019, the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread subsequently to the rest of the world causing an on-going pandemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19: a public health emergency of international concern. Having into consideration the lockdown and quarantine situation, we decided to do evaluate the current emotional state on the general population with a web-based survey in English and in Spanish, which was considered a useful and fast method that could help us determine how people perceived stress and worry due to the COVID-19. Methods: The survey included a 22 items, gathering information in 3 sections: Sociodemographic data, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) by Cohen and additional queries that assessed the current worry and change of behaviours due to this pandemic. Results: The survey received 891 respondents from 25 countries, from March 17 to 23rd, 2020. The mean age of the respondents was 43.8 (14.2) years old, and more than two thirds were women. 12.8% were health personnel.The mean of the PSS-10 score was 17.4 (6.4). Significantly higher scores were observed among women, youth, students, and among those who expressed concern and those who perceived increased susceptibility to the COVID-19. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the health professionals and the general population. A good correlation was observed between mean relative volume (RSV) of the las 14 days and the number of cases reported (rho = 0.68, p <0.001) and deaths (rho = 0.51, p <0.001). Discussion: With these results we describe an increase of affective symptoms due to the COVID-19. This pandemic is raising the anxiety levels. The findings of our study show the affective and cognitive alterations people are going through.

485,Separate Fever Clinics Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 and Offload Emergency Resources: Analysis from a large tertiary hospital in China,"Objectives: COVID-19 began spreading widely in China in January 2020. Outpatient Fever Clinics (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were upgraded to provide COVID-19 screening and prevention attached to large tertiary hospitals. We sought to analyze the effect of upgraded FCs to detecting COVID-19 at our institution. Design: A population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 6,365 patients were screened in the FC. Methods: The FC of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) was upgraded on January 20, 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between December 12, 2019 to February 29, 2020, covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed. Results: 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001]. For critically-ill patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p< 0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critical-care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38 after (p<0.050). Nineteen COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or medical care providers were cross-infected. Conclusion: The work-load of the FC increased after the COVID-19 outbreak and effectively prevented COVID-19 from spreading in the hospital as well as offload ED resources.","Wang, J.; Zong, L.; Zhang, J.; Sun, H.; Joseph, W.

487,Sustainable social distancing through facemask use and testing during the Covid-19 pandemic,"We investigate how individual protective behaviors, different levels of testing, and isolation influence the transmission and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on an SEIR-type model incorporating asymptomatic but infectious individuals (40%), we show that the pandemic may be readily controllable through a combination of testing, treatment if necessary, and self-isolation after testing positive (TTI) of symptomatic individuals together with social protection (e.g., facemask use, handwashing). When the basic reproduction number, R0, is 2.4, 65% effective social protection alone (35% of the unprotected transmission) brings the R below 1. Alternatively, 20% effective social protection brings the reproduction number below 1.0 so long as 75% of the symptomatic population is covered by TTI within 12 hours of symptom onset. Even with 20% effective social protection, TTI of 1 in 4 symptomatic individuals can substantially 'flatten the curve' cutting the peak daily incidence in half.","Chowell, G.; Chowell, D.; Roosa, K.; Dhillon, R.; Srikrishna, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049981v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049981v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
488,Pre-outbreak determinants of perceived risks of corona infection and preventive measures taken. A prospective population-based study,"Objectives. Assess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which (pre-outbreak) factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as (pre-outbreak) respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital status and education level. Methods. Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample=3,540). Results. About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratios [aOR] smaller than .058). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.27-1.69). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.46-0.69). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR=2.89, 95% CI=2.24-3.73), heart problems (aOR=2.17, 95% CI=1.49-3.16) and diabetes (aOR=3.10, 95% CI=2.02-4.74) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. Conclusions. Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, men and those with lower education levels.","van der Velden, P.

489,Modeling risk of infectious diseases: a case of Coronavirus outbreak in four countries,"Background The novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) outbreak has been a serious concern around the globe. Since people are in tremor due to the massive spread of Coronavirus in the major parts of the world, it requires to predict the risk of this infectious disease. In this situation, we develop a model to measure the risk of infectious disease and predict the risk of 2019-nCOV transmission by using data of four countries - United States, Australia, Canada and China. Methods The model underlies that higher the population density, higher the risk of transmission of infectious disease from human to human. Besides, population size, case identification rate and travel of infected passengers in different regions are also incorporated in this model. Results According to the calculated risk index, our study identifies New York State in United States (US) to be the most vulnerable area affected by the novel Coronavirus. Besides, other areas (province/state/territory) such as Hubei (China, 2nd), Massachusetts (US, 3rd), District of Columbia (US, 4th), New Jersey (US, 5th), Quebec (Canada, 20th), Australian Capital Territory (Australia, 29th) are also found as the most risky areas in US, China, Australia and Canada. Conclusion The study suggests avoiding any kind of mass gathering, maintaining recommended physical distances and restricting inbound and outbound flights of highly risk prone areas for tackling 2019-nCOV transmission.","Islam, M.

490,Dynamic Estimation of Epidemiological Parameters of COVID-19 Outbreak and Effects of Interventions on Its Spread,"A key challenge for estimating the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is the discrepancy between the officially reported number of infections and the true number of infections. A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from Wuhan to infer the true number in the city. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. Here, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers. Using the method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the disease had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020. Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11,239 [95% CI 4,794--22,372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,526--265,113], respectively. The effective reproduction number attained its maximum on January 24 (3.42 [95% CI 3.34--3.50]) and became less than 1 from February 7 (0.76 [95% CI 0.65--0.92]). We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan. In particular, transportation suspension and large scale hospitalization respectively prevented 33,719 and 90,072 people from getting infected in the nine-day time period right after its implementation.","Zhang, H.; Zhao, X.; Yin, K.; Yan, Y.; Qian, W.; Chen, B.; Fang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050310v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050310v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
491,Confronting COVID-19: Surging critical care capacity in Italy,"The current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe threats Italian capacity and that of other national health systems to effectively respond to the needs of patients who require intensive care, mostly due to pneumonia and derived complications from concomitant disease and age. Predicting the surge in capacity has proved difficult due to the requirement of a subtle combination of diverse expertise and difficult choices to be made on selecting robust measures of critical care utilization, and parsimonious epidemic modelling which account for changing government measures. We modelled the required surge capacity of ICU beds in Italy exclusively for COVID-19 patients at epidemic peak. Because new measures were imposed by the Italian government, suspending nearly all non-essential sectors of the economy, we included the potential impacts of these new measures. The modelling considered those hospitalized and home isolated as quarantined, mimicking conditions on the ground. The percentage of patients in intensive care (out of the daily active confirmed cases) required for our calculations were chosen based on clinical relevance and robustness, and this number was consistently on average 9.9% from February 24 to March 6, 2020. Five different scenarios were produced (two positive and three negative). Under most positive scenarios, in which R0 is reduced below 1 (i.e., 0.71), the number of daily active confirmed cases will peak at nearly 89 000 by the early days of April and the total number of intensive care beds exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients required in Italy estimated at 8791. Worst scenarios produce unmanageable numbers. Our results suggest that the decisive moment for Italy has come. Jointly reinforcement by the government of the measures approved so far, including home confinement, but even more important the full commitment of the civil society in respecting home confinement, social distancing and hygiene will be key in the next days. Yet, even under the best circumstances, intensive care capacity will need to get closer to 9000 units in the country to avoid preventable mortality. So far, only strong measures were effective in Italy, as shown by our modelling, and this may offer an opportunity to European countries to accelerate their interventions.","Rodriguez Llanes, J.

492,Estimation of the Final Size of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Pakistan,"The COVID-19 infections in Pakistan are spreading at an exponential rate and a point may soon be reached where rigorous prevention measures would need to be adopted. Mathematical models can help define the scale of an epidemic and the rate at which an infection can spread in a community. We used an SIR model to predict the magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan and compared the numbers with the reported cases on the national database. Our results indicate that Pakistan could hit peak number of infectious cases on May 26th, 2020 and by June 24th, 2020, 90% of the population will have become infected with the virus if policy interventions seeking to curb this infection are not adopted aggressively.","Syed, F.; Sibgatullah, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050369v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050369v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
493,Flattening the curve before it flattens us: hospital critical care capacity limits and mortality from novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) cases in US counties,"ABSTRACT Background As of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) of any country in the world. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response across all US counties. Methods Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system critical care supply were calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were statistically summarized and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates of COVID-19 infections and patients needing critical care were calculated from March 24, 2020 to April 24, 2020 for three different estimated population levels - 0%, 25%, and 50% - of contact reduction (through actions such as social distancing). Multiple national public and private datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate county-level critical care bed counts that included currently available beds and those that could be made available under four surge response scenarios - very low, low, medium, and high - as well as excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care. Results Surge response scenarios ranged from a very low total supply 77,588 critical care beds to a high total of 278,850 critical care beds. Over the four week study period, excess deaths from inaccessible critical care ranged from 24,688 in the very low response scenario to 13,268 in the high response scenario. Northeastern and urban counties were projected to be most affected by excess deaths due to critical care shortages, and counties in New York, Colorado, and Virginia were projected to exceed their critical care bed limits despite high levels of COVID-19 contact reduction. Over the four week study period, an estimated 12,203-19,594 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through greater preventive actions such as travel restrictions, publicly imposed contact precautions, greater availability of rapid testing for COVID-19, social distancing, self-isolation when sick, and similar interventions. An estimated 4,029-11,420 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations, including high clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like using a single ventilator for multiple patients. Conclusions Unless the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases is flattened over an extended period of time, the US COVID-19 epidemic will cause a shortage of critical care beds and drive up otherwise preventable deaths. The findings here support value of preventive actions to flatten the epidemic curve, as well as the value of exercising extraordinary surge capacity measures to increase access to hospital critical care for severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Branas, C.

494,"Global epidemiology, pathogenesis, immune response, diagnosis, treatment, economic and psychological impact, challenges, and future prevention of COVID-19: A scoping review","Background: Globally, the novel coronavirus, is a public health problem causing respiratory infections. Since the outbreak of severe acute and Middle East respiratory syndromes coronavirus was not reported to cause human infections. Now, it become an epidemic proportion with growing number of cases and deaths. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework. In this scoping review, 50 records published before 28 March, 2020 were included and discussed to better understand the current epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunological response, diagnosis, evasion mechanisms and suggested strategies to boost the immune system, challenges, treatment, and future preventions of the virus. PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, Global Health and google scholars were searched comprehensively for articles, preprints, grey literatures, reports, websites, conference proceedings and expert information. Studies conducted in human and published in the English language were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements of the review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in citations. Results: We identified 360 records, of which 50 studies met the inclusion criteria. We synthesized the data from the included records and dig out the deep insights of them and pooled into this review. The burden of the outbreak is worsening due to overcrowding, presence of asymptomatic carriers, scarcity of test kits, the immune escaping ability of the virus and lack of awareness. Conclusions and recommendations: Due to the fast-spreading nature of COVID-19 the prevention and control strategies become challenging. It is imposing social, psychological, and socio-economic impacts. We recommended that following social distancing, isolation suspects, using personal protective equipment, health education and introducing handwashing practices, avoiding contact with animals, vaccine development and treatment for controlling and prevention.","Berhe, B.; Legese, H.; Degefa, H.; Adhanom, G.; Gebrewahd, A.; Mardu, F.; Tesfay, K.; Welay, M.; Negash, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051052v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051052v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
495,Synchronized travel restrictions across cities can be effective in COVID-19 control,"Mobility control measures are of crucial importance for public health planning in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies established the impact of population outflow from Wuhan on the spatial spread of coronavirus in China and hinted the impact of the other three mobility patterns, i.e., population outflow from Hubei province excluding Wuhan, population inflow from cities outside Hubei, and intra-city population movement. However, the overall impact of all mobility patterns, or the impact of the different timing of mobility restriction intervention, are not systematically analyzed. Here we apply the cumulative confirmed cases and mobility data of 350 Chinese cities outside Hubei to explore the relationships between all mobility patterns and epidemic spread, and estimate the impact of local travel restrictions, both in terms of level and timing, on the epidemic control based on mobility change. The relationships were identified by using Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise multivariable linear regression, while scenario simulation was used to estimate the mobility change caused by local travel restrictions. Our analysis shows that: (1) all mobility patterns correlated with the spread of the coronavirus in Chinese cities outside Hubei, while the corrleations droppd with the implemetation of travel restrictions; (2) the cumulative confirmed cases in two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown was mainly brought by three patterns of inter-city population movement, while those in the third and fourth weeks after was significantly influenced by the number of intra-city population movement; (3) the local travel restrictions imposed by cities outside Hubei have averted 1,960 (95%PI: 1,474-2,447) more infections, taking 22.4% (95%PI: 16.8%-27.9%) of confirmed ones, in two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, while more synchronized implementation would further decrease the number of confirmed cases in the same period by 15.7% (95%PI:15.4%-16.0%) or 1,378 (95%PI: 1,353-1,402) cases; and (4) local travel restrictions on different mobility patterns have different degrees of protection on cities with or without initial confirmed cases until the Wuhan lockdown. Our results prove the effectiveness of local travel restrictions and highlight the importance of synchronized implementation of mobility control across cities in mitigating the COVID-19 transmission.","Liu, H.; Bai, X.; Shen, H.; Pang, X.; Liang, Z.; Liu, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050781v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050781v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
496,Epidemiological Characteristics of COVID-19: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Our understanding of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to evolve. However, there are many unknowns about its epidemiology. Purpose: To synthesize the number of deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases, incubation period, as well as time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first medical visit, ICU admission, recovery and death of COVID-19. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019 through to March 11, 2020 without language restrictions as well as bibliographies of relevant articles. Study Selection: Quantitative studies that recruited people living with or died due to COVID-19. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Conflicts were resolved through discussion with a senior author. Data Synthesis: Out of 1675 non-duplicate studies identified, 57 were included. Pooled mean incubation period was 5.84 (99% CI: 4.83, 6.85) days. Pooled mean number of days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical visit was 4.82 (95% CI: 3.48, 6.15), ICU admission was 10.48 (95% CI: 9.80, 11.16), recovery was 17.76 (95% CI: 12.64, 22.87), and until death was 15.93 (95% CI: 13.07, 18.79). Pooled probability of COVID-19-related death was 0.02 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.03). Limitations: Studies are observational and findings are mainly based on studies that recruited patient from clinics and hospitals and so may be biased toward more severe cases. Conclusion: We found that the incubation period and lag between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 is longer than other respiratory viral infections including MERS and SARS; however, the current policy of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone might be too conservative. Longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases.","Khalili, M.; Karamouzian, M.; Nasiri, N.; Javadi, S.; Mirzazadeh, A.; Sharifi, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050138v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050138v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
497,Seeding COVID-19 across sub-Saharan Africa: an analysis of reported importation events across 40 countries,"Background: The first case of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was reported by Nigeria on February 27, 2020. While case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, SSA countries remain vulnerable to significant COVID morbidity and mortality due to systemic healthcare weaknesses, less financial resources and infrastructure to address the new crisis, and untreated comorbidities. Variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events. Methods: Confirmed cases reported by SSA countries were line-listed to capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries. Data were retrieved from publicly available sources, including institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts, with supplementary details obtained from news articles. A data availability score was calculated for each imported case in terms of how many indicators (sex, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected) could be identified. We assessed the relationship between time to first importation and overall Global Health Security Index (GHSI) using Cox regression. K-means clustering grouped countries according to healthcare capacity and health and demographic risk factors. Results: A total of 2417 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa during the 30 days after the first known introduction to the region. Out of the 876 cases for which information was publicly available, 677 (77.3%) were considered importation events. At the regional level, imported cases tended to be male (67.3%), were a median 43.0 years old (Range: 6 weeks - 88 years), and most frequently had recent travel history from Europe (43.3%). The median time to reporting an introduction was 19 days; a country's time to report its first importation was not related to GHSI. Mean data availability scores were lowest for countries that had, on average, the highest case fatality rates, lowest healthcare capacity, and highest probability of premature death due to non-communicable diseases. Conclusion: Countries with systemic, demographic, and pre-existing health vulnerabilities to severe COVID-related morbidity and mortality are less likely to report any cases or are reporting with limited public availability of information. Reporting of information on COVID detection and response efforts, as well as on trends in non-COVID illness and care-seeking behavior, is critical to assessing direct and indirect consequences and capacity needs in resource-constrained settings. Such assessments aid in the ability to make data-driven decisions about interventions, country priorities, and risk assessment.","Skrip, L. A.; Selvaraj, P.; Hagedorn, B.; Ouedraogo, A.

498,Facemasks and similar barriers to prevent respiratory illness such asCOVID-19: A rapid systematic review,"The current pandemic of COVID-19 has lead to conflicting opinions on whether wearing facemasks outside of health care facilities protects against the infection. To better understand the value of wearing facemasks we undertook a rapid systematic review of existing scientific evidence about development of respiratory illness, linked to use of facemasks in community settings. METHODS: We included all study designs. There were 31 eligible studies (including 12 RCTs). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention in 28 studies were performed. Results were reported by design, setting and type of face barrier in primary prevention, and by who wore the facemask (index patient or well contacts) in secondary prevention trials. The preferred outcome was influenza-like illness (ILI) but similar outcomes were pooled with ILI when ILI was unavailable. GRADE quality assessment was based on RCTs with support from observational studies. RESULTS: Where specific information was available, most studies reported about use of medical grade (surgical paper masks). In 3 RCTs, wearing a facemask may very slightly reduce the odds of developing ILI/respiratory symptoms, by around 6% (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19, I2 29%, low certainty evidence). Greater effectiveness was suggested by observational studies. When both house-mates and an infected household member wore facemasks the odds of further household members becoming ill may be modestly reduced by around 19% (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.37, I 2 45%, 5 RCTs, low certainty evidence). The protective effect was very small if only the well person(OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, I2 11%, 2 RCTs, low uncertainty evidence) or the infected person wore the facemask (very low certainty evidence). DISCUSSION: Based on the RCTs we would conclude that wearing facemasks can be very slightly protective against primary infection from casual community contact, and modestly protective against household infections when both infected and uninfected members wear facemasks. However, the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls using facemasks. Across observational studies the evidence in favour of wearing facemasks was stronger. We expect RCTs to under-estimate the protective effect and observational studies to exaggerate it. The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations. Further high quality trials are needed to assess when wearing a facemask in the community is most likely to be protective.","Brainard, J.

499,Differential COVID-19-attributable mortality and BCG vaccine use in countries,"While mortality attributable to COVID-19 has devastated global health systems and economies, striking regional differences have been observed. The Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine has previously been shown to have non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as long-term efficacy against tuberculosis. Using publicly available data we built a simple log-linear regression model to assess the association of BCG use and COVID-19-attributable mortality per 1 million population after adjusting for confounders including country economic status (GDP per capita), and proportion of elderly among the population. The timing of country entry into the pandemic epidemiological trajectory was aligned by plotting time since the 100th reported case. Countries with economies classified as lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and high-income countries (LMIC, UMIC, HIC) had median crude COVID-19 log-mortality of 0.4 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.1, 0.4), 0.7 (IQR 0.2, 2.2) and 5.5 (IQR 1.6, 13.9), respectively. COVID-19-attributable mortality among BCG-using countries was 5.8 times lower [95% CI 1.8-19.0] than in non BCG-using countries. Notwithstanding limitations due to testing constraints in LMICs, case ascertainment bias and a plausible rise of cases as countries progress along the epidemiological trajectory, these analyses provide intriguing observations that urgently warrant mobilization of resources for prospective randomized interventional studies and institution of systematic disease surveillance, particularly in LMICs.","Shet, A.; Ray, D.; Malavige, N.; Santosham, M.; Bar-Zeev, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049478v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049478v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
500,Modelling fatality curves of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of intervention strategies,"The main objective of the present paper is twofold: first, to model the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease, as represented by the cumulative number of deaths as a function of time; and second, to use the corresponding mathematical model to study the effectiveness of possible intervention strategies. We applied the Richards growth model (RGM) to the COVID-19 fatality curves from several countries, where we used the data from the Johns Hopkins University database up to April 1, 2020. Countries selected for analysis were China, Italy, Spain, Iran, and Brazil. The RGM was shown to describe very well the fatality curves of China, which is in a late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as of Italy, Spain, and Iran, which supposedly are in the middle of the outbreak at the time of this writing. As for Brazil, which is still in the so-called exponential growth regime, we used the generalized growth model which is more appropriate for such cases. An analytic formula for the efficiency of intervention strategies within the context of the RGM is derived. Our findings show that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the onset of the epidemic, during which effective countermeasures can be taken.

501,"Virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe COVID-19: a retrospective observational study in Wuhan, China","Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has progressed to a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The WHO and the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued interim clinical guidance for management of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but there is limited data on the virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe COVID-19. Methods: A total of 50 patients with severe COVID-19 were divided into good and poor recovery groups. The dynamic viral shedding and serological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were explored. The risk factors associated with poor recovery and lung lesion resolutions were identified. In addition, the potential relationships among the viral shedding, the pro-inflammatory response, and lung lesion evolutions were characterized. Results: A total of 58% of the patients had poor recovery and were more likely to have a prolonged interval of viral shedding. The longest viral shedding was 57 days after symptom onset. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid therapy, consolidation on chest computed-tomography (CT), and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive were all associated with poor recovery. Additionally, the odds of impaired lung lesion resolutions were higher in patients with hypoproteinemia, hyperlipemia, and elevated levels of IL-4 and ferritin. Finally, viral shedding and proinflammatory responses were closely correlated with lung lesion evolutions on chest CT. Conclusions Patients with severe COVID-19 have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed intermittent viral shedding. Older age, hyperlipemia, hypoproteinemia, corticosteroid usage, and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive might be utilized as predicative factors for the patients with poor recovery.","Fu, S.; Fu, X.; Song, Y.; Li, M.; Pan, P.-h.; Tang, T.; Zhang, C.; Jiang, T.; Tan, D.; Fan, X.; Sha, X.; Ma, J.; Huang, Y.; Li, S.; Zheng, Y.; Qian, Z.; Xiong, Z.; Xiao, L.; Long, H.; Chen, J.; Ouyang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20051763v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20051763v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
502,A case of SARS-CoV-2 carrier for 32 days with several times false negative nucleic acid tests,"In 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei, China, causing severe respiratory disease in humans, and has been identified as a public health emergency of international concern. With the spread of the virus, there are more and more false negative cases of RT-PCR nucleic acid detection in the early stage of potential infection. In this paper, we collected the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, outcomes, laboratory results and images of a SARS-CoV-2 carrier with no significant past medical history. The patient was quarantined because of her colleague had been diagnosed. After the onset of clinical symptoms, chest CT results showed patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her lungs, but it took a total of nine nucleic acid tests to confirm the diagnosis, among which the first eight RT-PCR results were negative or single-target positive. In addition to coughing up phlegm during her stay in the hospital, she did not develop chills, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other clinical symptoms. Since initial antiviral treatment, the lung lesions were absorbed. But the sputum nucleic acid test was still positive. In combination with antiviral and immune therapy, the patient tested negative for the virus. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was detected only in the lower respiratory tract samples (sputum) throughout the diagnosis and treatment period. This is a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with common symptoms, and her diagnosis has undergone multiple false negatives ,suggesting that it is difficult to identify certain carriers of the virus and that such patients may also increase the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.","Song, L.; He, M.; Jia, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20045401v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20045401v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
503,A novel cohort analysis approach to determining the case fatality rate of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases,"As the Coronavirus contagion develops, it is increasingly important to understand the dynamics of the disease. Its severity is best described by two parameters: its ability to spread and its lethality. Here, we combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: the final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t0). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k, and t0), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We were able to predict the CFR much closer to reality at all stages of the viral outbreak compared to traditional methods. This model can be used far more effectively than current models to estimate the CFR during an outbreak, allowing for better planning. The model can also help us better understand the impact of individual interventions on the CFR. With much better data collection and labeling, we should be able to improve our predictive power even further.","Narayanan, C.

We demonstrated that self-sampling with foam swabs at home is well-tolerated and provides quantitative viral output concordant with flocked swabs. Nasal cytokine levels correlate and cluster according to immune cell of origin. Periods of stable viral loads are followed by rapid elimination, which could be coupled with cytokine expansion and contraction using mathematical models.

505,Development and Validation of a Diagnostic Nomogram to Predict COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: The COVID-19 virus is an emerging virus rapidly spread worldwide This study aimed to establish an effective diagnostic nomogram for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: We used the LASSO aggression and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the predictive factors associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, and established the diagnostic nomogram for COVID-19 pneumonia using multivariable regression. This diagnostic nomogram was assessed by the internal and external validation data set. Further, we plotted decision curves and clinical impact curve to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this diagnostic nomogram. RESULTS: The predictive factors including the epidemiological history, wedge-shaped or fan-shaped lesion parallel to or near the pleura, bilateral lower lobes, ground glass opacities, crazy paving pattern and white blood cell (WBC) count were contained in the nomogram. In the primary cohort, the C-statistic for predicting the probability of the COVID-19 pneumonia was 0.967, even higher than the C-statistic (0.961) in initial viral nucleic acid nomogram which was established using the univariable regression. The C-statistic was 0.848 in external validation cohort. Good calibration curves were observed for the prediction probability in the internal validation and external validation cohort. The nomogram both performed well in terms of discrimination and calibration. Moreover, decision curve and clinical impact curve were also beneficial for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. CONCLUSION: Our nomogram can be used to predict COVID-19 pneumonia accurately and favourably.","Wang, Z.; Weng, J.; Li, Z.; Hou, R.; Zhou, L.; Ye, H.; Chen, Y.; Yang, T.; Chen, D.; Wang, L.; Liu, X.; Shen, X.; Jin, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052068v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052068v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
506,Pressure-Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS): A COVID-19 Response Paradigm from Yale University,"In the current COVID-19 crisis, the US and many countries in the world are suffering acute shortages of modern ventilators to care for desperately ill patients. Since modern ICU ventilators are powerful devices that can deliver very high gas flow rates and pressures, multiple physicians have attempted to ventilate more than one patient on a single ventilator -- so-called 'vent splitting'. Early applications of this approach have utilized simple concatenations of ventilator tubing and T-pieces, to provide flow to more than one patient. Additional approaches using custom flow splitters -- sometimes made using 3D printing technologies -- have also advanced into the clinic with FDA approval. However, heretofore there has been less progress made on controlling individual ventilatory pressures for patients with severe lung disease. Given the inherent variability and instability of lung compliance amongst patients with COVID-19, there remains an important need to provide a means of extending ventilator usefulness to more than one patient, but in a way that provides more tailored pressures that can be titrated over time. In this descriptive report, we provide the basis for a ventilator circuit that can support two patients with individualized peak inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures. The circuit is comprised of exclusively 'off the shelf' materials and is inexpensive to produce. The circuit can be used with typical ICU ventilators, and with anesthesia ventilators used in operating rooms. Inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures for each patient can be titrated over time, without changes for one patient affecting the ventilation parameters of the other patient. Using in-line spirometry, individual tidal volumes can be measured for each patient. This Pressure-Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS) Yale University protocol operates under a pressure-control ventilatory mode, and may function optimally when patients are not triggering breaths from the ventilator. This method has been tested thus far only in the laboratory with mock lungs, and has not yet been deployed in animals or in patients. However, given the novelty and potential utility of this approach, we deemed it appropriate to provide this information to the broader critical care community at the present time. In coming days and weeks, we will continue to characterize and refine this approach, using large animal models and proof-of-principle human studies.","Raredon, M. S.

Method We verified in a consecutive series of 191 symptomatic patients the clinical information that new rapid serological colorimetric test qualitatively analyzing IgM/IgG expression can provide with respect to standard assay and with respect to clinical outcome of patients. Results Rapid serological test showed a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% with respect to the standard assay but, interestingly, these performances improve after 8 days of symptoms appearance. After 10 days of symptoms the predictive value of rapid serological test is higher than that of standard assay. When the behaviour of the two immunoglobulins was evaluated with respect to time length of symptoms appearance, no significant difference in immunoglobulins behaviour was shown. Conclusions The rapid serological test analyzed in the present study is candidate to provide information on immunoreaction of the subject to COVID-19 exposure.","Paradiso, A.

508,Pooling RT-PCR or NGS samples has the potential to cost-effectively generate estimates of COVID-19 prevalence in resource limited environments,"Background: COVID-19 originated in China and has quickly spread worldwide causing a pandemic. Countries need rapid data on the prevalence of the virus in communities to enable rapid containment. However, the equipment, human and laboratory resources required for conducting individual RT-PCR is prohibitive. One technique to reduce the number of tests required is the pooling of samples for analysis by RT-PCR prior to testing. Methods: We conducted a mathematical analysis of pooling strategies for infection rate classification using group testing and for the identification of individuals by testing pooled clusters of samples. Findings: On the basis of the proposed pooled testing strategy we calculate the probability of false alarm, the probability of detection, and the average number of tests required as a function of the pool size. We find that when the sample size is 256, with a maximum pool size of 64, with only 7.3 tests on the average, we can distinguish between prevalences of 1% and 5% with a probability of detection of 95% and probability of false alarm of 4%. Interpretation: The pooling of RT-PCR samples is a cost-effective technique for providing much-needed course-grained data on the prevalence of COVID-19. This is a powerful tool in providing countries with information that can facilitate a response to the pandemic that is evidence-based and saves the most lives possible with the resources available.","Narayanan, K.; Frost, I.; Heidarzadeh, A.; Tseng, K.

509,Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a COVID-19 recovered patient cohort and their implications,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus threatens global public health. Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestations in patients. Methods Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. Findings SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P<0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: < 40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response. Interpretation The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

510,Covid-19 excess deaths in the United States through July 2020,"Background: Some have claimed that the number of COVID-19 deaths is not much greater than would be experienced in the usual course of events. We sought to estimate the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States during April 2020 and compare that to the number of expected deaths in the same time period. Methods: The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicts that 67,212 COVID-19 deaths will occur during April 2020. To obtain the number of excess COVID-19 deaths, we multiplied published infection fatality rates by age by population numbers to obtain assumed infection rates. We then subtracted the expected number of deaths calculated using life table mortality rates. Results: During April 2020 there may be 61,690 to 62,526 excess deaths. Population infection rates of 3.6% to 4.3% by mid-April 2020 would generate the number of COVID-19 deaths predicted by IHME. Conclusions: During April 2020 over 90% of the COVID-19 deaths can be classified as excess deaths. These deaths would normally occur over 11.2 to 13.3 months instead of being concentrated in 1 month.","Wetzler, H. P.; Wetzler, E.

511,ACE2 variants underlie interindividual variability and susceptibility to COVID-19 in Italian population,"In December 2019, an initial cluster of unexpected interstitial bilateral pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province. A human-to-human transmission was immediately assumed and a previously unrecognized entity, termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was suddenly described. The infection has rapidly spread out all over the world and Italy has been the first European Country experiencing the endemic wave with unexpected clinical severity in comparison with Asian countries. It has recently been shown that 2019-nCov utilizes host receptors namely angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host receptor and host proteases for cell surface binding and internalization. Thus, a predisposing genetic background can give reason for interindividual disease susceptibility and/or severity. Taking advantage of the Network of Italian Genomes (NIG), here we mined around 7000 exomes from 5 different Centers looking for ACE2 variants. A number of variants with a potential impact on protein stability were identified. Among these, three missense changes, p.Asn720Asp, p.Lys26Arg, p.Gly211Arg (MAF 0.002 to 0.015), which have never been reported in the Eastern Asia population, were predicted to interfere with protein cleavage and stabilization. Rare truncating variants likely interfering with the internalization process and one missense variant, p.Trp69Cys, predicted to interfere with 2019-nCov spike protein binding were also observed. These findings suggest that a predisposing genetic background may contribute to the observed inter-individual clinical variability associated with COVID-19. They allow an evidence-based risk assessment opening up the way to personalized preventive measures and therapeutic options.","Renieri, A.; Benetti, E.; Tita, R.; Spiga, O.; Ciolfi, A.; Birolo, G.; Bruselles, A.; Doddato, G.; Giliberti, A.; Marconi, C.; Musacchia, F.; Pippucci, T.; Torella, A.; Trezza, A.; Valentino, F.; Baldassarri, M.; Brusco, A.; Asselta, R.; Mirella, B.; Furini, S.; Seri, M.; Nigro, V.; Matullo, G.; Tartaglia, M.; Mari, F.; Pinto, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20047977v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20047977v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True

COVID-19 patients manifested as lung injury with complications in other organs, such as liver, heart, gastrointestinal tract, especially for severe cases. However, whether COVID-19 causes significant acute kidney injury (AKI) remained controversial. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, urine and blood routine tests and other laboratory parameters of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Union Hospital. Findings: 178 patients, admitted to Wuhan Union hospital from February 02 to February 29, 2020, were included in this study. No patient (0 [0%]) presented increased serum creatinine (Scr), and 5 (2.8%) patients showed increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating few cases with kidney dysfunction. However, for patients (83) with no history of kidney disease who received routine urine test upon hospitalization, 45 (54.2%) patients displayed abnormality in urinalysis, such as proteinuria, hematuria and leukocyturia, while none of the patients was recorded to have acute kidney injury (AKI) throughout the study. Meanwhile, the patients with abnormal urinalysis usually had worse disease progression reflecting by laboratory parameters presentations, including markers of liver injury, inflammation, and coagulation. Conclusion: Many patients manifested by abnormal urinalysis on admission, including proteinuria or hematuria. Our results revealed that urinalysis is better in unveiling potential kidney impairment of COVID-19 patients than blood chemistry test and urinalysis could be used to reflect and predict the disease severity.

513,"Frequency of testing for COVID 19 infection and the presence of higher number of available beds per country predict outcomes with the infection, not the GDP of the country - A descriptive statistical analysis","Introduction: The novel coronavirus epidemic which originated in late 2019 from China has wreaked havoc on millions across the world with illness, death and socioeconomic recession. As of now no valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved worldwide and governments across the world have been forced to take the draconian step of social isolation in communities by enforcing lockdowns. Aim of this Study: This study aims to correlate the rates of infection with the novel coronavirus and total deaths as the primary output variable. In addition the strength of association between infection rates and total death in comparison to GDP share of the respective countries, physicians, hospital beds and rates of testing for COVID 19 infection per thousand patients, is being assessed, in a bid to develop a model which would help to develop tools to reduce the impact of this disease. Material & Methods Data relating to number of cases, severity, cases recovered and deaths worldwide and specifically for the top six countries affected was collected from the WHO COVID-19 situation report which is being updated on a daily basis till 22nd March 2020, the date of analysis. Additional data related to GDP, physician and hospital bed per 1000 patients were procured from the World Bank database. All data were collected in a file in CSV format. Analysis was conducted in Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 software and also with XL-Stat statistical software for excel. The analytical strategy was descriptive with no inferential overtones. Results: COVID 19 infection strongly correlates with total deaths (r : 0.89), with a predicted death rate of 25 patients per 1000 affected. There was no correlation between the GDP growth of the country and number of treating physicians/1000 patient population with any COVID 19 related outcome. However there was a negative correlation between COVID 19-related deaths and the number of beds available per 1000 population [r=-0.34]. Importantly there is an inverse correlation between the number of tests conducted per million population with the rates of active infections [r=-0.12] , new cases [r=-0.38] and new deaths [r=-0.28] in COVID 19. Conclusion: This is the first study to assess parameters other than age and sex and sets out a robust dataset which indicates an increased risk of worsening outcomes with lesser number of beds and testing, suggesting that the need of the hour is to increase available bed numbers and to increase rates of testing.","GHOSAL, S.; Sinha, B.; Sengupta, S.; Majumder, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047373v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047373v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
514,"Forecast of the COVID-19 outbreak, collapse of medical facilities, and lockdown effects in Tokyo, Japan","Background: The number of patients of COVID-19 in Tokyo has been increasing gradually through the end of March, 2020. Object: Support for policymaking requires forecasting of the entire course and outcome of the outbreak including the date of collapse of medical facilities if a lockdown is not initiated. Moreover, the effects of a lockdown must be considered when choosing to initiate one. Method: Data of Tokyo patients with symptoms during January 14-March 28, 2020 were used to formulate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model using three age classes and to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0). Based on the estimated R0, We inferred outbreak outcomes including the date of collapse of medical facilities if a lockdown were not enacted. Then we estimate the lockdown effects. Results: Results suggest R0 as 2.86, with a 95% confidence interval of [2.73, 2.97]. Collapse of medical facilities can be expected to occur on April 26 if no lockdown occurs. The total number of deaths can be expected to be half a million people. If a lockdown were enacted from April 6, and if more than 60% of trips outside the home were restricted voluntarily, then a collapse of medical facilities could be avoided. Discussion and Conclusion: The estimated R0 was similar to that found from other studies conducted in China and Japan. Results demonstrate that a lockdown with reasonable cooperation of residents can avoid a collapse of medical facilities and save 0.25 million mortality cases.","Sugishita, Y.; Kurita, J.; Sugawara, T.; Ohkusa, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051490v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051490v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True

516,Could SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted via speech droplets?,"Speaking may be a primary mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Considering that reports of asymptomatic transmission account for 50-80% of COVID-19 cases and that saliva has peak viral loads at time of patient presentation, droplet emission while speaking could be a significant factor driving transmission and warrants further study. We used a planar beam of laser light passing through a dust-free enclosure to detect saliva droplets emitted while speaking. We found that saying the words 'Stay Healthy' generates thousands of droplets that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. A damp homemade cloth face mask dramatically reduced droplet excretion, with none of the spoken words causing a droplet rise above the background. Our preliminary findings have important implications for pandemic mitigation efforts.","Anfinrud, P.; Bax, C.

519,Rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 infection through machine learning based on clinical available blood test results,"Since the sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has rapidly evolved into a momentous global health concern. Due to the lack of constructive information on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and specific treatment, it highlights the importance of early diagnosis and timely treatment. In this study, 11 key blood indices were extracted through random forest algorithm to build the final assistant discrimination tool from 49 clinical available blood test data which were derived by commercial blood test equipments. The method presented robust outcome to accurately identify COVID-19 from a variety of suspected patients with similar CT information or similar symptoms, with accuracy of 0.9795 and 0.9697 for the cross-validation set and test set, respectively. The tool also demonstrated its outstanding performance on an external validation set that was completely independent of the modeling process, with sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 0.9512, 0.9697, and 0.9595, respectively. Besides, 24 samples from overseas infected patients with COVID-19 were used to make an in-depth clinical assessment with accuracy of 0.9167. After multiple verification, the reliability and repeatability of the tool has been fully evaluated, and it has the potential to develop into an emerging technology to identify COVID-19 and lower the burden of global public health. The proposed tool is well-suited to carry out preliminary assessment of suspected patients and help them to get timely treatment and quarantine suggestion.

520,Widespread use of face masks in public may slow the spread of SARS CoV-2: an ecological study,"Background The reasons for the large differences between countries in the sizes of their SARS CoV2 epidemics is unknown. Individual level studies have found that the use of face masks was protective for the acquisition and transmission of a range of respiratory viruses including SARS CoV1. We hypothesized that population level usage of face masks may be negatively associated SARS CoV2 spread. Methods At a country level, linear regression was used to assess the association between COVID19 diagnoses per inhabitant and the national promotion of face masks in public (coded as a binary variable), controlling for the age of the COVID19 epidemic and testing intensity. Results Eight of the 49 countries with available data advocated wearing face masks in public: China, Czechia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia. In multivariate analysis face mask use was negatively associated with number of COVID19 cases/inhabitant (coef. -326, 95% CI -601- -51, P=0.021). Testing intensity was positively associated with COVID-19 cases (coef. 0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.08, P<0.001). Conclusion Whilst these results are susceptible to residual confounding, they do provide ecological level support to the individual level studies that found face mask usage to reduce the transmission and acquisition of respiratory viral infections.","Kenyon, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048652v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048652v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
521,Association of BCG vaccination policy with prevalence and mortality of COVID-19,"There is some evidence that tuberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has non-specific beneficial effects against non-related infections. Here, we examined the possible association between BCG vaccination with prevalence and mortality by COVID-19 by using publicly available data of COVID-19 in 199 countries/regions and the BCG World Atlas. By using linear regression modeling, we found that the number of total cases and deaths per one million population were significantly associated with the country's policy concerning BCG vaccine administration. The amount of variance in cases and deaths explained by BCG vaccination policy ranged between 12.5% and 38%. Importantly, this effect remained significant after controlling for the country's life expectancy and the average temperature in February and March 2020, which themselves are significantly correlated with the cases and deaths indices, respectively. By contrast, the ratio between deaths and cases was weakly affected. This latter outcome suggested that BCG vaccination may have hindered the overall spread of the virus or progression of the disease rather than reducing mortality rates (i.e., deaths/cases ratio). Finally, by roughly dividing countries into three categories showing high, middle, or low growth rate of the cases, we found a highly significant difference between the slope categories among the BCG groups, suggesting that the time since the onset of the spread of the virus was not a major confounding factor. While this study potentially suffers from a number of unknown confounding factors, these associations support the idea that BCG vaccination may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2, which, together with its proven safety, encourages consideration of further detailed epidemiological studies, large-scale clinical trials on the efficacy of this vaccine on COVID-19, and/or re-introduction of BCG vaccination practice in the countries which are currently devoid of the practice.","Sala, G.; Miyakawa, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048165v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048165v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True

The clinical evidence to date suggests that pregnant and childbearing women, and their babies are not at increased risk of either getting infected, or of having severe symptoms or consequences than the population as a whole. There is no evidence on the short- and longer-term psychological impacts of restrictive practices or social and personal constraints for childbearing women during COVID-19 in particular, or infection pandemics in general. The potential for adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic should be recognised as a critical public health concern, together with appropriate care and support to prevent and ameliorate any negative impacts.","Topalidou, A.; Thomson, G.; Downe, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047969v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047969v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
524,Impact of viral epidemic outbreaks on mental health of healthcare workers: a rapid systematic review,"Objectives: To examine the impact of providing healthcare during or after health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers (HCWs) mental health, and to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact. Design: Systematic rapid review and meta-analysis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, searched up to 23 March 2020. Method: We selected observational and experimental studies examining the impact on mental health of epidemic outbreaks on HCWs. Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer, and full texts were evaluated by two reviewers independently. We extracted study characteristics, symptoms, prevalence of mental health problems, risk factors, mental health interventions, and its impact. We assessed risk of bias for each individual study. We conducted a narrative and tabulated synthesis of the results. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. We followed the GRADE approach to assess the certainty in the evidence. Results: We included 61 studies (56 examining impact on mental health and five about interventions to reduce such impact). Most were conducted in Asia (59%), examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%), and took place in the hospital setting (79%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants) and post-traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic: younger age and female gender; social factors: lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization; and occupational: working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. Two out of five interventions identified were educational aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs resilience. These interventions showed positive effects in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention (based on training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic produced statistically significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). The impact of the two remaining interventions (multifaceted and based on psychotherapy provision) was unreported. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout, was high both during and after the outbreaks. These problems not only have a long-lasting effect on the mental health of HCWs, but also hinder the urgent response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, by jeopardising attention and decision-making. Governments and healthcare authorities should take urgent actions to protect the mental health of HCWs. In light of the limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified in this study represent important targets for future interventions.","Ricci Cabello, I.; Meneses Echavez, J.

525,Quantifying the effect of quarantine control in Covid-19 infectious spread using machine learning,"Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on Dec 31, 2019, the disease has spread worldwide and met with a wide variety of social distancing and quarantine policies. The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24 till March 3 window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.","Dandekar, R.; Barbastathis, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052084v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052084v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
526,"Rapid evidence summary on SARS-CoV-2 survivorship and disinfection, and a reusable PPE protocol using a double-hit process","In the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, hospitals are stretched beyond capacity. There are widespread reports of dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), which are paramount to protect frontline medical/nursing staff and to minimize further spread of the virus. We carried out a rapid review to summarize the existing evidence on SARS-CoV-2 survivorship and methods to disinfect PPE gear, particularly N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR). In the absence of data on SARS-CoV-2, we focused on the sister virus SARS-CoV-1. We propose a two-step disinfection process, which is conservative in the absence of robust evidence on SARS-CoV-2. This disinfection protocol is based on an initial storage of PPE for [&ge;]4 days, followed by ultraviolet light (UVC), dry heat treatment, or chemical disinfection. Importantly, each of the two steps is based on independent disinfection mechanisms, so that our proposed protocol is a multiplicative system, maximising the efficacy of our disinfection process. This method could be rapidly implemented in other healthcare settings, while testing of each method is undertaken, increasing the frontline supply of PPE, and avoiding many of the upstream issues of supply chain disruption currently being faced.","Derraik, J.

527,Ultra-High-Resolution CT Follow-Up in Patients with Imported Early-Stage Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Related Pneumonia,"Background: An ongoing outbreak of mystery pneumonia in Wuhan was caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The infectious disease has spread globally and become a major threat to public health. Purpose: We aim to investigate the ultra-high-resolution CT (UHR-CT) findings of imported COVID-19 related pneumonia from the initial diagnosis to early-phase follow-up. Methods: This retrospective study included confirmed cases with early-stage COVID-19 related pneumonia imported from the epicenter. Initial and early-phase follow-up UHR-CT scans (within 5 days) were reviewed for characterizing the radiological findings. The normalized total volumes of ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were calculated and compared during the radiological follow-up by artificial-intelligence-based methods. Results: Eleven patients (3 males and 8 females, aged 32-74 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. Subpleural GGOs with inter/intralobular septal thickening were typical imaging findings. Other diagnostic CT features included distinct margins (8/11, 73%), pleural retraction or thickening (7/11, 64%), intralesional vasodilatation (6/11, 55%). Normalized volumes of pulmonary GGOs (p=0.003) and consolidations (p=0.003) significantly increased during the CT follow-up. Conclusions: The abnormalities of GGOs with peripleural distribution, consolidated areas, septal thickening, pleural involvement and intralesional vasodilatation on UHR-CT indicate the diagnosis of COVID-19. COVID-19 cases could manifest significantly progressed GGOs and consolidations with increased volume during the early-phase CT follow-up.","Lin, Y.; Lv, S.; Wang, J.; Kang, J.; Zhang, Y.; Feng, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048256v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048256v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
528,Building an International Consortium for Tracking Coronavirus Health Status,"Information is the most potent protective weapon we have to combat a pandemic, at both the individual and global level. For individuals, information can help us make personal decisions and provide a sense of security. For the global community, information can inform policy decisions and offer critical insights into the epidemic of COVID-19 disease. Fully leveraging the power of information, however, requires large amounts of data and access to it. To achieve this, we are making steps to form an international consortium, Coronavirus Census Collective (CCC, coronaviruscensuscollective.org), that will serve as a hub for integrating information from multiple data sources that can be utilized to understand, monitor, predict, and combat global pandemics. These sources may include self-reported health status through surveys (including mobile apps), results of diagnostic laboratory tests, and other static and real-time geospatial data. This collective effort to track and share information will be invaluable in predicting hotspots of disease outbreak, identifying which factors control the rate of spreading, informing immediate policy decisions, evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken by health organizations on pandemic control, and providing critical insight on the etiology of COVID-19. It will also help individuals stay informed on this rapidly evolving situation and contribute to other global efforts to slow the spread of disease. In the past few weeks, several initiatives across the globe have surfaced to use daily self-reported symptoms as a means to track disease spread, predict outbreak locations, guide population measures and help in the allocation of healthcare resources. The aim of this paper is to put out a call to standardize these efforts and spark a collaborative effort to maximize the global gain while protecting participant privacy.","Segal, E.; Zhang, F.; Lin, X.; King, G.; Shalem, O.; Shilo, S.; Allen, W.

529,"Perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 infection from event attendance: Results from Louisiana, USA, two weeks preceding the national emergency declaration","In response to the mounting threat of COVID-19, we added questions to an ongoing food preference study held at Louisiana State University from March 3-12 of 2020. We asked 356 participants: (1) In your opinion, how likely is it that the spread of COVID-19 (the coronavirus) will cause a public health crisis in the United States? (2) How concerned are you that you will contract COVID-19 by attending events on campus? Participants' estimates of an impending national health crisis increased significantly during the study's second week (March 9-12) while concern about personally contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events increased only marginally during the study's final days. We find those expressing a higher likelihood of an impending national crisis were more concerned about contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events, suggesting a possible transmission from perceptions of national-level events to perceived personal vulnerability via local exposure. However, about 30% of participants perceived that COVID-19 would likely cause a public health crisis yet did not express concern about contracting COVID-19 from event attendance. These participants were significantly more likely to be younger students who agreed to participate in response to recruitment using same-day flyer distribution. Women expressed a higher likelihood of an emerging national health crisis, although they were not more concerned than men that attending campus events would result in virus contraction. Other groups (e.g., white, students younger than 25, highest income group) displayed similar concern about a national-level crisis, yet were significantly less concerned about contracting COVID-19 from attending campus events than others. Also, participants randomly assigned to information emphasizing the national impacts of food waste expressed significantly greater concern of contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events.

530,Classification of Coronavirus Images using Shrunken Features,"Necessary screenings must be performed to control the spread of the Corona Virus (COVID-19) in daily life and to make a preliminary diagnosis of suspicious cases. The long duration of pathological laboratory tests and the wrong test results led the researchers to focus on different fields. Fast and accurate diagnoses are essential for effective interventions with COVID-19. The information obtained by using X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) images is vital in making clinical diagnoses. Therefore it was aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray images. In this study, images belonging to 6 situations, including coronavirus images, are classified. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, it is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods. For this purpose, firstly, all the images in the dataset are extracted with the help of four feature extraction algorithms. These extracted features are combined in raw form. The unbalanced data problem is eliminated by producing feature vectors with the SMOTE algorithm. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis to remove interconnected features in the feature vector.

531,Using curvature to infer COVID-19 fractal epidemic network fragility and systemic risk,"The damage of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is reaching unprecedented scales. There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. Usually, to forecast the epidemics, these classical approaches need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here we propose a data-driven, parameter-free approach to access the fragility and systemic risk of epidemic networks by studying the Forman-Ricci curvature. Network curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can be translated for COVID-19 epidemic time series as well. We first show that our hypothesis is true in a toy-model of epidemic time series with delays, which generates epidemic networks. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Forman-Ricci curvature can be a parameter-free estimate for the fragility and risk of the network at each stage of the simulated pandemic. On this basis, we then compute the Forman-Ricci curvature for real epidemic networks built from epidemic time series available from the World Health Organization (WHO). The Forman-Ricci curvature allow us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of the method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for epidemics, without the need of parameter estimation and stochastic modeling. The strategy above, together with other data-driven tools for investigating epidemic network dynamics, can be readily implemented on a daily basis to quickly estimate the growth, risk and fragility of real COVID-19 epidemic networks at different scales.","de Souza, D.

We employ OLS to perform the econometric estimation, and through RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE forecast performance measures we select the best lagged predictor of both dependent variables. Findings For Spain, our prediction shows that the best predictor of ICU admissions is the number of people infected eight days before, and that the best predictor of deaths is the number of people infected five days before. In the first case, we obtain a 98% coefficient of determination, and in the second a 97% coefficient. The estimated delayed elasticities find that a 1% increase in the number of cases today will imply a 0.72% increase in ICU patients eight days later and a 1.09% increase in the number of deaths five days later. Interpretation The model is not intended to analyse the epidemiology of COVID-19. Our objective is rather to estimate a leading indicator of clinical needs. Having a forecast model available several days in advance can enable governments to more effectively face the gap between needs and resources triggered by the outbreak and thus reduce the deaths caused by COVID-19.","Hierro-Recio, L.

533,Cryptic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State,"Following its emergence in Wuhan, China, in late November or early December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has rapidly spread throughout the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains allows for the reconstruction of transmission history connecting these infections. Here, we analyze 346 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from samples collected between 20 February and 15 March 2020 from infected patients in Washington State, USA. We found that the large majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections sampled during this time frame appeared to have derived from a single introduction event into the state in late January or early February 2020 and subsequent local spread, strongly suggesting cryptic spread of COVID-19 during the months of January and February 2020, before active community surveillance was implemented. We estimate a common ancestor of this outbreak clade as occurring between 18 January and 9 February 2020. From genomic data, we estimate an exponential doubling between 2.4 and 5.1 days. These results highlight the need for large-scale community surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 introductions and spread and the power of pathogen genomics to inform epidemiological understanding.","Bedford, T.; Greninger, A.

Leaving the economy locked down for a long time is its own catastrophe. An SIR-type model with clear parameters suitable for public information, and both tracking and predictive capabilities which learns disease spread characteristics rapidly as policy changes, suggests that a solution to the problem is a partial unlock. Case load can be managed so as not to exceed critical resources such as ventilators, yet allow enough people to get sick that herd immunity develops and a full unlock can be achieved in as little as five weeks from beginning of implementation. The partial unlock could be for example 3 full working days per week. Given that not all areas or individuals will respond, and travel and public gatherings are still unlikely, the partial unlock might be 5 full working days per week. The model can be regionalized easily, and by expediting the resolution of the pandemic in the U.S. medical equipment and volunteers, many of them with already acquired immunity, can be made available to other countries.","Shuler, R.

Governments the world over have instituted different measures to increase social distancing but information on their effectiveness in reducing mobility is lacking. We analyzed the mobility data from 41 cities to look at the effect of these interventions. The median mobility across cities on March 2, 2020 was 100% (IQR: 94%, 107%), which decreased to a median of 10% (IQR: 7%, 17%) on March 26, 2020. We found that the mobility decreased on average by 3.4% (95%CI: 3.3%, 3.6%) per day from March 2 through March 26.

Though government interventions such as lockdown and social distancing are theoretically useful, its debatable whether such interventions are effective in flattening the curve, which is ceasing or reducing the growth of infection in control populations.

On the contrary, I(t) curves for China and South Korea exhibits power law behavior before flattening of the curve. The derivative I(t), which is also the daily infection count, is proportional to I(t) for the exponential regime, but not for the power law regime. These valuable indicators could be used for epidemic forecast.

Further, the rate of growth of infections in India is very close to that in Washington and California. Exponential and classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models based on available data are used to make short and long-term predictions on a daily basis. Based on the SIR model, it is estimated that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May 2020 with the final epidemic size of approximately 13,000.

Fever is seen in most cases of COVID-19, at least at the initial stages of illness. Although fever is typically treated (with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness. Objective: To describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation. Methods: This prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) 24 hours after initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes include hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, amount of viral shedding, and 30-day mortality. Results: Resulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: pending. Conclusions: With growing data to support clinical benefits of elevated temperature in infectious illness, this study will provide data to guide further understanding of the role of active temperature management in COVID-19 treatment and provide effect size estimates to power larger studies.","Bonfanti, N.; Gundert, E.; Goff, K.; Drewry, A.; Bedimo, R.; Kulstad, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052001v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052001v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,True
543,COVID-19 scenario modelling for the mitigation of capacity-dependent deaths in intensive care: computer simulation study,"Background Managing healthcare demand and capacity is especially difficult in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where limited intensive care resources can be overwhelmed by a large number of cases requiring admission in a short space of time. If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. The aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity or reduce length of stay. Methods A stochastic discrete event simulation model is developed to represent the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. Model inputs are aligned to levers available to planners with key outputs including duration of time at maximum capacity (to inform workforce requirements), peak daily deaths (for mortuary planning), and total deaths (as an ultimate marker of intervention efficacy). The model - freely available - is applied to the COVID-19 response at a large hospital in England for which the effect of a number of possible interventions are simulated. Results Capacity-dependent deaths are closely associated with both the nature and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and availability of intensive care beds. For the hospital considered, results suggest that capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced five-fold through a combination of isolation policies, a doubling of bed capacity, and 25% reduced length of stay. Conclusions Without treatment or vaccination there is little that can be done to reduce deaths occurring when patients have otherwise been treated in the most appropriate hospital setting. Healthcare planners should therefore focus on minimising the capacity-dependent deaths that are within their influence.","Wood, R. M.; McWilliams, C. J.; Thomas, M. J.; Bourdeaux, C.

Furthermore, patients infected with similar strains (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) suffered testis, liver, or thyroid damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as an entry point into cells for some strains of coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). Our hypothesis was that as ACE2 is essential to the SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion, then brain regions where ACE2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection. Thus, the expression of other genes which are also over-expressed in those damaged areas could be affected. We used mRNA expression levels data of genes provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (ABA), and computed spatial correlations with the LinkRbrain platform. Genes whose co-expression is spatially correlated to that of ACE2 were then clustered into 16 groups, depending on the organ in which they are the most expressed (as described by the NCBI genes database). The list of organs where genes sharing local over-expression with the ACE2 gene are the most expressed is astonishingly similar to the organs affected by Covid-19.","Lapina, C.; Rodic, M.; Peschanski, D.; MESMOUDI, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.027318v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.027318v1?rss=1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,,False

To isolate RNA from respiratory samples, the CDC lists RNA extraction kits from three manufacturers. In anticipation of a limited supply chain of RNA extraction kits and the need for test scalability, we sought to identify alternative RNA extraction methods.

549,Rapid community-driven development of a SARS-CoV-2 tissue simulator,"The 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an emerging pathogen of critical significance to international public health. Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. A critical question for treatment and protection is why it appears that the severity of infection may correlate with the initial level of virus exposure. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable ""choke points"" for pharmacologic interactions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate response dynamics. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung and intestinal tissue that will be iteratively refined. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and interactive, cloud-hosted executables in under 12 hours. In a sustained community effort, this model will integrate data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health.

The identification of clinically approved drugs to be repurposed to combat 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir (ATV). ATV is of high interest because of its bioavailability within the respiratory tract. Our results show that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with greater strength than LPV. ATV blocked Mpro activity. We confirmed that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV) in Vero cells, human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary monocytes, impairing virus-induced enhancement of IL-6 and TNF- levels.

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes).

We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinsons disease. It is available as a generic drug..

Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.","Smieszek, S.; Przychodzen, B.; Polymeropoulos, M.

552,Indomethacin has a potent antiviral activity against SARS CoV-2 in vitro and canine coronavirus in vivo,"BackgroundThe outbreak of SARS CoV-2 has caused ever-increasing attention and public panic all over the world. Currently, there is no specific treatment against the SARS CoV-2. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. Previous studies found that indomethacin has the ability to inhibit the replication of several unrelated DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV.

MethodsSARS CoV-2 pseudovirus-infected African green monkey kidney VERO E6 cells treated with different concentrations of indomethacin or aspirin at 48 hours post infection (p.i). The level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity. Anti-coronavirus efficacy in vivo was confirmed by evaluating the time of recovery in canine coronavirus (CCV) infected dogs treated orally with 1mg/kg body weight indomethacin.

ResultsWe found that indomethacin has a directly and potently antiviral activity against the SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus (reduce relative light unit to zero). In CCV-infected dogs, recovery occurred significantly sooner with symptomatic treatment + oral indomethacin (1 mg/kg body weight) daily treatments than with symptomatic treatment + ribavirin (10-15 mg/kg body weight) daily treatments (P =0.0031), but was not significantly different from that with symptomatic treatment + anti-canine coronavirus serum + canine hemoglobin + canine blood immunoglobulin + interferon treatments (P =0.7784).

ConclusionThe results identify indomethacin as a potent inhibitor of SARS CoV-2.","Xu, T.; Gao, X.; Wu, Z.; Selinger, D.

553,"LY6E Restricts the Entry of Human Coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2","C3A is a sub-clone of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line with the strong contact inhibition of growth. We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.

ImportanceVirus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.","Zhao, X.; Zheng, S.; Chen, D.; Zheng, M.; Li, X.; Li, G.; Lin, H.; Chang, J.; Zeng, H.; Guo, J.-T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.021469v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.021469v1?rss=1,2020-04-05,2020-04-05,,False
554,Energetics based epitope screening in SARS CoV-2 (COVID 19) spike glycoprotein by Immuno-informatic analysis aiming to a suitable vaccine development.,"The recent outbreak by SARS-CoV-2 has generated a chaos in global health and economy and claimed/infected a large number of lives. Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time. Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratopic binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, IC50, MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition. The present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2.","Banerjee, A.; Santra, D.; Maiti, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.021725v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.021725v1?rss=1,2020-04-05,2020-04-05,,False
555,Increasing testing throughput and case detection with a pooled-sample Bayesian approach in the context of COVID-19,"Rapid and widespread implementation of infectious disease surveillance is a critical component in the response to novel health threats. Molecular assays are the preferred method to detect a broad range of pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity. The implementation of molecular assay testing in a rapidly evolving public health emergency can be hindered by resource availability or technical constraints. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicability of a pooled-sample testing protocol to screen large populations more rapidly and with limited resources is discussed. A Bayesian inference analysis in which hierarchical testing stages can have different sensitivities is implemented and benchmarked against early COVID-19 testing data. Optimal pool size and increases in throughput and case detection are calculated as a function of disease prevalence. Even for moderate losses in test sensitivity upon pooling, substantial increases in testing throughput and detection efficiency are predicted, suggesting that sample pooling is a viable avenue to circumvent current testing bottlenecks for COVID-19.","Noriega, R.; Samore, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024216v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024216v1?rss=1,2020-04-05,2020-04-05,,False
556,SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV differ in their cell tropism and drug sensitivity profiles,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently causing a pandemic. We show that the majority of amino acid positions, which differ between SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV, are differentially conserved suggesting differences in biological behaviour. In agreement, novel cell culture models revealed differences between the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Moreover, cellular ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and TMPRSS2 (enables virus entry via S protein cleavage) levels did not reliably indicate cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV further differed in their drug sensitivity profiles. Thus, only drug testing using SARS-CoV-2 reliably identifies therapy candidates. Therapeutic concentrations of the approved protease inhibitor aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The efficacy of aprotinin and of remdesivir (currently under clinical investigation against SARS-CoV-2) were further enhanced by therapeutic concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (aprotinin 2.7-fold, remdesivir 10-fold). Hence, our study has also identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy candidates that can be readily tested in patients.","Bojkova, D.; McGreig, J. E.; McLaughlin, K.-M.; Masterson, S.

557,Coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase and spike proteins co-evolve for functional balance and optimal virion avidity,"Human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are respiratory pathogen of zoonotic origin that have gained worldwide distribution. OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human and animal pathogens.","Lang, Y.; Li, W.; Li, Z.; Koerhuis, D.; van den Burg, A.

Repurposing of approved drugs is a strategy that can bypass the time consuming stages of drug development. In this study, we screened the Prestwick Chemical Library(R) composed of 1,520 approved drugs in an infected cell-based assay. 90 compounds were identified. The robustness of the screen was assessed by the identification of drugs, such as Chloroquine derivatives and protease inhibitors, already in clinical trials.

Tenofovir and emtricitabine are the two components in DESCOVY and TRUVADA, the two FDA-approved medications for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection. This is a preventative method in which individuals who are HIV negative (but at high-risk of contracting the virus) take the combination drug daily to reduce the chance of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP can stop HIV from replicating and spreading throughout the body.

Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, we identified the optimal combination of 5 and 3 UTR, termed as NASAR, which was five to ten-fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid-derived nanoparticles showed dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens both in vitro and in vivo.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the +RNA virus family that utilize single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecules as genomes. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, has an unusually large genome for a +RNA virus that encodes four structural proteins - the matrix (M), small envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) - and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Its N-terminal RNA binding domain (N-NTD) captures the RNA genome while the C-terminal domain anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane via its interaction with the M protein. Here, we characterized the structure of the N-NTD and its interaction with RNA using NMR spectroscopy. We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N-NTD lined with arginine residues suggesting a putative RNA binding site. Next, we performed an NMR titration experiment using an RNA duplex. The observed changes in positions of signals in the N-NTD NMR spectra allowed us to construct a model of the N-NTD in complex with RNA.","Dinesh, D.

It is unclear whether the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can directly infect the testes or male genital tract and be sexually transmitted from males. Methods: From January 31 to March 14, 2020, 12 patients in recovery and one patient died of COVID-19 were included in this descriptive study. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest CT scans and outcome data were recorded. To examine whether there is sexual transmission from male, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect 2019-nCov in semen or testicular biopsy specimen. Findings: The age range of the 12 patients in recovery was 22-38 years. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain due to low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required as the number of cases imported from other countries is increasing.","Lu, J.; Plessis, L. d.; Liu, Z.; Hill, V.; Kang, M.; Lin, H.; Sun, J.; Francois, S.; Kraemer, M.

568,Feasibility Study of Mitigation and Suppression Intervention Strategies for Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in London and Wuhan,"Recent outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a global pandemic cross the world. Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicentre or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR that can access effectiveness of mitigation, suppression and hybrid interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan. It extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January, 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations to 119610, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Its success heavily relied on sufficiently external support from other places of China. This mode were not suitable to other countries that have no sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a large portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. These people might think they have been healthy at home and did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak. One limitation of our model was that our prediction of infections and deaths depended on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by average number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. It assumed that each intervention had equivalent effects on the reproduction number R in different regions over time. Practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county.","Yang, P.; Qi, J.; Zhang, S.; Wang, X.; Bi, G.; Yang, Y.; Sheng, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20043794v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20043794v1?rss=1,2020-04-04,2020-04-04,,True
569,Computed Tomography Findings and Short-term follow-up with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia,"Objective: To assess the characteristics of computed tomography (CT) features and changes in CT monitoring in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) . Methods: In this retrospective, two-center study, we reviewed the medical records of 57 patients with NCP in CT from January 21 to February 12, 2020. Cases were confirmed by the results of nucleic acid test positive, and were analyzed for demographic, clinical, and CT features. Results: Of the 57 patients, 31cases were male, and 45.6% were female. The average age was 46.5 years. Patients had fever (84.2%), cough (49.1%), weak (31.6%), muscle ache (17.5%), shortness of breath (12.3%). The distribution of abnormality was a subpleural lesions in 51 cases, with 96.5% ground-glass opacity (GGO) and 68.4% consolidation. Another observation reveals 45.6% fibrosis, 33.3% lymph node enlargement, 21.1% pleural thickening, 17.5% small nodule, 7.0% white lung, 5.3% emphysema, and 3.5% bronchiectasis. Importantly, the group of men had more septal thickening and air trapping than the female group (p < 0.05); Compared with the younger, the elderly had higher of subpleural lesion, interlobular septal thickening and pleural thickening (p < 0.05). In the first monitoring, there were 37.3% improvement, 60.8% progress. In the second monitoring, there were 55% improvement, 35% progress. The improvement rate during the third follow-up visit was 100%. Conclusions: CT features and CT dynamic observation play a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment with NCP. It is conducive to early diagnosis, deepen the knowledge of NCP and accumulate experience.","Qi, S.; Guo, H.; Shao, H.; Lan, S.; He, Y.; Tiheiran, M.; Li, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20042614v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20042614v1?rss=1,2020-04-04,2020-04-04,,True
570,In-silico analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Insights from SARS encoded non-coding RNAs,"Recently a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China and has infected more than 571000 people leading to more than 26000 deaths. Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of SARS, we sought to analyze all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from SARS genome specifically focusing on non-coding RNAs. Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded miRNAs that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded miRNAs that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded miRNAs that could target the genome of both the viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared to the SARS reference genome. Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar ""GA"" rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards SARS pathology. The study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new antivirals.","Periwal, N.; Sarma, S.; Arora, P.; Sood, V.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.018499v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.018499v1?rss=1,2020-04-04,2020-04-04,,False
571,Detecting SARS-CoV-2 at point of care: Preliminary data comparing Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to PCR,"Background: The need for a fast and reliable test for COVID-19 is paramount in managing the current pandemic. A cost effective and efficient diagnostic tool as near to the point of care (PoC) as possible would be a game changer in current testing. We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 minutes, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. Methods: This service improvement project piloted a research RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents in an NHS Category 1 care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a single RT-LAMP swab compared to RT-PCR, as per STARD guidelines. We also recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information. Findings: The novel method accurately detected 8/10 PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a 'gold standard', the sensitivity and specificity of the novel test were 80% and 73% respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 73% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%. We also observed hypothermia to be a significant early clinical sign in a number of COVID-19 patients in this setting. Interpretation: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast, easy to use and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. Definitive studies to evaluate this method in larger cohorts are underway. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the point of care. This method could be deployed in mobile testing units in the community, care homes and hospitals to detect disease early and prevent spread.","Osterdahl, M. F.; Lee, K.

We observed that the combination of CQ or HCQ and metformin, which were used in our studies as potential anti-cancer drugs, killed 30-40% of mice. While our observations in mice may not translate to toxicity in humans, the reports that CQ or HCQ has anti-COVID-19 activity, the use of CQ resulting in toxicity and at least one death, and the recent Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for CQ and HCQ by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prompted our report. Here we report the lethality of CQ or HCQ in combination with metformin as a warning of its potential serious clinical toxicity. We hope that our report will be helpful to stimulate pharmacovigilance and monitoring of adverse drug reactions with the use of CQ or HCQ, particularly in combination with metformin.","Rajeshkumar, N.

573,Epigenetic dysregulation of ACE2 and interferon-regulated genes might suggest increased COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in lupus patients,"Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 can result in severe respiratory complications and death. Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF{kappa}B, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","Sawalha, A.

574,Modeling the COVID-19 outbreaks and the effectiveness of the containment measures adopted across countries,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak, originally started in China, a global pandemic. Since then, the outbreak has indeed spread across all continents, threatening the public health of numerous countries. Although the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is relatively low when optimal level of healthcare is granted to the patients, the high percentage of severe cases developing severe pneumonia and thus requiring respiratory support is worryingly high, and could lead to a rapid saturation of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). To overcome this risk, most countries enacted COVID-19 containment measures. In this study, we use a Bayesian SEIR epidemiological model to perform a parametric regression over the COVID-19 outbreaks data in China, Italy, Belgium, and Spain, and estimate the effect of the containment measures on the basic reproduction ratio R_0. We find that the effect of these measures is detectable, but tends to be gradual, and that a progressive strengthening of these measures usually reduces the R_0 below 1, granting a decay of the outbreak. We also discuss the biases and inconsistencies present in the publicly available data on COVID-19 cases, providing an estimate for the actual number of cases in Italy on March 12, 2020. Lastly, despite the data and model's limitations, we argue that the idea of ""flattening the curve"" is likely to be unfeasible.","De Brouwer, E.; Raimondi, D.; Moreau, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20046375v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20046375v1?rss=1,2020-04-04,2020-04-04,,True
575,Single-cell RNA Analysis on ACE2 Expression Provides Insight into SARS-CoV-2 Blood Entry and Heart Injury,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic with high infectivity and pathogenicity, accounting for tens of thousands of deaths worldwide. Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, shares the same cell receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) with SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 death showed that the lung had the characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide the route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. The failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2-expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 was highly expressed in cells infected by RSV or MERS-CoV and in mice treated by LPS. Our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 might attack other organs by getting into the bloodstream. This work provides new insights into SARS-CoV-2 blood entry and heart injury and might propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent patients from developing severe complications.","Guo, J.; Wei, X.; Li, Q.; Li, L.; Yang, Z.; Shi, Y.; Qin, Y.; Zhang, X.; Wang, X.; Zhi, X.; Meng, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20047621v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20047621v1?rss=1,2020-04-04,2020-04-04,,True
576,Level of IL-6 predicts respiratory failure in hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients,"The pandemic Coronavirus-disease 19 (COVID-19) is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical course. While most patients experience only mild symptoms, a relevant proportion develop severe disease progression with increasing hypoxia up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The substantial number of patients with severe disease have strained intensive care capacities to an unprecedented level. Owing to the highly variable course and lack of reliable predictors for deterioration, we aimed to identify variables that allow the prediction of patients with a high risk of respiratory failure and need of mechanical ventilation Patients with PCR proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection hospitalized at our institution from 29th February to 27th March 2020 (n=40) were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 13/40 (32.5%) did not differ in age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (p=1.2.10-5). In addition, the maximal IL-6 level (cutoff 80 pg/ml) for each patient during disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (p=1.7.10-8, AUC=0.98). The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of [&ge;] 80 pg/ml was 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels. In the current situation with overwhelmed intensive care units and overcrowded emergency rooms, correct triage of patients in need of intensive care is crucial. Our study shows that IL-6 is an effective marker that might be able to predict upcoming respiratory failure with high accuracy and help physicians correctly allocate patients at an early stage.","Herold, T.; Jurinovic, V.; Arnreich, C.; Hellmuth, J.

577,Countrywide quarantine only mildly increased anxiety level during COVID-19 outbreak in China,"In the recent outbreak of COVID-19, many countries have taken various kinds of quarantine measures to slow down the explosive spreading of COVID-19. Although these measures were proven to be successful in stopping the outbreak in China, the potential adverse effects of countrywide quarantine have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we performed an online survey to evaluate the psychological effects of quarantine in China using Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale in February 2020 when the outbreak was nearly peaked in China. Along with the anxiety scores, limited personal information such as age, gender, region, education, occupation and specifically, the type and duration of quarantine were collected for analysis. For a total number of 992 valid questionnaires, clinical significance of anxiety symptoms was observed in 9.58% respondents according to clinical diagnostic standards in China. Statistical results showed population with different age, education level, health status and personnel category responded differently. Other characteristics such as gender, marital status, region, and acquaintance with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 did not affect anxiety levels significantly. Respondents experienced different forms of quarantine showed different anxiety levels. Unexpectedly, longer durations of quarantine did not lead to significant increase of anxiety level. Our results suggest a rather mild negative psychological influence caused by the countrywide quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak in China and provided reference for other countries and regions to battle COVID-19.","Hu, W.; Su, L.; Qiao, J.; Zhu, J.; Zhou, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20041186v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20041186v1?rss=1,2020-04-04,2020-04-04,,True
578,Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Usage is Associated with Improved Inflammatory Status and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients With Hypertension,"With the capability of inducing elevated expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs/ACEIs) treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the correlation of ARBs/ACEIs usage with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study. 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008). Furthermore, much lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.","Yang, G.; Tan, Z.; Zhou, L.; Yang, M.; Peng, L.; Liu, J.; Cai, J.; Yang, R.; Han, J.; Huang, Y.; He, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20038935v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20038935v1?rss=1,2020-04-04,2020-04-04,,True
579,A Mini Review on Current Clinical and Research Findings for Children Suffering from COVID-19,"Background: As the novel coronavirus triggering COVID-19 has broken out in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly worldwide, it threatens the lives of thousands of people and poses a global threat on the economies of the entire world. However, infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. Objective To discuss the latest findings and research focus on the basis of characteristics of children confirmed with COVID-19, and provide an insight into the future treatment and research direction. Methods: We searched the terms ""COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""Pediatric OR children"" on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, NIH, CDC, and CNKI. The authors also reviewed the guidelines published on Chinese CDC and Chinese NHC. Results: We included 25 published literature references related to the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, accessary examination, treatment, and prognosis of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The numbers of children with COVID-19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic, which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, and plain chest X-ray do not usually show the lesions or the detailed features. Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic detection is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and/or; lactate progressively increasing and/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or blood-purifying therapy should be given in time. Furthermore, effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely.","Li, X.; Qian, K.; Xie, L.-l.; Li, X.-j.; Cheng, M.; Jiang, L.; Schuller, B.

580,Reply to Gautret et al. 2020: A Bayesian reanalysis of the effects of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on viral carriage in patients with COVID-19,"Gautret and colleagues reported results of a non-randomised open-label case series which examined the effects of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on viral load in the upper respiratory tract of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients. The authors report that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had significant virus reducing effects, and that dual treatment of both HCQ and azithromycin further enhanced virus reduction. This data has triggered speculation whether these drugs should be considered as candidates for the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, questions have been raised regarding the study's data integrity, statistical analyses, and experimental design. We therefore reanalysed the original data to interrogate the main claims of the paper. Here we apply Bayesian statistics to assess the robustness of the original papers claims by testing four variants of the data: 1) The original data; 2) Data including patients who deteriorated; 3) Data including patients who deteriorated with exclusion of untested patients in the comparison group; 4) Data that includes patients who deteriorated with the assumption that untested patients were negative. To ask if HCQ monotherapy is effective, we performed an A/B test for a model which assumes a positive effect, compared to a model of no effect. We find that the statistical evidence is highly sensitive to these data variants. Statistical evidence for the positive effect model ranged from strong for the original data (BF ~11), to moderate when including patients who deteriorated (BF ~4.35), to anecdotal when excluding untested patients (BF ~2), and to anecdotal negative evidence if untested patients were assumed positive (BF ~0.6). To assess whether HCQ is more effective when combined with AZ, we performed the same tests, and found only anecdotal evidence for the positive effect model for the original data (BF ~2.8), and moderate evidence for all other variants of the data (BF ~5.6). Our analyses only explore the effects of different assumptions about excluded and untested patients. These assumptions are not adequately reported, nor are they justified in the original paper, and we find that varying them causes substantive changes to the evidential support for the main claims of the original paper. This statistical uncertainty is exacerbated by the fact that the treatments were not randomised, and subject to several confounding variables including the patients' consent to treatment, different care centres, and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, while the viral load measurements were noisy, showing multiple reversals between test outcomes, there is greater certainty around other clinical outcomes such as the 4 patients who seriously deteriorated. The fact that all of these belonged to the HCQ monotherapy group should be assigned greater weight when evaluating the potential clinical efficacy of HCQ. Randomised controlled trials are currently underway, and will be critical in resolving this uncertainty as to whether HCQ and AZ are effective as a treatment for COVID-19.","Hulme, O.

The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under these circumstances, where the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, we had recruited a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years. About 85% reported practising the social distancing recommended by the government. More females than males and more older than younger participants are supportive of practicing social distancing. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all, 92 percent of female and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23%). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60% of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50%. However, the results also showed that about 20% of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, with a drinking or smoking habit and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral changes using various means to reach and influence them.","Muto, K.; Yamamoto, I.; Nagasu, M.; Tanaka, M.; Wada, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048876v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048876v1?rss=1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,,True
583,"Clinical features, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review of case reports and case series","Objectives: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a public health emergency worldwide. The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a structured search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up to February 30, 2020. Results: Thirty-four articles were included analyzing a total of 99 patients with a mean age of 46.2 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was fever, reported in up to 83% of patients from 76.4% of the analyzed studies. Other symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally, in studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (33%). CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (71.0%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included, lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor). Conclusions: Development of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for presence and severity of disease. There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19. Further prospective investigations are necessary.","Tahvildari, A.; Arbabi, M.; Farsi, Y.; Jamshidi, P.; Hasanzadeh, S.; Calcagno, T. M.; Nasiri, M.

Here we evaluate how a suit of 15 climatic and socio-economic variables influence COVID-19 exponential growth-phase infection and mortality rates across 36 countries. We found that imports of goods and services, international tourism and the number of published scientific papers are good predictors of COVID-19 infection rates, indicating that more globalized countries may have experienced multiple and recurrent introductions of the virus. However, high-income countries showed lower mortality rates, suggesting that the consequences of the current pandemia will be worse for globalized low-income countries. International aid agencies could use this information to help mitigate the consequences of the current pandemia in the most vulnerable countries.","Jaffe, R.; Ortiz Vera, M.

585,SEIR and Regression Model based COVID-19 outbreak predictions in India,"COVID-19 pandemic has become a major threat to the country. Till date, well tested medication or antidote is not available to cure this disease. According to WHO reports, COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30th January 2020 to 30th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02. Expected cases may rise between 5000-6000 in the next two weeks of time. This study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the next two weeks. Based on the predictions for short-term interval, these models can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals.","Gupta, R.; Pandey, G.; Chaudhary, P.; Pal, S.

586,Harmonizing heterogeneous endpoints in COVID-19 trials without loss of information - an essential step to facilitate decision making,"Background: Many trials are now underway to inform decision-makers on potential effects of treatments for COVID-19. To provide sufficient information for all involved decision-makers (clinicians, public health authorities, drug regulatory agencies) a multiplicity of endpoints must be considered. It is a challenge to generate detailed high quality evidence from data while ensuring fast availability and evaluation of the results. Methods: We reviewed all interventional COVID-19 trials on Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine registered in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and summarized the endpoints used to assess treatment effects. We propose a multistate model that harmonizes heterogeneous endpoints and differing lengths of follow-up within and between trials. Results: There are currently, March 27, 2020, 23 registered interventional trials investigating the potential benefits of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine. The endpoints are highly heterogeneous. Follow-up for the primary endpoints ranges from four to 168 days. A detailed precisely defined endpoint has been proposed by the global network REMAP-CAP, which is specialized on community-acquired pneumonia. Their seven-category endpoint accounts for major clinical events informative for all decision-makers. Moreover, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative is currently working on a core outcome set. We propose a multistate model that accommodates analysis of these recommended endpoints. The model allows for a detailed investigation of treatment effects for various endpoints over the course of time thereby harmonizing differing endpoints and lengths of follow-up. Conclusion: Multistate model analysis is a powerful tool to study clinically heterogeneous endpoints (mortality, discharge) as well as endpoints influencing hospital capacities (duration of hospitalization and ventilation) simultaneously over time. Our proposed model extracts all information available in the data and is - by harmonizing endpoints within and between trials - a step towards faster decision making. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death.","von Cube, M.; Grodd, M.; Wolkewitz, M.; Hazard, D.; Lambert, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049007v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049007v1?rss=1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,,True
587,"Spatial variability in the risk of death from COVID-19 in Italy, 2020","Background: Italy is bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the death toll there has already surpassed that in Wuhan, the city in China where the coronavirus emerged in December 2019. Here we employ statistical methods to assess the severity of COVID-19 pandemic across different regions of Italy. Method: We manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 stratified by region in Italy from March 2, 2020 to March 28, 2020. We estimated both the crude and time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio across five geographic regions of Italy: Northwest, Northeast, Center, South and Island. Results: The Northwest that includes Lombardy exhibited the highest time-delay-adjusted CFR at 31.4%% [95% credible interval: 30.8, 32.1%] followed by the Northeast (20.3%) [95% CrI: 19.4, 21.1], the Center region (16.5%) [95% CrI: 15.4, 17.7] and the South region (16.8%) [95% CrI: 15.0, 18.7]. The Island region has exhibited the lowest CFR (11.8%) [95% CrI: 9.0, 14.8]. Conclusion: Italy is experiencing one of the highest CFR from the COVID-19 pandemic in the world. Time delay adjusted CFR in all the regions in Italy except the Island region were higher than that estimated for Wuhan, China. The CFR in Northwest Italy is 2.5-fold higher than that in Wuhan. Our finding reflects the need of urgent medical support in the Northwest region and the appropriate planning and supplies procurement in other regions of Italy with focus on medical care delivery to those who are at the highest risk of poorer outcomes due to COVID-19.","Mizumoto, K.; Dahal, S.; Chowell, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049668v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049668v1?rss=1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,,True
588,In silico approach for designing of a multi-epitope based vaccine against novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2),"A novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) has now become a global pandemic. Considering the severity of infection and the associated mortalities, there is an urgent need to develop an effective preventive measure against this virus. In this study, we have designed a novel vaccine construct using computational strategies. Spike (S) glycoprotein is the major antigenic component that trigger the host immune responses. Detailed investigation of S protein with various immunoinformatics tools enabled us to identify 5 MHC I and 5 MHC II B-cell derived T-cell epitopes with VaxiJen score > 1 and IC50 value < 100nM. These epitopes were joined with a suitable adjuvant and appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope based vaccine construct. Further, in silico testing of the vaccine construct for its antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and other physicochemical properties showed it to be safe and immunogenic. Suitable tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was generated using 3Dpro of SCRATCH suite, refined with GalaxyRefine, and validated with ProSA, PROCHECK, and ERRAT server. Finally, molecular docking studies were performed to ensure a favorable binding affinity between the vaccine construct and TLR3 receptor. The designed multi-epitope vaccine showed potential to elicit specific immune responses against the SARS-COV-2. However, further wet lab validation is necessary to confirm the actual effectiveness, safety and immunogenic potency of the vaccine construct against derived in this study.","Saha, R.; Prasad, B.

Previous studies suggested cat could be a potential susceptible animal of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cats by detecting specific serum antibodies. A cohort of serum samples were collected from cats in Wuhan, including 102 sampled after COVID-19 outbreak, and 39 prior to the outbreak. 15 of 102 (14.7%) cat sera collected after the outbreak were positive for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 by indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the positive samples, 11 had SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with a titer ranging from 1/20 to 1/1080. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between the SARS-CoV-2 and type I or II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV).

590,The protein expression profile of ACE2 in human tissues,"The international spread of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global challenge on both healthcare and society. A multitude of research efforts worldwide aim at characterizing the cellular factors involved in viral transmission in order to reveal therapeutic targets. For a full understanding of the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cell type-specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is necessary. The key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and its expression has been reported in various human organs, in some cases with inconsistent or contradictory results. Here, we aim to verify a reliable expression profile of ACE2 in all major human tissues and cell types. Based on stringently validated immunohistochemical analysis and high-throughput mRNA sequencing from several datasets, we found that ACE2 expression is mainly localized to microvilli of the intestinal tract and renal proximal tubules, gallbladder epithelium, testicular Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, glandular cells of seminal vesicle and cardiomyocytes. The expression in several other previously reported locations, including alveolar type II (AT2) cells, could not be confirmed. Furthermore, ACE2 expression was absent in the AT2 lung carcinoma cell line A549, often used as a model for viral replication studies. Our analysis suggests that the expression of ACE2 in the human respiratory system appears to be limited, and the expression of the receptor in lung or respiratory epithelia on the protein level is yet to be confirmed. This raises questions regarding the role of ACE2 for infection of human lungs and highlights the need to further explore the route of transmission during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hikmet, F.; Mear, L.; Uhlen, M.; Lindskog, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.016048v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.016048v1?rss=1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,,False
591,Deducing the N- and O- glycosylation profile of the spike protein of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"The current emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 demands the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent rapid progress of mortalities. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O-glycosylation is strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research towards the development of a suitable vaccine candidate.","Shajahan, A.; Supekar, N.

592,"Structural basis to design multi-epitope vaccines against Novel Coronavirus 19 (COVID19) infection, the ongoing pandemic emergency: an in silico approach","The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID19 / Wuhan coronavirus), officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 causes the contagious COVID19 disease also known as 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease and has led to the ongoing 2019-20 pandemic COVID19 outbreak. The effective countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 infection requires the design and development of specific and effective vaccine candidate. In the present study we have screened 38 CTL, 42 HTL and 12 B cell epitopes by utilizing different in silico tools. The screened epitopes were further validated for their binding with their respective HLA allele binders and TAP (Transporter associated with antigen processing) molecule by molecular docking. The screened epitopes were further utilized to design novel two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) composed of CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes overlaps with potential to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2. To enhance the immune response for our vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) has been utilized as an adjuvant at N terminal of both the MEVs. Further molecular models for both the MEVs were prepared and validated for their stable molecular interaction with Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR 3). The codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs were further analyzed for their potential of high level of expression in Human cell line. The present study proposes in-silico validated design of two MEVs against SARS-CoV-2 to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune response.

593,Evaluation of the Anticipated Burden of COVID-19 on Hospital-Based Healthcare Services Across the United States,"Background: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic, with the potential to infect nearly 60% of the population. The anticipated spread of the virus requires an urgent appraisal of the capacity of US healthcare services and the identification of states most vulnerable to exceeding their capacity Methods: In the American Hospital Association survey for 2018, a database of US community hospitals, we identified total inpatient beds, adult intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and airborne isolation rooms across all hospitals in each state of continental US. The burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations was estimated based on a median hospitalization duration of 12 days and was evaluated for a 30-day reporting period. Results: At 5155 US community hospitals across 48 states in the contiguous US and Washington DC, there were a total of 788,032 inpatient beds, 68,280 adult ICU beds, and 44,222 isolation rooms. The median daily bed occupancy was 62.8% (IQR 58.1%, 66.6%) across states. Nationally, for every 10,000 individuals, there are 24.2 inpatient beds, 2.8 adult ICU beds, and 1.4 isolation beds. There is a 3-fold variation in the number of inpatient beds available across the US, ranging from 16.4 per 10,000 in Oregon to 47 per 10,000 in South Dakota. There was also a similar 3-fold variation in available or non-occupied beds, ranging from 4.7 per 10,000 in Connecticut through 18.3 per 10,000 in North Dakota. The availability of ICU beds is low nationally, ranging from 1.4 per 10,000 in Nevada to 4.7 per 10000 in Washington DC. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in a median 0.2% (IQR 0.2 %, 0.3%) of state population, or 1.4% of state's older adults (1.0%, 1.9%) will require all non-occupied beds. Further, a median 0.6% (0.5%, 0.8%) of state population, or 3.9% (3.1%, 4.6%) of older individuals would require 100% of inpatient beds. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to overwhelm the limited number of inpatient and ICU beds for the US population. Hospitals in half of US states would exceed capacity if less than 0.2% of the state population requires hospitalization in any given month.","Khera, R.; Jain, S.; Lin, Z.; Ross, J.

594,The Spike Protein S1 Subunit of SARS-CoV-2 Contains an LxxIxE-like Motif that is Known to Recruit the Host PP2A-B56 Phosphatase,"The novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and can cause serious acute respiratory illness syndromes, often fatal, called covid-19. It is an urgent priority to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms that will help in the development of prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics that are very important to people health and socioeconomic stability around the world. The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane fusion. Here the analysis of CoV-2 S protein revealed in S1subunit a B56-binding LxxIxE-like motif that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This motif is absent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. PP2A is a major family of serine/threonine phosphatases in eukaryotic cells. Phosphatases and kinases are big players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses use multiple strategies to target PP2A in order to manipulate hosts antiviral responses. The latest studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained inflammation in the host. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation; it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight covid-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a target for the development of a bioactive peptide and ligand inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.","Maaroufi, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.020941v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.020941v1?rss=1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,,False

Other than the infected general population, infected pregnant women reported different symptoms; however, fever (66.7%), cough (39.4%), fatigue (15.2%), and breathing difficulties (14.1%) were common. Infected pregnant women were given different treatments than the general infected population. The C-section was a common (83.9%) mode of delivery among infected pregnant women, and a higher proportion of births were preterm births (30.4%) and low birth weight (17.9%). Conclusions: Pregnant infected women had different symptoms, and they were given dissimilar treatments than the general infected population. Healthcare providers may have appropriately informed about these symptoms and treatments. They, therefore, would be able to handle infection during pregnancy effectively, which would reduce common adverse consequences among infected pregnant women.","Khan, M. M. A.; Khan, M.

597,A flexible load sharing system and implementation to anticipate and organise transfers based on ICU demand in the context of COVID-19 pandemic,"As the number of cases of COVID-19 continues to grow exponentially, local health services are likely to be overwhelmed with patients requiring intensive care. We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) between hospitals within NHS trusts, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We coarse-grain the NHS system at the level of NHS trusts and, subsequently cover the whole set of geopositioned trusts to extract a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates, for a given trust, its four nearest neighbors. Estimates of weekly ICU demand can be extrapolated from an age structured epidemiological model by considering contagion-to-ICU likelihood estimates, and through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy. The cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity and we implement and test two optimisation strategies. Our framework is flexible allowing for additional criteria, different cost functions, and this methodology is general enough that it can easily be extended to optimise other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand across trusts, we show that using our method it is possible to enable access to ICU treatment to up to 1000 cases nationally in a single step of the algorithm, leading to potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU if no load sharing was implemented.","Lacasa, L.; Challen, R.; Brooks-Pollock, E.; Danon, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049239v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049239v1?rss=1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,,True
598,Simple model for Covid-19 epidemics - back-casting in China and forecasting in the US,"In our previous work, we analyze, in near-real time, evolution of Covid-19 epidemic in China for the first 22 days of reliable data (up to February 6, 2020). In this work, we used the data for the whole 87 days (up to March 13, 2020) in China and the US data available till March 31 (day 70) for systematic evaluation of the logistic model to predict epidemic growth. We sequentially estimated sets of model parameters (maximum number of cases K, growth rate r, and half-time t0) and the epidemic ""end time"" t95 (defined as the time when the number of cases, predicted or actual, reached 95% of the maximum). The estimates of these parameters were done for sequences of reported cases growing daily (back-casting for China and forecasting for the US). In both countries, the estimates of K grew very much in time during the exponential and nearly exponential phases making longer term forecasting not reliable. For the US, the current estimate of the maximum number of cases K is about 265,000 but it is very likely that it will grow in the future. However, running estimates of the ""end time"" t95 were in a much smaller interval for China (60 - 70 days vs. the actual value of 67). For the US, the values estimated from the data sequences going back two weeks from now range from 70 to 80 days. If the behavior of the US epidemic is similar to the previous Chinese development, the number of reported cases could reach a maximum around April 10 to 14.","Hermanowicz, S.

Similar results are expected to hold for other countries, though some minor adaption will be required based on local age demographics and hospital facilities.","Jamieson-Lane, A.

600,Knowledge and Beliefs towards Universal Safety Precautions to flatten the curve during Novel Coronavirus Disease (nCOVID-19) Pandemic among general Public in India: Explorations from a National Perspective,"Background: The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is being considered as the most serious health threat that the world has never witnessed in the recent times and significantly affecting the daily routine of mankind by emerging as a global pandemic. Yet, as there is no treatment nor a vaccine that was approved so far, universal safety precautions (USPs) and mitigating strategies are the only way to deal with this emergency crisis. However, knowledge and beliefs towards USPs among the general public in countries such as India with a large population are lacking. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, web-based online survey was conducted among the general public in India during March 2020. A 20-items self-administered survey questionnaire was developed and randomly distributed among the public using google document forms through social media networks. Descriptive statistics were used in representing the study characteristics, and the Chi-square test was used in assessing the associations among the study variables with a p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Of 1287 participants, 1117 have given their consent of willingness and completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 86.8%. The mean age of the study participants was 28.8 {+/-} 10.9 years, where the majority of them belong to the age category <25 years, and sex was equally distributed. Based upon the socio-demographic information, the majority were post-graduates (32.9%), professional job holders (45%) and belonged to the upper-middle (40%) economic class. Overall, the knowledge and beliefs towards USPs and mitigating strategies among participants varied between moderate to high, with statistically significant associations with their socio-demographic characteristics. Conclusions: Although the knowledge and beliefs of the general public in India towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 have been changing day-by-day rapidly. The findings of this study could guide the public health authorities in making and implementing decisions to combat this pandemic.

601,Use of siltuximab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilatory support,"COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SAR-CoV-2), resulting in symptoms, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has also been suggested to initiate a cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 evidenced by elevated cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). We report preliminary data from 21 patients with COVID-19 who developed pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and participated in a compassionate-use program at Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo, Italy. All 21 patients received intravenous siltuximab, a chimeric mAb that binds to and blocks the effect of IL-6, at a dose ranging between 700 to 1,200 mg (median 900 mg). The median age of patients treated was 64 years, and all patients were followed for a median of eight days. Serum CRP levels reduced in all 16 patients with available data following treatment. An improvement in the clinical condition was observed in 33% (7/21) of patients, 43% (9/21) of patients stabilized as evidenced by no clinically relevant change in their condition, and 24% (5/21) experienced a worsening in their condition. Of those patients who experienced a worsening in their condition, one patient died, and one patient experienced a cerebrovascular event. This analysis is presented to inform the medical community of the potential role of siltuximab in treating patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a cohort study with patients treated with standard therapy in our hospital is ongoing, and will report the 30-day mortality rates upon completion.","Gritti, G.; Raimondi, F.; Ripamonti, D.; Riva, I.; Landi, F.; Alborghetti, L.; Frigeni, M.; Damiani, M.; Mico, C.; Fagiuoli, S.; Cosentini, R.; Luca Lorini, F.; Fabretti, F.; Morgan, J.; Owens, B.

602,Perceptions and behavioural responses of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey of UK Adults,"Objective: To examine risk perceptions and behavioural responses of the UK adult population during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK. Design: A cross-sectional survey Setting: Conducted with a nationally representative sample of UK adults within 48 hours of the UK Government advising the public to stop non-essential contact with others and all unnecessary travel. Participants: 2,108 adults living in the UK aged 18 years and over. Data were collected between March 17 and 18 2020. Main outcome measures: Descriptive statistics for all survey questions, including the number of respondents and the weighted percentages. Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic variation in: (1) adoption of social-distancing measures, (2) ability to work from home, and (3) willingness and (4) ability to self-isolate. Results Overall, 1,992 (94.2%) respondents reported taking at least one preventive measure: 85.8% washed their hands with soap more frequently; 56.5% avoided crowded areas and 54.5% avoided social events. Adoption of social-distancing measures was higher in those aged over 70 compared to younger adults aged 18 to 34 years (aOR:1.9; 95% CI:1.1 to 3.4). Those with the lowest household income were six times less likely to be able to work from home (aOR:0.16; 95% CI:0.09 to 0.26) and three times less likely to be able to self-isolate (aOR:0.31; 95% CI:0.16 to 0.58). Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aOR:0.47; 95% CI:0.27 to 0.82). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all respondents. Conclusions The ability to adopt and comply with certain NPIs is lower in the most economically disadvantaged in society. Governments must implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. By incorporating these differences in NPIs among socio-economic subpopulations into mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, our modelling of epidemic outcomes and response to COVID-19 can be improved.","Atchison, C.

Basic predictions for the evolution of the disease expansion are made for selected countries with a stable evolution in the parametric space of the model.

604,Intervention Serology and Interaction Substitution: Modeling the Role of 'Shield Immunity' in Reducing COVID-19 Epidemic Spread,"The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 690,000 confirmed cases and more than 33,000 confirmed deaths globally as of March 30, 2020 [1-4]. At present two central public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5]). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are no longer shedding virus [8]. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well recognized roles in estimating prevalence [10, 11] and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies [12-15].","Weitz, J.

606,Modelling the COVID-19 epidemics in Brasil: Parametric identification and public health measures influence,"A SIRU-type epidemic model is proposed for the prediction of COVID-19 spreading within Brasil, and analyse the influence of public health measures on simulating the control of this infectious disease. Since the reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, the model accounts for both reported and unreported cases. Also, the model allows for the time variation of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, so as to reflect public health interventions, towards its control, along the course of the epidemic evolution. An analytical exponential behaviour for the accumulated reported cases evolution is assumed at the onset of the epidemy, for explicitly estimating initial conditions, while a Bayesian inference approach is adopted for parametric estimations employing the present direct problem model with the data from the known portion of the epidemics evolution, represented by the time series for the reported cases of infected individuals. The direct-inverse problem analysis is then employed with the actual data from China, with the first half been employed for the parametric estimation and the second half for validation of the predictive capability of the proposed approach. The full dataset for China is then employed in another parameter identification, including the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals are infectious. Following this validation, the available data on reported cases in Brasil from February 15th till March 29th, 2020, is used for estimating parameters and then predict the epidemy evolution under these conditions. Finally, public health interventions are simulated, aimed at diminishing the effects of the disease spreading, by acting on both the transmission rate and the fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, considering time variable exponential behaviours for these two parameters, usually assumed constant in epidemic evolutions without intervention. It is demonstrated that a combination of actions to affect both parameters can have a much faster and effective result in the control of the epidemy dynamics.","Cotta, R. M.; Naveira-Cotta, C.

607,Quantifying the impact of physical distance measures on the transmission of COVID-19 in the UK,"Background: To mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies, including the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). Methods: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a ""lockdown"" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the lockdown to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. Findings: We found a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only. Interpretation: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.","Jarvis, C.

608,Interleukin-6 in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Purpose: Coronaviruses may activate dysregulated host immune responses. As exploratory studies have suggested that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in cases of complicated COVID-19 and that the anti-IL-6 biologic tocilizumab may be beneficial, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence in this field. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies investigating the immunological response in COVID-19 or its treatment with tocilizumab; additional grey literature searches were undertaken. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random effects models. Results: Eight published studies, three pre-prints, and five registered trials were eligible. Meta-analysis of mean IL-6 concentrations demonstrated 2.9-fold higher levels in patients with complicated COVID-19 compared with patients with non-complicated disease (six studies; n=1302; 95%CI, 1.17-7.19; I2=100%). A single non-randomized, single-arm study assessed tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19, demonstrating decreased oxygen requirements, resolution of radiographic abnormalities, and clinical improvement. No adverse events or deaths were observed. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. While inhibition of IL-6 with tocilizumab appears to be efficacious and safe in preliminary investigation, the results of several ongoing clinical trials should be awaited to better define the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 prior to routine clinical application.","Coomes, E.

610,Using ILI surveillance to estimate state-specific case detection rates and forecast SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections to date has relied on RT-PCR testing. However, a failure to identify early cases imported to a country, bottlenecks in RT-PCR testing, and the existence of infections which are asymptomatic, sub-clinical, or with an alternative presentation than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the syndromic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be approximately 1 our of 100. This corresponds to at least 28 million presumed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients across the US during the three week period from March 8 to March 28. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to be doubling slower than every 3.5 days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID epidemic in the US in which rapid spread across the US are combined with a large population of infected patients with presumably mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data, and discuss the broader potential to use syndromic time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.","Silverman, J.

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of various meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19. Methods: Taking Hubei province of China as an example,where COVID-19 was first reported and there were the most cases, we collected 53 days of cases up to March 10(total 67773 confirmed cases).COVID-19 confirmed cases were retrieved from the official website of Hubei Health Commission. Ten meteorological parameters were provided by China meteorological administration,including average pressure (hPa), average temperature ({degrees}C) , maximum temperature, minimum temperature ({degrees}C), average water vapor pressure (hPa), average relative humidity (%),etc.Cross correlation analysis and linear regression were used to judge the relationship of meteorological factors and increment of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Results: Under 95% CI, the increment of confirmed cases in Hubei were significantly correlated with four meteorological parameters of average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure (equivalent to absolute humidity).The average pressure was positively correlated with the increment (r=+0.358,p=0.010).The negative correlations included average temperature (r=-0.306,p=0.029), minimum air temperature (r=-0.347,p=0.013), average water vapor pressure (r=-0.326,p=0.020). The linear regression results show if minimum temperature increases by 1{degrees}C, the incremental confirmed cases in Hubei decreases by 72.470 units on average. Conclusion: The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly correlated with average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure. It is positively correlated with the average pressure and negatively correlated with the other three parameters. Compared with relative humidity, 2019-nCov is more sensitive to water vapor pressure. The reason why the epidemic situation in Hubei expanded rapidly is significantly related to the climate characteristics of low temperature and dryness of Hubei in winter.","Li, J.; Zhang, L.; Ren, Z.; Xing, C.; Qiao, P.; Chang, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050526v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050526v1?rss=1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,,True

The entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), followed by its priming by the TMPRSS2 serine protease, both present on the cellular membrane of the target cells. In the respiratory tract, these targets are ciliated cells. Interestingly, various reports indicate an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anosmia, suggesting an alteration not restricted to the respiratory tissue, but that might also include the olfactory sensory epithelium. We explored this possibility by generating RNA-seq libraries from human neuroepithelium, in which we found significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. To determine whether specific cell types of this chemosensory tissue may coexpress both of the virus entry genes, we analyzed a scRNA-seq dataset. We determined that sustentacular cells, which are in direct contact with the external world and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, represents a prime candidate for SARS-CoV-2 infection via the nose, and possibly for SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia.","Fodoulian, L.; Tuberosa, J.; Rossier, D.; Landis, B.; Carleton, A.; Rodriguez, I.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.013268v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.013268v1?rss=1,2020-04-02,2020-04-02,,False
613,Virus-host interactome and proteomic survey of PMBCs from COVID-19 patients reveal potential virulence factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis,"The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global public health concern due to relatively easy person-to-person transmission and the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-[Kcy]B repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Our integrative study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.","Liang, Q.; Li, J.; Guo, M.; Tian, X.; Liu, C.; Wang, X.; Yang, X.; Wu, P.; Xiao, Z.; Qu, Y.; Yin, Y.; Fu, J.; Zhu, Z.; Liu, Z.; Peng, C.; Zhu, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.019216v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.019216v1?rss=1,2020-04-02,2020-04-02,,False

This demands novel research on the vaccine to fight against this pandemic situation, re-purposing of the existing drugs, phylogenetic analysis to identify the origin and determine the similarity with other known viruses, etc. The very preliminary task from the research community is to analyze the wide verities of existing related research articles, which is very much time-consuming in such situations where each minute counts for saving hundreds of human lives. The entire manual processing is even lower down the efficiency in mining the information. We have developed a complete automatic literature mining system that delivers efficient and fast mining from existing biomedical literature databases.

615,A SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Strategy Focused on Population-Scale Immunity,"Here we propose a vaccination strategy for SARS-CoV-2 based on identification of both highly conserved regions of the virus and newly acquired adaptations that are presented by MHC class I and II across the vast majority of the population, are highly dissimilar from the human proteome, and are predicted B cell epitopes. We present 65 peptide sequences that we expect to result in a safe and effective vaccine which can be rapidly tested in DNA, mRNA, or synthetic peptide constructs. These include epitopes that are contained within evolutionarily divergent regions of the spike protein reported to increase infectivity through increased binding to the ACE2 receptor, and within a novel furin cleavage site thought to increase membrane fusion. This vaccination strategy specifically targets unique vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and should engage a robust adaptive immune response in the vast majority of the human population.","Yarmarkovich, M.; Warrington, J.

616,Characterization and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal and bronchial human airway epithelia,"In the current COVID-19 pandemic context, proposing and validating effective treatments represents a major challenge. However, the lack of biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental models of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a complement of classic cell lines represents a major barrier for scientific and medical progress. Here, we advantageously used human reconstituted airway epithelial models of nasal or bronchial origin to characterize viral infection kinetics, tissue-level remodeling of the cellular ultrastructure and transcriptional immune signatures induced by SARS-CoV-2. Our results underline the relevance of this model for the preclinical evaluation of antiviral candidates. Foremost, we provide evidence on the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir and the therapeutic potential of the remdesivir-diltiazem combination as a rapidly available option to respond to the current unmet medical need imposed by COVID-19.

617,Insights into The Codon Usage Bias of 13 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Isolates from Different Geo-locations,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is an infectious disease that spread throughout the world and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the present study, we analyzed genome-wide codon usage patterns in 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geo-locations (countries) by utilizing different CUB measurements. Nucleotide and di-nucleotide compositions displayed bias toward A/U content in all codon positions and CpU-ended codons preference, respectively. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) analysis revealed 8 common putative preferred codons among all the 13 isolates. Interestingly, all of the latter codons are A/U-ended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1). Cluster analysis (based on RSCU values) was performed and showed comparable results to the phylogenetic analysis (based on their whole genome sequences) indicating that the CUB pattern may reflect the evolutionary relationship between the tested isolates. To investigate the force (mutation and/or selection) influencing the pattern of CUB in SARS-CoV-2 coding sequences, we employed the following; (i). Effective number of codons (ENc), (ii). ENc-GC3 plot, (iii). Neutrality plot, and (iv) Codon adaptation index (CAI). According to their results, natural selection and/or other factors (not investigated in this study) may be the dominant force driving SARS-CoV-2 CUB. It is also worth mentioning that, by using the most expressed genes in human lung tissues as a reference set, some viral genes such as Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, ORF7a protein, and surface glycoprotein had high CAI values which may indicate for selection force acting on their codon usage, as they play important roles in viral assembly and may help viruses avoid the host immune system. The outcome of our study may help in understanding the underlying factors involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the interactions with their host. Also, it may aid in vaccine design strategies.","Anwar, A. M.; Khodary, S.

618,Identification of a common deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,"Two notable features have been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (1) the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2; (2) a unique insertion of twelve nucleotide or four amino acids (PRRA) at the S1 and S2 boundary. For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human. The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2 requires further work. Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution. The deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development.","Liu, Z.; Zheng, H.; Yuan, R.; Li, M.; Lin, H.; Peng, J.; Xiong, Q.; Sun, J.; Li, B.; Wu, J.; Ke, C.; Hulswit, R.

619,Knowledge and behaviors toward COVID-19 among U.S. residents during the early days of the pandemic,"Abstract Objective: To test the hypothesis that knowledge of COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. Methods: Cross-sectional online survey of 1,034 U.S. residents age 18+ conducted on March 17, 2020. Results: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (OR=0.88, 95% CI:0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR=0.87, 95%CI: 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR=0.56, 95% CI:0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and Millennial participants had 56% to 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior, compared to Baby Boomers. Results suggest politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR=0.70, 95% CI:0.50-0.97), and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR=0.52, 95% CI:0.34-0.78), compared to Republicans. Conclusions: This survey is one of the first attempts to study determinants of knowledge and behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. A national, coordinated effort at pandemic response may ensure better compliance with behavioral recommendations to address this public health emergency.","Clements, J.

620,Monitoring trends and differences in COVID-19 case fatality rates using decomposition methods: Contributions of age structure and age-specific fatality,"The population-level case fatality rate (CFR) associated with COVID-19 varies substantially, both across countries and within countries over time. We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and the United States. We calculate the CFR for each country at the latest data point and for Italy also over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. CFRs vary from 0.7% in Germany and 1.6% in South Korea to 8.6% in Spain and 10.6% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases can explain a substantial proportion of cross-country variation in the CFR. For example, 57% of Spain's difference with respect to South Korea is explained by the observed cases being older. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 10.6% between March 9 and March 29, 2020, and more than 95% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of infected cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case fatality rates indicate the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.","Dudel, C.; Riffe, T.; Acosta, E.; van Raalte, A.

622,Importance of suppression and mitigation measures in managing COVID-19 outbreaks,"I employ a simple mathematical model of an epidemic process to evaluate how three basic quantities: the reproduction number (R), the number of infectious individuals (I), and total community size (N) affect strategies to control COVID-19. Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results on short-term strategies point to either a two-step control strategy, following failed mitigation, that begins with suppression of the reproduction number, Rc, below 1.0, followed by renewed mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining Rc at approximately 1.0, or should suppression not be feasible, a progressive lowering of Rc below 1.0. The full sequence of measures that we are observing in a number of countries, and likely to see in the longer term, can be symbolically represented as: R0 [-&gt;] Rc<R0 [-&gt;] Rc<<1.0 [-&gt;] Rc{approx}1.0 [-&gt;] Rc<1.0.

623,ACE2 and TMPRSS2 variants and expression as candidates to sex and country differences in COVID-19 severity in Italy,"Background: As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, prognostic markers for early identification of high-risk individuals are an urgent medical need. Italy has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19 among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, which are crucial for viral infection. Methods: Exome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the country's population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression. Results: While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity/sex bias in the Italian population, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, contributing to the observed epidemiological data among Italian patients. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a role for TMPRSS2 variants and expression levels in modulating COVID-19 severity, a hypothesis that fosters a rapid experimental validation on large cohorts of patients with different clinical manifestations.","Asselta, R.; Paraboschi, E.

625,Covid-19 Outbreak Progression in Italian Regions: Approaching the Peak by March 29th,"Setting: Italy and especially Lombardy is experiencing a heavy burden of Covid-19 infection. The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. Objective: We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics. Primary and Secondary Measures: In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Results. The two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected person has involved other 5 people (4.94 based on data of March 22nd) compared to a value of R0=2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4). The value of R0 is decreasing in Lombardy and Northern Regions, while it is increasing in Central and Southern Regions. Conclusion.

626,Growth rate and acceleration analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic reveals the effect of public health measures in real time,"Background: Ending the COVID-19 pandemic is arguably one of the most prominent challenges in recent human history. Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars towards achieving that goal. Objective: We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases/day) and growth acceleration (cases/day^2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Methods: The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay) and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at http://www.theguarani.com.br/covid-19 or downloaded from https://github.com/adamtaiti/SARS-CoV-2. The framework was applied to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which comprised 853,200 cases reported worldwide as of April 2nd 2020. Results: We found that the impact of public health measures on the prevalence of COVID-19 could be perceived in seemingly real-time by monitoring growth acceleration curves. Restriction to human mobility produced detectable decline in growth acceleration within few days, deceleration within ~2 weeks and near-stationary growth within ~6 weeks. Countries exhibiting different permutations of the five growth stages indicated that the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Conclusions: These results corroborate that mass social isolation is a highly effective measure against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, as previously suggested. Apart from the analysis of prevalence partitioned by country, the proposed framework is easily applicable to city, state, region and arbitrary territory data, serving as an asset to monitor the local behavior of COVID-19 cases.","Utsunomiya, Y.

Co-morbidities included cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and/or cancer other than skin, based on data from China. Overall 45.4% (95% CI 45.1-45.7) of adults reported any of the 6 comorbidities, increasing from 19.8% (19.1-20.4) for ages 18-29 years to 80.7% (79.5-81.8) for ages 80+ years. State rates ranged from 37.3% (36.2-38.5) in Utah to 58.7% (57.0-60.4) in West Virginia. Rates also varied by race/ethnicity, health insurance status, and employment. Excluded were residents of nursing homes or assisted living facilities.

We estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) by the end of April 2020. These estimates can help to strengthen the implementation of strategies to increase the health system capacity and enactment of social distancing measures all over India.","Kumar, P.; Singh, R.

630,Research on the Influence of Information Diffusion on the Transmission of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19),"With the rapid development of mobile Internet in China, the information of the epidemic is full-time and holographic, and the role of information diffusion in epidemic control is increasingly prominent. At the same time, the publicity of all kinds of big data also provides the possibility to explore the impact of media information diffusion on disease transmission. This paper explores the mechanism of the influence of information diffusion on the spread of the novel coronavirus, develops a model of the interaction between information diffusion and disease transmission based on the SIR model, and empirically tests the role and mechanism of information diffusion in the spread of COCID-19 by using econometric method. The result shows that there was a significant negative correlation between the information diffusion and the spread of the novel coronavirus; The result of robust test shows that the spread of both epidemic information and protection information hindered the further spread of the epidemic.","Shanlang, L.; Chao, M.; Ruofei, L.; Junpei, H.; Ruohan, X.; Aini, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048439v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.31.20048439v1?rss=1,2020-04-02,2020-04-02,,True

This study examines one of the most novel proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, the protein retains the ability to bind ADP-ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target.","Frick, D.; Virdi, R.

The present study was designed to investigate the changes of blood glucose levels in elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes(T2D) during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This retrospective study focused on the T2D outpatients at Fujian Provincial Hospital aged 65 years old and above who received baseline test for fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between January 1, 2019 and March 8, 2019 and were followed up on fasting plasma glucose and/or HbA1c in the same period in 2020.

634,Comparative genomics suggests limited variability and similar evolutionary patterns between major clades of SARS-Cov-2,"Phylogenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 as available from publicly available repositories suggests the presence of 3 prevalent groups of viral episomes (super-clades), which are mostly associated with outbreaks in distinct geographic locations (China, USA and Europe). While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen.","Chiara, M.; Horner, D.

635,"Flattening the curve is not enough, we need to squash it. An explainer using a simple model","Background: Around the world there are examples of both very good and effective control (e.g., South Korea, Japan) and slower, less aggressive control (e.g., Italy, Spain, United States) of COVID-19 with dramatic differences in the consequent epidemic curves. Models agree that flattening the curve without controlling the epidemic completely is insufficient and will lead to an overwhelmed health service. A recent model, calibrated for the UK and US, demonstrated this starkly. Methods: We used a simple compartmental deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission in Australia, to illustrate the dynamics resulting from shifting or flattening the curve versus completely squashing it. Results: We find that when the reproduction number is close to one, a small decrease in transmission leads to a large reduction in burden (i.e., cases, deaths and hospitalisations) but achieving this early in the epidemic through social distancing interventions also implies that the community will not reach herd immunity. Conclusions: Australia needs not just to shift and flatten the curve but to squash it by getting the reproduction number below one. This will require Australia to achieve for transmission rates at least two thirds lower than those seen in the most severely affected countries.","McBryde, E. S.; Meehan, M. T.; Trauer, J.

636,Impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric assessment in emergency and outpatient settings measured using electronic health records,"Importance: As with other traumatic events, pandemics such as coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) may precipitate or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression, while potentially interfering with health systems' capacity to treat such symptoms. Objective: To quantify the impact of increasing COVID-19 infection on extent of psychiatric assessment across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: In silico cohort using narrative clinical notes generated between 1/2/2020 and 3/25/2020 Setting: Emergency department and outpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals Participants: All individuals age 13 and older presenting to emergency department or outpatient clinics Main Outcome or Measure: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms reflecting depression, anxiety, psychosis, or suicide, and documentation of violence, was drawn from previously-validated term lists. Results: A total of 2,483,159 outpatient and 205,957 emergency department visit notes were analyzed. Instances of notes referencing depression or anxiety decreased 75-81% in outpatient settings with onset of coronavirus in March 2019, and by 44-45% in emergency departments. In adjusted logistic regression, presence of individual psychiatric symptoms in outpatient notes was associated with significant decreases in likelihood of coronavirus testing (for depression, OR=0.636, 95% CI 0.606-0.667). Conversely, presence of violence in an emergency department note was associated with greater likelihood of testing (OR=1.487, 95% CI 1.249-1.761). Conclusions and Relevance: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms in both outpatient and emergency department settings diminished sharply in the context of increasing coronavirus infection in Massachusetts, suggesting that efforts to provide additional resources to manage psychiatric symptoms will be needed.

637,A phased lift of control: a practical strategy to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 at the country level,"Most countries are affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and experience rapidly increasing numbers of cases and deaths. Many have implemented nationwide stringent control to avoid overburdening the health care system. This paralyzes economic and social activities until the availability of a vaccine, which may take years. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and Covid-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as the whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of Covid-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be significantly shortened by future developments (more IC beds, better drugs). Clearly, the strategy will have a profound impact on individuals and society, and should therefore be considered carefully by various other disciplines (e.g. health systems, ethics, economics) before actual implementation.","de Vlas, S.

638,Early surveillance and public health emergency disposal measures between novel coronavirus disease 2019 and avian influenza in China: a case-comparison study,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is spreading rapidly throughout China and the world. Hence, early surveillance and public health emergency disposal are considered crucial to curb this emerging infectious disease. However, studies that investigated the early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China are relatively few. We aimed to compare the strengths and weaknesses of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for prevention and control between COVID-19 and H7N9 avian influenza, which was commended by the international community, in China. Methods: A case-comparison study was conducted using a set of six key time nodes to form a reference framework for evaluating early surveillance and public health emergency disposal between H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai, China and COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Findings: A report to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China, for the first hospitalized patient was sent after 6 and 20 days for H7N9 avian influenza and COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the pathogen was identified faster in the case of COVID-19 than in the case of H7N9 avian influenza (12 days vs. 31 days). The government response regarding COVID-19 was 10 days later than that regarding avian influenza. The entire process of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal lasted 5 days longer in COVID-19 than in H7N9 avian influenza (46 days vs. 41 days). Conclusions: The identification of the unknown pathogen improved in China between the outbreaks of avian influenza and COVID-19. The longer emergency disposal period in the case of COVID-19 could be attributed to the government's slower response to the epidemic. Improving public health emergency management could lessen the adverse social effects of emerging infectious diseases and public health crisis in the future.","Zhang, T.; Shi, W.; Wang, Y.; Bai, G.; Dai, R.; Wang, Q.; Luo, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046490v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046490v1?rss=1,2020-04-01,2020-04-01,,True

640,Assessing the interactions between COVID-19 and influenza in the United States,"The 2019-2020 influenza sentinel surveillance data exhibits unexpected trends. Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019-2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is sufficient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season. We suggest that when surveillance for a novel pathogen is limited, surveillance streams of co-circulating infections may provide a signal.","Zipfel, C.

641,How will this continue? Modelling interactions between the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses,"Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show that the inherent randomness of societal processes can lead to a wide range of possible outcomes, both in terms of disease dynamics and mortality, even when the principles according to which policy and population operate are identical.. Our model is easily modified to take other aspects of the socio-pandemic interaction into account.","Rossberg, A. G.; Knell, R.

At the ecological level, regression coefficients are examined to figure out contextual variables influencing the pandemic's exponential growth rate across 96 countries. Results. While a strong institutional context is negatively associated with the outbreak (B = -0.55 ... -0.64, p < 0.001), the pandemic's growth rate is steeper in countries with a quality education system (B = 0.33, p < 0.001). Countries with an older population are more affected (B = 0.46, p < 0.001). Societies with individualistic (rather than collectivistic) values experience a flatter rate of pathogen proliferation (B = -0.31, p < 0.001), similarly for higher levels of power distance (B = -0.32, p < 0.001). Hedonistic values, that is seeking indulgence and not enduring restraints, are positively related to the outbreak (B = 0.23, p = 0.001). Conclusions.

Effective therapeutic drugs are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis of patients, but currently no such drugs are available. Methods Patients in the study were divided into a heparin and a control group based on whether low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was used. D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage, interleukin-6, and other indices in 42 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed to compare and evaluate the progress of patients before and after LMWH treatment. Results Compared to the control group, D-dimer levels in the heparin group significantly increased before treatment, and there was no significant difference after treatment. There was no significant difference in the change of CRP levels between the two groups of patients before and after LMWH treatment, and levels for both groups were significantly lower after, compared to before, treatment. Compared to the control group, patients in the heparin group had a higher percentage of lymphocytes after treatment and lower levels of interleukin-6; these differences were statistically significant. Conclusions Under conventional antiviral treatment regimens, LMWH can improve hypercoagulability, inhibit IL-6 release, and counteract IL-6 biological activity in patients. LMWH has potential antiviral effects and can help delay or block inflammatory cytokine storms. It can also increase the lymphocytes (LYM%)of patients and has the potential for treatment of COVID-19.","SHI, C.; WANG, C.; WANG, H.; YANG, C.; CAI, F.; ZENG, F.; CHENG, F.; LIU, Y.; ZHOU, T.; DENG, B.; LI, J.; ZHANG, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046144v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046144v1?rss=1,2020-04-01,2020-04-01,,True

647,Detection of Air and Surface Contamination by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Hospital Rooms of Infected Patients,"Understanding the particle size distribution in the air and patterns of environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for infection prevention policies. We aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 surface and air contamination and study associated patient-level factors. 245 surface samples were collected from 30 airborne infection isolation rooms of COVID-19 patients, and air sampling was conducted in 3 rooms. Air sampling detected SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive particles of sizes >4 m and 1-4 m in two rooms, which warrants further study of the airborne transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. 56.7% of rooms had at least one environmental surface contaminated. High touch surface contamination was shown in ten (66.7%) out of 15 patients in the first week of illness, and three (20%) beyond the first week of illness (p = 0.01).","Chia, P. Y.; Coleman, K.

648,Guideline-based Chinese herbal medicine treatment plus standard care for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (G-CHAMPS): evidence from China,"Abstract Objectives: To assess outcomes in patients who have severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and were treated with either China guideline based Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) plus standard care or standard care alone. Design: A pilot randomized controlled trial. Setting Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China Patients: A total of 42 adults with severe COVID-19. Interventions: Participants in the CHM plus standard care group received CHM and standard care, and the control group received standard care alone. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment at 7 days. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]; 21 [50%] were aged [&ge;] 65 years; and 35 [83%] women, 42 (100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift towards death was lower in the CHM plus group than the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148 to 2.352 P=.454). Three (2 from the CHM plus group and 1 from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 18% (5) vs 14% (2), 71% (20) vs 64% (9), and 0% (0) vs 7% (1) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone. Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

649,Understanding COVID-19 spreading through simulation modeling and scenarios comparison: preliminary results.,"Since late 2019 the world is facing the rapid spreading of a novel viral disease (SARS-CoV-2) provoked by the coronavirus 2 infection (COVID-19), declared pandemic last 12 March 2020. As of 27 March 2020, there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths worldwide. In those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has over-saturate the medical facilities and, in turn, rise the mortality rate. In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing, quarantine and physical distancing are ways to reduce the growing speed of new infections. Thus, these measures should be a priority for all governments in order to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated to this disease. System dynamics is widely used in many fields of the biological sciences to study and explain changing systems. The system dynamics approach can help us understand the rapid spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 and also generate scenarios to test the effect of different control measures. The aim of this study is to provide an open model (using STELLA(R) from Iseesystems) that can be customized to any area/region and by any user, allowing them to evaluate the different behavior of the COVID-19 dynamics under different scenarios. Thus, our intention is not to generate a model to accurately predict the evolution of the disease nor to supplant others more robust -official and non-official- from governments and renowned institutions. We believe that scenarios comparison can be an effective tool to convince the society of the need of a colossal and unprecedented effort to reduce new infections and ultimately, fatalities.","BORDEHORE, C.; Navarro, M.; Herrador, Z.; Fonfria, E.

650,Risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients : a systematic review and meta analysis,"Importance: With the increasing number of infections for COVID-19, the global health resources are deficient. At present, we don't have specific medicines or vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and our assessment of risk factors for patients with severe pneumonia was limited. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible. Objective: To systematically review the evidence of risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic data bases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Weipu, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM-SinoMed), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register, and Web of science. The American agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Mata-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0. Results: 20 articles (N=4062 participants) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, the laboratory test results of severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients, such as the elevated levels of white-cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein and procalcitonin, etc, while the decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin, etc. Interpretation: This is the first systematic review investigating the risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

651,SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers: a retrospective analysis and a model study,"Background There had been a preliminary occurrence of human-to-human transmissions between healthcare workers (HCWs), but risk factors in the susceptibility for COVID-19, and infection patterns among HCWs have largely remained unknown. Methods Retrospective data collection on demographics, lifestyles, contact status with infected subjects for 118 HCWs (include 12 COVID-19 HCWs) from a single-center. Sleep quality and working pressure were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and The Nurse Stress Index (NSI), respectively. Follow-up duration was from Dec 25, 2019, to Feb 15, 2020. Risk factors and transmission models of COVID-19 among HCWs were analyzed and constructed. Findings A high proportion of COVID-19 HCWs had engaged in night shift-work (75.0% vs. 40.6%) and felt they were working under pressure (66.7% vs. 32.1%) than uninfected HCWs. COVID-19 HCWs had higher total scores of PSQI and NSI than uninfected HCWs. Furthermore, these scores were both positively associated with COVID-19 risk. An individual-based model (IBM) estimated the outbreak duration among HCWs in a non-typical COVID-19 ward at 62-80 days and the basic reproduction number =1.27 [1.06, 1.61]. By reducing the average contact rate per HCW by a 1.35 factor and susceptibility by a 1.40 factor, we can avoid an outbreak of the basic case among HCWs. Interpretation Poor sleep quality and high working pressure were positively associated with high risks of COVID-19. A novel IBM of COVID-19 transmission is suitable for simulating different outbreak patterns in a hospital setting.","Bai, Y.; Wang, X.; Huang, Q.; Wang, H.; Gurarie, D.; Ndeffo-Mbah, M.; Fan, F.; Fu, P.; Horn, M.

To prevent the escalation of its transmission, China locked down one-third of its cities and strictly restricted human mobility and economic activities. Using timely and comprehensive air quality data in China, we show that these counter-COVID-19 measures led to remarkable improvement in air quality. Within weeks, the Air Quality Index and PM2.5 concentrations were brought down by 25%. The effects are larger in colder, richer, and more industrialized cities.

653,"How lethal is the novel coronavirus, and how many undetected cases there are? The importance of being tested.","There is big concern for estimating the lethality and the extent of undetected infections associated with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 outbreak. While detailed epidemiological models are certainly needed, I suggest here an orthogonal approach based on a minimum number of parameters robustly fitted from the cumulative data easily accessible for all countries at the John Hopkins University database that became the worldwide reference for the pandemics. I show that, after few days from the beginning of the outbreak, the apparent death rate can be extrapolated to infinite time through regularized regression such as rescaled ridge regression. The variation from country to country of these extrapolated death rates appears to depend almost only (r^2=0.91) on the ratio between performed tests and detected cases even when the instantaneous apparent lethality rates are as different as 9% in Italy and 0.4% in Germany. Extrapolating to the limit of infinite number of tests, I obtain a death rate of 0.012+/- 0.012, in agreement with other estimates. The inverse relationship between the extrapolated death rate and the intensity tests allows estimating that more than 50% of cases were undetected in most countries, with more than 90% undetected cases in countries severely hit by the epidemics such as Italy. Finally, I propose to adopt the ratio between the cumulative number of recovered and deceased persons as an indicator that can anticipate the halting of the epidemics.","Bastolla, U.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045062v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045062v1?rss=1,2020-04-01,2020-04-01,,True
654,Patterns of the COVID19 epidemic spread around the world: exponential vs power laws,"We have analyzed the COVID19 epidemic data of more than 174 countries (excluding China) in the period between January 22 and March 28, 2020. We found that some countries (such as the US, the UK, and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. At the same time, regardless of the best fitting law, most countries can be shown to follow a trajectory similar to that of Italy, but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with ``younger"" epidemics tend to exhibit more exponential like behavior, while countries that are closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power-law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may not be a consequence of working non-pharmaceutical interventions (except for, perhaps, restricting the air travel). Instead, this is a normal course of raging infection spread. On the practical side, this cautions us against overly optimistic interpretations of the countries epidemic development and emphasizes the need to continue improving the compliance with social distancing behavior recommendations.","Wodarz, D.; Komarova, N.

656,Perception of emergent epidemic of COVID-2019 / SARS CoV-2 on the Polish Internet,"Problem: Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus infection and COVID-2019 disease, there is an urgent need to analyze COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. Methods: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. Results: We identified three major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease with a massive mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. Twitter reflected the clear, structural division of the Polish political sphere. We were able to identify potential sources of misinformation as well as key actors (especially early adopters) and influencers. Conclusions: Traditional and social media not only reflect reality, but also create it. Polish authorities, having a reliable analysis of the perception of the problem, could optimally prepare and manage the social dimension of the current epidemic and future ones. Due to filter bubbles observed on Twitter, public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected. For greater penetration, it might be necessary to diversify information channels to reach as many people as possible which might already be happening. Moreover, it might be necessary to prevent the spread of disinformation, which is now possible due to the special law on combating COVID-2019.","Jarynowski, A.; Wojta-Kempa, M.; Belik, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046789v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046789v1?rss=1,2020-04-01,2020-04-01,,True

The time-delay adjusted case fatality risk of COVID-19 in Korea is yet to be estimated. Methods: We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea reported prior to March 21,2020. Using statistical methods, we estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in the city of Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, other regions in Korea, as well as for the entire country. Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do, partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of the risk for death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6-3.4%), 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0-1.6%) in Daegu and 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.3-1.4%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate of the risk for death was estimated at 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2-1.7%) in Korea. Conclusions: The relatively low CFRs are associated with the early implementation of public health interventions including widespread testing, social distancing, and delayed school openings in Korea.

These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people. Time horizon: 200 days. Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2. Results of Base-Case analysis: The number of expected deaths is 389 in strategy 1 versus 432 in strategy 2. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in case of adhering to global isolation will be $ 102,383,282 to prevent one case of death. Results of sensitivity analysis: The ICER value is between $ 22.5 million to over $280 million per one avoided death. Conclusions: According to our model, global isolation will save ~43 more lives compared to a strategy of focused isolation and extensive screening. This benefit is implicated in tremendous costs that might result in overwhelming economic effects. Limitations: Compartment models do not necessarily fit to countries with heterogeneous populations. In addition, we rely on current published parameters that might not reliably reflect infection dynamics.","Shlomai, A.; Leshno, A.; Sklan, E.

The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID-19.","Jain, N.; Shankar, U.; Majee, P.; Kumar, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.009209v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.009209v1?rss=1,2020-04-01,2020-04-01,,False
661,Prediction of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes across 9360 HLA class I alleles,"Elucidating antiviral CD8 T lymphocyte responses to SARS-CoV-2 may shed light on the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes and inform vaccine or therapeutic approaches. To facilitate the evaluation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, we generated a publicly accessible database of epitopes predicted to bind any class I HLA protein across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. While a subset of epitopes from earlier betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV (SARS), have been validated experimentally, validation systems are often biased toward specific HLA haplotypes (notably HLA-A*02:01) that only account for a fraction of the haplotypes of individuals affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To enable evaluation of epitopes across individuals with a variety of HLA haplotypes, we computed the predicted binding affinities between 9-mer peptides derived from the annotated SARS-CoV-2 peptidome across 9,360 MHC class I HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles. There were 6,748 unique combinations of peptides and HLA alleles (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity of less than 500nM, including 1,103 unique peptides and 1,022 HLA alleles, spanning 11 annotated superfamilies.

Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-time lockdown is one where the midpoint of the lockdown period coincides with the actual peak of the spread of the disease in the absence of the lockdown. We further show that the true effectivity of imposing a lockdown may be misrepresented and grossly underestimated by the reported case trajectories in the days following the action.","Shayak, B.; Sharma, M.

663,Molecular Docking Analysis Of Some Phytochemicals On Two SARS-CoV-2 Targets,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (previously called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease recently declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization. At the moment there is no available drug(s) and vaccine(s) for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 spike envelope glycoprotein (S) and main protease (Mpro) are crucial determinants in the virus infectious process and have been recognized as key targets for therapeutics designs. In the present in silico study, a library of 22 phytochemicals with antiviral activity obtained from PubChem Database was screened for activity against 6lu7 and 6vsb with the PyRX software. Six lead compounds with binding energies within the range of -9 to -9.6 Kcal/mol were selected for molecular docking analyses against 6lu7. SwissADMET and Molinspiration Cheminformatics for CLogP (mean range of 0.77-8.72) of the lead compounds showed no correlation observed between lipophilicity and interaction with receptors and all the compounds except for baicalin exhibited drug-like properties based on Lipinski and Veber filter. The ADMET profile showed that lead compounds lack hepatotoxicity and mutagenicity effects while they show variable immunotoxicity, carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity. The compounds Scopodulic acid and Dammarenolic acid showed the best-fit value of activity against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein 6vsb and main protease Mpro 6lu7 targets, respectively. Our data suggest silibinin a repurposing candidate drug may have multitarget activity against SARS-CoV-2. So further in vitro and in vivo evaluations are recommended.","Ubani, A.; Agwom, F.; Shehu, N. Y.; Luka, P.; Umera, E. A.; Umar, U.; Omale, S.; Nnadi, E.; Aguiyi, J.

664,The COVID-19 infection in Italy: a statistical study of an abnormally severe disease,"We statistically investigate the Coronavirus Disease 19 (hereinafter Covid-19) epidemics, which is particularly invasive in Italy. We show that the high apparent mortality (or Case Fatality Ratio, CFR) observed in Italy, as compared with other countries, is likely biased by a strong underestimation of infected cases. To give a more realistic estimate of the mortality of Covid-19, we use the most recent estimates of the IFR (Infection Fatality Ratio) of epidemic, based on the minimum observed CFR, and furthermore analyse data obtained from the ship Diamond Princess, a good representation of a laboratory case-study from an isolated system in which all the people have been tested. From such analyses we derive more realistic estimates of the real extension of the infection, as well as more accurate indicators of how fast the infection propagates. We then point out from the various explanations proposed, the dominant factors causing such an abnormal seriousness of the disease in Italy. Finally, we use the deceased data, the only ones estimated to be reliable enough, to predict the total number of infected people and the interval of time when the infection in Italy could stop.","De Natale, G.; Ricciardi, V.; De Luca, G.; De Natale, D.; Di Meglio, G.; Ferragamo, A.; Marchitelli, V.; Piccolo, A.; Scala, A.; Somma, R.; Spina, E.; Troise, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243v1?rss=1,2020-04-01,2020-04-01,,True
665,Why is chest CT important for early diagnosis of COVID-19? Prevalence matters,"SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is a global pandemic disease (COVID-19). Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69 - 84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID-19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.","Esposito, A.; Palmisano, A.; Scotti, G.

666,COVID-19 Epidemic in Switzerland: Growth Prediction and Containment Strategy Using Artificial Intelligence and Big Data,"Using a previously developed agent-based artificial intelligence simulation platform (EnerPol) coupled with Big Data, the evolution and containment of COVID-19 in Switzerland is examined. The EnerPol platform has been used in a broad range of case studies in different sectors in all of Europe, USA, Japan, South Korea and sub Saharan Africa over the last 10 years. In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83300 COVID-19 cases, and 73300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives. It is argued that future scenarios regarding relaxation of the lockdown should be carefully simulated, as by 19 April 2020, there will still remain a substantial number of infected individuals, who could retrigger a second spread of COVID-19. Through the use of a digital tool, such as Enerpol, to evaluate in a data-driven manner the impacts of various policy scenarios, the most effective measures to mitigate a spread of COVID-19 can be devised while we await the deployment of large-scale vaccination for the population globally. By tailoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spread to match the capacity of local healthcare facilities, appropriate logistic needs can be determined, in order not to overwhelm the health care services across the country.","Abhari, R.

667,Demand for hospitalization services for COVID-19 patients in Brazil,"COVID-19 is now a pandemic and many of the affected countries face severe shortages of hospital resources. In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experience shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in early April, the most critical situation observed for ICU beds. Increasing the allocation of beds for COVID-19 (in lieu of other conditions) or temporarily placing all resources under the administration of the state delays the anticipated start of shortages by a week. This suggests that solutions adopted by the Brazilian government must aim at expanding the available capacity (e.g., makeshift hospitals), and not simply prioritizing the allocation of available resources to COVID-19.","Castro, M.

669,Optimal timing for social distancing during an epidemic,"Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when facing a novel pathogen and no pharmacological interventions are available. In such cases, conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak to more effectively mitigate the spread of the disease. Using a simple epidemiological model we show that, however, there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire further investigations within the context of more complex and data-driven epidemiological models, and can ultimately help decision makers to improve temporal social distancing policies to mitigate the spread of epidemics.","Patterson-Lomba, O.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048132v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048132v1?rss=1,2020-04-01,2020-04-01,,True
670,Analytical sensitivity and efficiency comparisons of SARS-COV-2 qRT-PCR assays,"The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt clinical and public health interventions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to be used as assay standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used these (1) RNA transcript standards, (2) full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and (3) pre-COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs, and (4) clinical samples from COVID-19 patients to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of the qRT-PCR primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, but there are clear differences in the ability to differentiate between true negatives and positives with low amounts of virus. We found that several primer-probe sets cross-react with SARS-CoV-2-negative nasopharyngeal swabs. However, background cross-reactivity by the 2019-nCoV_N2 set issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not interfere with outcomes of the combined 'N1' and 'N2' assay when testing COVID-19 clinical samples. Our findings characterize the limitations of currently used primer-probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Vogels, C. B.

671,Early behavior of Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak: A mathematical model,"Introduction: Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak started on 28 February 2020 and since then it became the main Covid-19 disease cluster in Spain. On 26 March 2020, a total of 17166 cases were already reported, with 2090 deaths. Globally a R0 index of 2-3 has been reported. We aimed to build an experimental mathematical model that help to analyze the early characteristics of Madrid Covid-19 disese outbreak and to explore the actual R0 index on Madrid Covid-19 outbreak. Material and Methods: A simulated mathematical model was built, based on a SIR epidemiological model and the reported characteristics of Wuhan Covid-19 disease outbreak. Monte Carlo simulations were further done to estimate the R0 value over time in the Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak. Results: Mean estimated R0 value along the early period is of 2.22 (+/- 1.21 SD). A significant increase of 0.093 (+/- 0.037, p=0.025) in R0 value each day of outbreak is found. Conclussions: Our proposed Mathematical Simulation model may be useful to evaluate early characteristics of this outbreak. The present work is the first reported estimation of R0 value in the Spanish Madrid Covid-19 outbreak, with similar results to the previous reported in the Wuhan outbreak, although it may suggest a slightly increase on R0 along time.","Garcia-Iglesias, D.; de Cos Juez, F.

672,Global trends in air travel: implications for connectivity and resilience to infectious disease threats,"Background: Increased connectivity via air travel can facilitate the geographic spread of infectious diseases. The number of travelers alone does not explain risk; passenger origin and destination will also influence risk of disease introduction and spread. We described trends in international air passenger numbers and connectivity between countries with different capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. Methods: We used the Fragile States Index (FSI) as an annual measure of country-level resilience and capacity to respond to infectious disease events. Countries are categorized as: Sustainable, Stable, Warning, or Alert, in order of increasing fragility. We included data for 177 sovereign states for the years 2007 to 2016. Annual inbound and outbound international air passengers for each country were obtained for the same time period. We examined trends in FSI score, trends in worldwide air travel, and the association between a state's FSI score and air travel. Results: Among countries included in the FSI rankings, the total number of passengers increased from 0.791 billion to 1.28 billion between 2007 and 2016. Increasing fragility was associated with a decrease in travel volumes, with a 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3-3.5%) reduction in passengers per 1-unit increase in FSI score. Overall, travel between countries of different FSI categories either increased or remained stable. The greatest increase was observed for travel to Warning countries from Warning countries, with an annual increase of 8,967,623 passengers (95%CI: 6,546,494 to 11,388,753) over the study period. Conclusions: The world's connectivity via air travel has increased dramatically over the past decade. There has been notable growth in travel from Warning and Stable countries, which comprise more than three-quarters of international air travel passengers. These countries may have suboptimal capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease threats that emerge within their borders.","Tuite, A. R.; Bhatia, D.; Moineddin, R.; Bogoch, I.; Watts, A.

675,The first three months of the COVID-19 epidemic: Epidemiological evidence for two separate strains of SARS-CoV-2 viruses spreading and implications for prevention strategies,"About one month after the COVID-19 epidemic peaked in Mainland China and SARS-CoV-2 migrated from China westward to Europe and then the U.S., the epidemiological data begin to provide important insights into the risks associated with the disease and the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Like other respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, the virus remains only about two months in any given population, yet the peak incidence and the lethality can vary. The data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, and Italy were hit by the more dangerous ""SKII"" variant. While the epidemic in China is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the course of the epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing and the peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the US first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. While containment merely prolongs the time the disease circulates until the proportion of immune people is high enough for ""herd immunity"", reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease.","Wittkowski, K.

We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitigation policies. Given the early stage at which the epidemic is at the date of writing in Mexico, we hope these ideas can be helpful for the understanding of the importance of isolation, social distancing and screening of the general population.","Acuna-Zegarra, M.

678,Evaluation of the awareness level of Healthcare workers toward NCOVID-2019 in Pakistan,"Background Novel Coronavirus infection disease 2019 (NCOVID-19), caused by the corona virus, was first spotted in Wuhan, city of China, December 2019. The NCOVID-19 virus is spread among individuals through close communication in the form of droplets, not via airborne. Those individuals are at risk of infection who are in close contact with a NCOVID-19 patient or who take care of NCOVID-19 patients. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of any infection in healthcare facilities. Therefore, healthcare workers should be aware of basic knowledge and all procedures concerning prevention and protection from NCOVID-19. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the awareness level of healthcare workers toward NCOVID-2019 in Pakistan. Material and Methods A questionnaire was generated according to WHO information that was circulated among the healthcare workers of different hospitals and medical institutes of Pakistan. Calculated sample size was 650. Conclusion Healthcare workers have insufficient knowledge of preventive measures and infection control.

679,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies.

Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19. Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images of the chest X- rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for the health professionals.

681,Determination of daily reproduction numbers of SARS-CoV2 based on death cases suggests more rapid initial spread in Italy and the United States,"Population density, behaviour and cultural habits strongly influence the spread of pathogens. Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations. As the number of deaths rapidly increases worldwide, we encourage more sophisticated modelling of the epidemic based on the dynamics of death cases by experts in the field.","Ensser, A.; Ueberla, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046094v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046094v1?rss=1,2020-03-31,2020-03-31,,True
682,The Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) Directly Decimates Human Spleens and Lymph Nodes,"While lymphocytopenia is a common characteristic of patients infected by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the mechanisms responsible for this depletion are unclear. Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses on tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) can be found in ACE2+ cells, CD169+ macrophages, but not in CD3+ T cells or B220+ B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions. Moreover, in situ TUNEL staining illustrated that viral infection leads to severe lymphocyte apoptosis, which might be mediated by viral antigens inducing Fas upregulation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 also triggers macrophages to produce IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine that directly promotes lymphocyte necrosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 directly neutralizes human spleens and LNs through infecting tissue- resident CD169+ macrophages.","chen, y.; Feng, Z.; Diao, B.; Wang, R.; Wang, G.; Wang, C.; Tan, Y.; Liu, L.; Wang, C.; Liu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Yuan, Z.; Ren, L.; Wu, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045427v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045427v1?rss=1,2020-03-31,2020-03-31,,True
683,"A Territory-wide study of COVID-19 cases and clusters with unknown source in Hong Kong community: A clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic investigation","Background: Initial cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported in Hong Kong were mostly imported cases from Mainland China. However, most cases reported in February 2020 were local infections with unknown source, indicating local community transmissions. This study aimed to report the clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic characteristics of the local cases of COVID-19 in our community. Methods: We extracted the demographic, clinical and epidemiological data from 50 COVID-19 patients, who accounted for 53.8% of the cases in Hong Kong by the end of February 2020. We used both Nanopore and Illumina platforms to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from these patients. Phylogenetic relatedness among these local cases and their placement in the global phylogeny were examined. The evolutionary rate and divergence time of transmission were also determined. Findings: Of these 50 patients, only three (6.0%) had visited Wuhan while 43 (86.0%) did not have recent travel records. The average interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.5 days. The most common signs and symptoms on admission were cough (74.0%) and fever (58.0%). Radiographic abnormality was found in 46 (92.0%) patients. Three (6.0%) patients required ICU admission. Phylogenetic analysis concurred with epidemiological investigation that 42 (84.0%) cases could be grouped into six transmission clusters. Forty-four (88.0%) cases harboured a common mutation Orf3a G251V. Global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that most (88.0%) cases in Hong Kong were clustered in two subclades with the strains from other countries. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of COVID-2019 outbreak in Hong Kong was December 24, 2019 with an evolutionary rate of 3.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year. The reproduction number value was 1.84 as of February 28, 2020 in Hong Kong. Interpretation: We provided a territory-wide overview of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, which has borders connecting to Mainland China. Transmission in closed settings especially during family and religious gatherings is a hallmark of the recently reported cases. The reproduction number value indicated an ongoing outbreak in the community.

685,"Inferring Timing of Infection Using Within-host SARS-CoV-2 Infection Dynamics Model: Are ""Imported Cases"" Truly Imported?","Importance: Although the COVID-19 epidemic in some countries such as China are in the last phase by large effort for containment of the disease, another outbreaks can occur because huge susceptible population remains. Further, there remain countries in the early phase of outbreak with zero or limited number of cases in southern hemisphere countries. In those countries at risk of future outbreak, ascertaining whether cases are imported or the result of local secondary transmission is important for government to shape appropriate public health strategies. Objective: To develop a method to estimate timing of infection establishment, which helps differentiate imported and autochthonous cases. Design, Setting and Participants: Of the first 18 cases reported in Singapore, 12 were used in our study (1 case with insufficient data and 5 on anti-viral treatment were excluded from the analysis). The viral load data from these initial cases considered imported due to their travel history to Wuhan were analyzed. Another viral load data from 3 cases reported from Zhuhai, China, for whom exposed day were known, were also analyzed to determine the viral load threshold for infection establishment. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test. Main Outcomes and Measures: The timing of infection establishment of each case was assessed by analysing viral load data after symptom onset using a within-host viral dynamics model for SARS-CoV-2. Estimated timing of infection will indicate whether cases are imported or autochthonous transmission within Singapore. Results: Six among the 12 cases were clearly imported cases, whereas we could not rule out the possibility of secondary transmission for the rest of 6 cases, which collectively evidenced ongoing transmission in Singapore. For the 6 cases who could be the results of secondary transmission, further investigation to identify the source of infection within Singapore should be warranted (i.e., contact tracing). Conclusions and Relevance: In an early phase of outbreak due to entrance or re-entrance of the virus to countries/communities, collecting viral load data over time from cases from symptom onset is highly recommended, because viral load data are valuable to infer the timing of infection and distinguish between imported cases and ongoing local transmission.","Ejima, K.; Kim, K.

686,"Eco-epidemiological assessment of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, January-February 2020","Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 in China in early 2020 provides a rich data source for exploring the ecological determinants of this new infection, which may be of relevance elsewhere. Objectives: Assessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25{degrees} latitude/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios. Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0 to 30.1 {degrees}C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4 to 23.0 {degrees}C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm-2 and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence. Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China.

As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus. | Methods: We adopted the Huike database to extract news articles about coronavirus from major press media, between January 1st, 2020, to February 20th, 2020. The data were sorted and analyzed by Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number using the coherence number. We operated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling with the suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into two-dimensional plane via multidimensional scaling. | Findings: After removing duplicates, 7791 relevant news reports were identified. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as our number of topics and obtained their names and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, global/local social/economic influences, accounting for 32.6%, 16.6%, 11.8% of the collected reports respectively. | Interpretation: The Chinese mass media news reports lag behind the COVID-19 outbreak development. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a global issue, and society has also become concerned about donation and support as well as mental health.

We have developed a mathematical model to predict the impact of such measures in the number of infected cases and peak of infection. We estimate the peak to be around 2 million infected cases by the beginning of May if no additional measures are taken. The model indicates that current measures effectively isolated 25-30% of the population, contributing for some reduction on the infection peak. Importantly, our simulations show that the infection burden can be further reduced with higher isolation degree, providing information for a second intervention.","Pais, R.

691,Estimating the size of COVID-19 epidemic outbreak,"In this work, we analyze the epidemic data of cumulative infected cases collected from many countries as reported by WHO starting from January 21st,2020 and up till March 21st,2020. Our inspection is motivated by the renormalization group (RG) framework. Here we propose the RG-inspired logistic function of the form E(t) = a(1 + ec(t-t0))-n as an epidemic strength function with n being asymmetry in the modified logistic function. We perform the non-linear least-squares analysis with data from various countries. The uncertainty for model parameters is computed using the squared root of the corresponding diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We carefully divide countries under consideration into 2 categories based on the estimation of the inflection point: the maturing phase and the growth-dominated phase. We observe that long-term estimations of cumulative infected cases of countries in the maturing phase for both n=1 and n= 1 are close to each other. We find from the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) that the RG-inspired logistic model with n= 1 is slightly preferable in this category. We also argue that n determines the characteristic of the epidemic at an early stage. However, in the second category, the estimated asymptotic number of cumulative infected cases contain rather large uncertainty. Therefore, in the growth-dominated phase, we focus on using n= 1 for countries in this phase. Some of them are in an early stage of an epidemic with an insufficient amount of data leading to a large uncertainty on parameter fits. In terms of the accuracy of the size estimation, the results do strongly depend on limitations on data collection and the epidemic phase for each country.","Pongkitivanichkul, C.; Samart, D.; Tangphati, T.; Koomhin, P.; Pimton, P.; Dam-O, P.; Payaka, A.; Channuie, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20044339v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20044339v1?rss=1,2020-03-31,2020-03-31,,True

Molecular dynamic simulations revealed long-range covariant movements of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer in pre-fusion conformation with furin cleavage, and residue T333, under purifying selection, hinge of such movement. Evolutionary analysis revealed that the current human lineage likely emerged after a recombination event between ancestors in bat and pangolin. Recombination impacted residues located in the binding receptor region of S glycoprotein, identical to pangolin ancestor. Interestingly, several recombination hotspots were detected throughout the genome, with the exception of the S glycoprotein, which exhibits a coldspot in the N terminal region, possibly the result of negative selection against changes that may reduce its optimal fitness.","Tagliamonte, M.

693,Atlas of ACE2 gene expression in mammals reveals novel insights in transmission of SARS-Cov-2,"BackgroundCOVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic. It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsWe analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels.

ResultsWe first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined. Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans.

ConclusionsThrough building the first atlas of ACE2 expression in pets and livestock, we identified species and tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding novel insights into the viral transmission.","Sun, K.; Gu, L.; Ma, L.; Duan, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015644v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015644v1?rss=1,2020-03-31,2020-03-31,,False

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a receptor of 2019-nCoV spike 1 protein (S1) and mediates viral entry into host cells. Despite the abundance of ACE2 in small intestine, few digestive symptoms are observed in patients infected by 2019-nCoV. Herein, we investigated the interactions between ACE2 and human defensins (HDs) specifically secreted by intestinal Paneth cells. The lectin-like HD5, rather than HD6, bound ACE2 with a high affinity of 39.3 nM and weakened the subsequent recruitment of 2019-nCoV S1. The cloak of HD5 on the ligand-binding domain of ACE2 was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation. A remarkable dose-dependent preventive effect of HD5 on 2019-nCoV S1 binding to intestinal epithelial cells was further evidenced by in vitro experiments. Our findings unmasked the innate defense function of lectin-like intestinal defensin against 2019-nCoV, which may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.","Wang, C.; Wang, S.; Li, D.; Zhao, X.; Han, S.; Wang, T.; Zhao, G.; Chen, Y.; Chen, F.; Zhao, J.; Wang, L.; Sun, W.; Huang, Y.; Su, Y.; Wei, D.; Zhao, J.; Wang, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.013490v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.013490v1?rss=1,2020-03-31,2020-03-31,,False

Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that these sequences were in different clades, indicating that no major strain has been circulating in Taiwan.

697,"A one-enzyme RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2, and procedures for reagent production","Given the scale of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the need for reliable, scalable testing, and the likelihood of reagent shortages, especially in resource-poor settings, we have developed a RT-qPCR assay that relies on an alternative to conventional viral reverse transcriptases, a thermostable reverse transcriptase / DNA polymerase (RTX)1. Here we show that RTX performs comparably to the other assays sanctioned by the CDC and validated in kit format. We demonstrate two modes of RTX use - (i) dye-based RT-qPCR assays that require only RTX polymerase, and (ii) TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that use a combination of RTX and Taq DNA polymerases (as the RTX exonuclease does not degrade a TaqMan probe). We also provide straightforward recipes for the purification of this alternative reagent. We anticipate that in low resource or point-of-need settings researchers could obtain the available constructs from Addgene or our lab and begin to develop their own assays, within whatever regulatory framework exists for them.

We lay out protocols for dye-based and TaqMan probe-based assays, in order to best compare with  gold standard reagents. These protocols should form the basis of further modifications that can simplify the assay to the use of overexpressing cells themselves as reagents.

698,Evolutionary origins of the SARS-CoV-2 sarbecovirus lineage responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic,"There are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 in Hubei province that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the relationship of the new virus to the SARS-related coronaviruses, (2) the role of bats as a reservoir species, (3) the potential role of other mammals in the emergence event, and (4) the role of recombination in viral emergence. Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses - the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 - exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again.

In BriefThe Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent recombination in its evolutionary history. We characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects of recombination. Using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus evolutionary rates, we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of SARS-CoV-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982.

Key PointsO_LIRaTG13 is the closest available bat virus to SARS-CoV-2; a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to infect humans. Two sister lineages of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage infect Malayan pangolins.
C_LIO_LIThe sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events, indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity; the sarbecoviruses are efficient  explorers of phenotype space.
C_LIO_LIThe SARS-CoV-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant, at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date.
C_LIO_LINon-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified, allowing for phylogenetic inference and dating to be performed. We constructed three such regions using different methods.
C_LIO_LIWe estimate that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago. There is a diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats.
C_LIO_LIWhile an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out, the relevant evolution for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats.

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats; however, the intermediate animal sources of the virus are completely unknown. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but efficiently in ferrets and cats. We found that the virus transmits in cats via respiratory droplets.

We describe here the development of a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting naive CDRs into framework regions of an identified human germline IGHV allele. This enabled the isolation of high-affinity single-domain antibodies of fully human origin. The panning using SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 as antigens resulted in the identification of antibodies targeting five types of neutralizing or non-neutralizing epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These fully human single-domain antibodies bound specifically to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of them were found to potently neutralize pseudotyped and live virus, and therefore may represent promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-19.

702,Biophysical characterization of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein binding with the ACE2 receptor explains increased COVID-19 pathogenesis,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel highly virulent pathogen which gains entry to human cells by binding with the cell surface receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). We contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) from (i) SARS-CoV-2, (ii) the related but less virulent OC43 (Singapore COVID-19 strain), and (iii) the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1. We find that the RBDs of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are highly optimized to achieve the strongest possible binding interaction with ACE2 which is consistent with its enhanced pathogenicity. SARS-CoV-2 RBDs form the most stable complex with ACE2 (64.91%, and 28.07% higher binding scores than SARS-CoV-1 and OC43, respectively) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. In fact, the spike protein RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 out-compete the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 64% in terms of binding affinity (quantified using the Rosetta scoring function). They accomplish this through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. We further discern biophysical insights that explain higher susceptibility by cats, while dogs show lower and chicken no susceptibility to the virus. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.","Chowdhury, R.; Maranas, C.

707,Computational Prediction of the Comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. Human Interactome to Guide the Design of Therapeutics,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWUnderstanding the disease pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, denoted SARS-CoV-2, is critical to the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. The global propagation of the viral disease, denoted COVID-19 (""coronavirus disease 2019""), has unified the scientific community in searching for possible inhibitory small molecules or polypeptides. Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (""Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2"") protein and the SARS-CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises additional putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics.

To that end, we leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 & SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Of these, we identify the high-scoring subset of human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by both methods, comprising 279 high-confidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins. Notably, the Spike-ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI. Furthermore, the PIPE-Sites algorithm was used to predict the putative subsequence that might mediate each interaction and thereby inform the design of inhibitory polypeptides intended to disrupt the corresponding host-pathogen interactions.

A promising approach for vaccine development is to generate, through codon pair deoptimization, an attenuated virus. This approach carries the advantage that it only requires limited knowledge specific to the virus in question, other than its genome sequence. Therefore, it is well suited for emerging viruses for which we may not have extensive data. We performed comprehensive in silico analyses of several features of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence (e.g., codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotide/junction dinucleotide usage, RNA structure around the frameshift region) in comparison with other members of the coronaviridae family of viruses, the overall human genome, and the transcriptome of specific human tissues such as lung, which are primarily targeted by the virus.

709,Computational Design of Peptides to Block Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein to Human ACE2,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has now become a global pandemic and it continues to spread rapidly worldwide, severely threatening lives and economic stability. Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (-53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID-19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic.","Huang, X.; Pearce, R.; Zhang, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.013607v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.013607v1?rss=1,2020-03-31,2020-03-31,,False

However, the factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood. Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, including goblet cells, club cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. Chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mucus-secreting goblet cells and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking causes a decrease in lung ACE2 levels. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly likely to develop severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they suggest that quitting smoking could lessen coronavirus susceptibility.","Smith, J.

We aimed to investigate the administered medications and intervention times for patients who completely recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This single-center, retrospective, and observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth People's Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Demographic information, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and eight patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively. Findings: All 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96.36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all eight severe-group patients (median treatment: 17.5 days; four received lopinavir/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients (52.72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13.5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all eight in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; two received linezolid). Moreover, seven patients (12.72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and nine (16.36%) with immunomodulators. Interpretation: Given the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered.

714,"The more I fear about COVID-19, the more I wear medical masks: A survey on risk perception and medical masks uses","The legal behaviors in using medical masks in public have been finally promulgated by the Vietnamese Government after 47 days since the WHO declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From a sample of 345 Vietnamese respondents aged from 15 to 47 years, this brief note found that the risk perception of COVID-19 danger significantly increases the likelihood of wearing the medical masks. In addition, there is a weak evidence about the differences in age under the COVID-19 outbreaks. More noticeably, those who use masks before COVID-19 pandemic tend to maintain their behaviors. Our results offer the insightful into Vietnamese citizens responses in terms of using medical masks; even the uses of this method are still controversial.

715,Which Measures are Effective in Containing COVID-19?Empirical Research Based on Prevention and Control Cases in China,"Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only works in cities with higher GDP per capita and population size, while fails in cities with lower GDP per capita and population size. In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative; the rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects. The findings above verify the effectiveness and correctness of the measures implemented in China at present, at the same time, we propose that it is necessary to fully consider the respective characteristics of the two measures, cooperating and complementing each other; what's more, measures should be formulated according to the city's own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention; Finally, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide emotions of the public in a proper way, enhancing public confidence.","Lin, S.; Huang, J.; He, Z.; Zhan, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046110v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046110v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
716,A Machine Learning Model Reveals Older Age and Delayed Hospitalization as Predictors of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19,"Objective: The recent pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and significant mortality. We aim here to identify the risk factors associated with mortality of coronavirus infected persons using a supervised machine learning approach. Research Design and Methods: Clinical data of 1085 cases of COVID-19 from 13th January to 28th February, 2020 was obtained from Kaggle, an online community of Data scientists. 430 cases were selected for the final analysis. Random Forest classification algorithm was implemented on the dataset to identify the important predictors and their effects on mortality. Results: The Area under the ROC curve obtained during model validation on the test dataset was 0.97. Age was the most important variable in predicting mortality followed by the time gap between symptom onset and hospitalization. Conclusions: Patients aged beyond 62 years are at higher risk of fatality whereas hospitalization within 2 days of the onset of symptoms could reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Sarkar, J.; Chakrabarti, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043331v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043331v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
717,An Evaluation of the Vulnerable Physician Workforce in the United States During the Coronavirus Disease-19 Pandemic,"Background: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the healthcare resources of the country, but also poses a personal hazard to healthcare workers, including physicians. To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States. Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years. Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians were 60 years of age or older, 246167 (25.0%) 65 years and older, and 106121 (10.8%) 70 years or older. States in the US reported that a median 5470 licensed physicians (interquartile range [IQR], 2394 to 10108) were 60 years of age or older. Notably, states of North Dakota (n=1180) and Vermont (n = 1215) had the lowest and California (n=50786) and New York (n=31582) the highest number of physicians over the age of 60 years (Figure 1). Across states, the median proportion of physicians aged 60 years and older was 28.9% (IQR, 27.2%, 31.4%), and ranged between 25.9% for Nebraska to 32.6% for New Mexico (Figure 2). Discussion: Older physicians represent a large proportion of the US physician workforce, particularly in states with the worst COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, their exclusion from patient care will be impractical. Optimizing care practices by limiting direct patient contact of physicians vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, potentially by expanding their participation in telehealth may be a strategy to protect them.","Khera, R.; Dhingra, L.

718,How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time,"Doubling Time (DT) is typically calculated for growth curves that show exponential growth, such as the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases day by day. DT represents the time it takes before the number of COVID-19 cases, in a certain country or area, doubles. Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, DT values are continually changing. These changes are influenced by the measures that are recommended by the health authorities and implemented by governments. After the governmental shutdowns of Nordic Countries that were announced around the 12th of March 2020, I followed the development of the DT in the region. Governments put in place measure never before experienced during peace time; home working, closed schools and kindergartens, travel bans and social distancing. But does it work? The initial set of results following the shutdown are encouraging, demonstrating a trend towards slower growth; however, this could be reversed if the measures that are in place now are abandoned too early. Premature optimism can be very costly. This paper explains how to monitor growth in real time and evaluate whether the implemented measures are successful.","Stangeland, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20045187v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20045187v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

Part 1 - Face masks, eye protection and person distancing: systematic review and meta-analysis","Abstract OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of eye protection, face masks, or person distancing on interrupting or reducing the spread of respiratory viruses. DESIGN: Update of a Cochrane review that included a meta-analysis of observational studies during the SARS outbreak of 2003. DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials from the previous review; search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from October 2010 up to 1 April 2020; and forward and backward citation analysis. DATA SELECTION: Randomised and cluster-randomised trials of people of any age, testing the use of eye protection, face masks, or person distancing against standard practice, or a similar physical barrier. Outcomes included any acute respiratory illness and its related consequences. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Six authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. We used a generalised inverse variance method for pooling using a random-effects model and reported results with risk ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). RESULTS: We included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50). There was no difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators: for ILI (Risk Ratio 0.83, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.08), for influenza (Risk Ratio 1.02, 95%CI 0.73 to 1.43). Harms were poorly reported and limited to discomfort with lower compliance. The only trial testing quarantining workers with household ILI contacts found a reduction in ILI cases, but increased risk of quarantined workers contracting influenza. All trials were conducted during seasonal ILI activity. CONCLUSIONS: Most included trials had poor design, reporting and sparse events. There was insufficient evidence to provide a recommendation on the use of facial barriers without other measures. We found insufficient evidence for a difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators and limited evidence to support effectiveness of quarantine. Based on observational evidence from the previous SARS epidemic included in the previous version of our Cochrane review we recommend the use of masks combined with other measures.","Jefferson, T.; Jones, M.; Al Ansari, L.

720,Evaluating COVID-19 Public Health Messaging in Italy: Self-Reported Compliance and Growing Mental Health Concerns,"Purpose: The COVID-19 death-rate in Italy continues to climb, surpassing that in every other country. We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now should move from explaining that citizens should stay at home to what they can do at home. We need interventions that make staying at home and following public health protocols more desirable, or possibly even fun. These interventions could include virtual social interactions, such as online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, among others - all designed to reduce the boredom of being socially isolated for long periods of time and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations. Interventions like these will grow in importance as the crisis wears on around the world, and staying inside wears on people.","Barari, S.; Caria, S.; Davola, A.; Falco, P.; Fetzer, T.; Fiorin, S.; Hensel, L.; Ivchenko, A.; Jachimowicz, J.; King, G.; Kraft-Todd, G.; Ledda, A.; MacLennan, M.; Mutoi, L.; Pagani, C.; Reutskaja, E.; Slepoi, F.

721,A COVID-19 Infection Risk Model for Frontline Health Care Workers,"The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift. Moreover, the formulated model can be used for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings.","Dy, L.

722,Basic prediction methodology for covid-19: estimation and sensitivity considerations,"The purpose of the present paper is to present simple estimation and prediction methods for basic quantities in an emerging epidemic like the ongoing covid-10 pandemic. The simple methods have the advantage that relations between basic quantities become more transparent, thus shedding light to which quantities have biggest impact on predictions, with the additional conclusion that uncertainties in these quantities carry over to high uncertainty also in predictions. A simple non-parametric prediction method for future cumulative case fatalities, as well as future cumulative incidence of infections (assuming a given infection fatality risk f), is presented. The method uses cumulative reported case fatalities up to present time as input data. It is also described how the introduction of preventive measures of a given magnitude{rho} will affect the two incidence predictions, using basic theory of epidemic models. This methodology is then reversed, thus enabling estimation of the preventive magnitude{rho} , and of the resulting effective reproduction number RE. However, the effects of preventive measures only start affecting case fatalities some 3-4 weeks later, so estimates are only available after this time has elapsed. The methodology is applicable in the early stage of an outbreak, before, say, 10% of the community have been infected. Beside giving simple estimation and prediction tools for an ongoing epidemic, another important conclusion lies in the observation that the two quantities f (infection fatality risk) and{rho} (the magnitude of preventive measures) have very big impact on predictions. Further, both of these quantities currently have very high uncertainty: current estimates of f lie in the range 0.2% up to 2% ([9], [7]), and the overall effect of several combined preventive measures is clearly very uncertain. The two main findings from the paper are hence that, a) any prediction containing f, and/or some preventive measures, contain a large amount of uncertainty (which is usually not acknowledged well enough), and b) obtaining more accurate estimates of in particular f, should be highly prioritized. Seroprevalence testing of random samples in a community where the epidemic has ended are urgently needed.","Britton, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045575v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045575v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

A sensitive and accurate diagnosis method will substantially help to control disease expansion. Here, we developed a chemiluminescence-immunoassay method based on the recombinant nucleocapsid antigen and the magnetic beads for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and surveillance of antibody changing pattern. Serums from 29 healthy individuals, 51 tuberculosis patients, and 79 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients were employed to evaluate the performance of this approach. Compared to the IgM testing, the IgG testing was more reliable in which it identified 65 SARS-CoV-2 infections from the 79 confirmed patients and only two false-positive cases from the 80 control group with a sensitivity and specificity reaching 82.28% and 97.5%, respectively. However, only a slight difference (not statistically significant) in the detected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections was observed between the IgM and IgG testing manner in patients at a different time of onset of disease. A performance comparison between an ELISA kit using the same nucleocapsid antigen and our chemiluminescence method was undertaken. The same false-positive cases were seen in both methods from the paired control group, while ELISA kit can only detect half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections from paired SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients group than that of the chemiluminescence method, indicating a higher performance for the chemiluminescence-immunoassay approach.

726,The psychological distress and coping styles in the early stages of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic in the general mainland Chinese population: a web-based survey,"Background As the epidemic outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), general population may experience psychological distress. Evidence has suggested that negative coping styles may be related to subsequent mental illness. Therefore, we investigate the general population's psychological distress and coping styles in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods A cross-sectional battery of surveys was conducted from February 1-4, 2020. The Kessler 6 psychological distress scale, the simplified coping style questionnaire and a general information questionnaire were administered on-line to a convenience sample of 1599 in China. Spearman's correlation was used to measure the correlations among category variables. Results General population's psychological distress were significant differences based on age, marriage, epidemic contact characteristics, concern with media reports, and perceived impacts of the epidemic outbreak (all p <0.001) except gender (p=0.316). Those with a history of visiting Wuhan and a history of epidemics occurring in the community, more concern with media reports, perceived more severe impacts and negative coping style had a higher level of psychological distress, which was significantly positively correlated with a history of visiting Wuhan (r=0.548, p<0.001), a history of epidemics occurring in the community (r=0.219, p<0.001), and concern with media reports (r=0.192, p<0.001). Coping styles were significantly different across all category variables (all p <0.001), and negatively correlated with other category variables (all p<0.01) except age and marriage. Psychological distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style (r=-0.573, p<0.01). Conclusions In the early stages of COVID-19, general population with epidemic contact characteristics, excessive concern with media reports, and perceived more severe impacts have higher levels of psychological distress. Psychological distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style. Interventions should be implemented early, especially for those population with a high level of psychological distress and/or with a negative coping style.","Wang, H.-y.; Xia, Q.; Xiong, Z.-z.; Li, Z.-x.; Xiang, W.-y.; Yuan, Y.-w.; Liu, Y.-y.; li, z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045807v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045807v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
727,Changing transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in China: a nationwide population-based piecewise mathematical modelling study,"Background: The first case of COVID-19 atypical pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China on December 1, 2019. Since then, at least 33 other countries have been affected and there is a possibility of a global outbreak. A tremendous amount of effort has been made to understand its transmission dynamics; however, the temporal and spatial transmission heterogeneity and changing epidemiology have been mostly ignored. The epidemic mechanism of COVID-19 remains largely unclear. Methods: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in China and daily population movement data from Wuhan to other cities were obtained and analyzed. To describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 at different spatio-temporal scales, we used a three-stage continuous-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) meta-population model based on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of each stage: 1) local epidemic from December 1, 2019 to January 9, 2020; 2) long-distance spread due to the Spring Festival travel rush from January 10 to 22, 2020; and 3) intra-provincial transmission from January 23, 2020 when travel restrictions were imposed. Together with the basic reproduction number (R_0) for mathematical modelling, we also considered the variation in infectivity and introduced the controlled reproduction number (R_c) by assuming that exposed individuals to be infectious; we then simulated the future spread of COVID across Wuhan and all the provinces in mainland China. In addition, we built a novel source tracing algorithm to infer the initial exposed number of individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020, to estimate the number of infections early during this epidemic. Findings: The spatial patterns of disease spread were heterogeneous. The estimated controlled reproduction number (R_c) in the neighboring provinces of Hubei province were relatively large, and the nationwide reproduction number (except for Hubei) ranged from 0.98 to 2.74 with an average of 1.79 (95% CI 1.77-1.80). Infectivity was significantly greater for exposed than infectious individuals, and exposed individuals were predicted to have become the major source of infection after January 23. For the epidemic process, most provinces reached their epidemic peak before February 10, 2020. It is expected that the maximum number of infections will be approached by the end of March. The final infectious size is estimated to be about 58,000 for Wuhan, 20,800 for the rest of Hubei province, and 17,000 for the other provinces in mainland China. Moreover, the estimated number of the exposed individuals is much greater than the officially reported number of infectious individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020. Interpretation: The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been changing over time and were heterogeneous across regions. There was a substantial underestimation of the number of exposed individuals in Wuhan early in the epidemic, and the Spring Festival travel rush played an important role in enhancing and accelerating the spread of COVID-19. However, China's unprecedented large-scale travel restrictions quickly reduced R_c. The next challenge for the control of COVID-19 will be the second great population movement brought by removing these travel restrictions.","Hou, J.; Hong, J.; Ji, B.; Dong, B.; Chen, Y.; Ward, M.

728,Genetic Profiles in Pharmacogenes Indicate Personalized Drug Therapy for COVID-19,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic currently. Many drugs showed potential for COVID-19 therapy. However, genetic factors which can lead to different drug efficiency and toxicity among populations are still undisclosed in COVID-19 therapy. Methods: We selected 67 potential drugs for COVID-19 therapy (DCTs) from clinical guideline and clinical trials databases. 313 pharmaco-genes related to these therapeutic drugs were included. Variation information in 125,748 exomes were collected for racial differences analyses. The expression level of pharmaco-genes in single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 17 healthy adults. Results: Pharmacogenes, including CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, ALB, CYP3A5, were involved in the process of more than multi DCTs. 224 potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) of DCTs were predicted, while 112 of them have been reported. Racial discrepancy of common nonsynonymous mutations was found in pharmacogenes including: VDR, ITPA, G6PD, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 which related to DCTs including ribavirin, -interferon, chloroquine and lopinavir. Moreover, ACE2, the target of 2019-nCoV, was only found in parts of lung cells, which makes drugs like chloroquine that prevent virus binding to ACE2 more specific than other targeted drugs such as camostat mesylate. Conclusions: At least 17 drugs for COVID-19 therapy with predictable pharmacogenes should be carefully utilized in risk races which are consisted of more risk allele carriers. At least 29 drugs with potential of DDIs are reported to be affected by other DDIs, they should be replaced by similar drugs without interaction if it is possible. Drugs which specifically targeted to infected cells with ACE2 such as chloroquine are preferred in COVID-19 therapy.","Wang, L.-Y.; Cui, J.-J.; OuYang, Q.-Y.; Zhan, Y.; Wang, Y.-M.; Xu, X.-Y.; Guo, C.-X.; Yin, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041350v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041350v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
729,In-host Modelling of COVID-19 Kinetics in Humans,"COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the impact of emergent pathogens as a major threat for human health. The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics. Based on the target cell model, SARS-CoV-2 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30 days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 is consistent to the values of influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.","Hernandez Vargas, E.

730,Causal empirical estimates suggest COVID-19 transmission rates are highly seasonal,"Nearly every country is now combating the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1{degrees}C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter.","Carleton, T.; Meng, K.

731,Negligible Risk of the COVID-19 Resurgence Caused by Work Resuming in China (outside Hubei): a Statistical Probability Study,"The COVID-19 outbreak in China appears to reach the late stage since late February 2020, and a stepwise restoration of economic operations is implemented. Risk assessment for such economic restoration is of significance. Here we estimated the probability of COVID-19 resurgence caused by work resuming in typical provinces/cities, and found that such probability is very limited (<5% for all the regions except Beijing).

732,Temperature dependence of COVID-19 transmission,"The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion, with the number of cases N reasonably well fit by N et, in many countries. We analyze the rate  in 25 different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate  and the average temperature T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. Fitting with a linear behavior (T), we find evidence for a decreasing growth rate as a function of T. However, a decrease in the growth rate is visible also in the very low-T data. Going beyond a linear model, a peak at about (9.5{+/-}2.6){degrees}C seems to be present in the data. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the next cold season.","Notari, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044529v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044529v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
733,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"A standard SEIR-type compartment model, parameterised for New Zealand, was used to simulate the spread of Covid19 in New Zealand and to test the effectiveness of various control strategies. Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbreaks under immediate control when needed. This is as yet untested even for a combination of national interventions including case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing and closure of schools and universities. Although there are disadvantages to both types of approach, suppression has the advantage of buying time until a vaccine and/or treatment become available and allowing NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. A combination of successful suppression, strong border measures, and widespread contact tracing and testing resulting in containment could allow periods when control measures can be relaxed, but only if cases are reduced to a handful.","James, A.; Hendy, S.

734,Analysis of the scientific literature in the first 30 Days of the novel coronavirus outbreak.,"Introduction: Recent events highlight how emerging and re-emerging pathogens are becoming global challenges for public health. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus has emerged. This has suddenly turned out into global health concern. Objectives: Aim of this research is to focus on the bibliometric aspects in order to measure what is published in the first 30-days of a global epidemic outbreak Methods: We searched PubMed database in order to find all relevant studies in the first 30-days from the first publication. Results: From the initial 442 identified articles, 234 were read in-extenso. The majority of papers come from China, UK and USA. 63.7% of the papers were commentaries, editorials and reported data and only 17.5% of the sources used data directly collected on the field. Topics mainly addressed were epidemiology, preparedness and generic discussion. NNR showed a reduction for both the objectives assessed from January to February. Conclusions: Diagnosis and effective preventive and therapeutic measures were the fields in which more research is still needed. The vast majority of scientific literature in the first 30-days of an epidemic outbreak is based on reported data rather than primary data. Nevertheless, the scientific statements and public health decisions rely on these data.","GORI, D.; Boetto, E.; Fantini, M.

735,Effects of temperature on COVID-19 transmission,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), it was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China and has resulted in the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. As of March 1, 2020, 79,968 patients in China and 7169 outside of China had tested positive for COVID19 and a mortality rate of 3.6% has been observed amongst Chinese patients. Its primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel or in aerosols for upto 3 hours and is relatively more stable than the known human coronaviruses. It is stable in faeces at room temperature for at least 1-2 days and can be stable in infected patients for up to 4 days. Heat at 56 degree Celsius kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes. Thus, temperature is an important factor in survival of COVID19 virus and this article focuses on understanding the relationship between temperature and COVID19 transmission from the data available between January-March 2020.","pawar, s.; Stanam, A.; Chaudhari, M.; Rayudu, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20044461v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20044461v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
736,Early Spread of SARS-Cov-2 in the Icelandic Population,"BACKGROUND Limited data exist on how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads in the general population. METHODS We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing: targeted testing of high-risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 340 individuals. RESULTS On March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3% for targeted testing (P=1.6e-9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031). Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e-9). SARS-CoV-2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were A2a1 and A2a2 derived from Italian and Austrian skiing areas, but in the later targeted testing went down to 30.6% and were overtaken by A1a and A2a, the most common clades in the population screening. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 has spread widely in Iceland outside of the high-risk groups. Several strains cause these infections and their relative contribution changed rapidly. Children and females are less vulnerable than adults and males. To contain the pandemic we must increase the scope of the testing.","Gudbjartsson, D. F.; Helgason, A.; Jonsson, H.; Magnusson, O.

737,Advice from a systems-biology model of the Corona epidemics,"Using standard systems biology methodologies a 14-compartment dynamic model was developed for the Corona virus epidemic. The model predicts that : (i) it will be impossible to limit lockdown intensity such that sufficient herd immunity develops for this epidemic to die down, (ii) the death toll from the SARS-CoV-2 virus decreases very strongly with increasing intensity of the lockdown, but (iii) the duration of the epidemic increases at first with that intensity and then decreases again, such that (iv) it may be best to begin with selecting a lockdown intensity beyond the intensity that leads to the maximum duration, (v) an intermittent lock down strategy should also work and be more acceptable socially and economically, (vi) an initially intensive but adaptive lockdown strategy should be most efficient, both in terms of its low number casualties and shorter duration, (vii) such an adaptive lockdown strategy offers the advantage of being robust to unexpected imports of the virus, e.g. due to international travel, (viii) the eradication strategy may still be superior as it leads to even fewer deaths and a shorter period of economic lockdown maximum, but should have the adaptive strategy as backup in case of unexpected inflation imports (ix) earlier detection of infections is perhaps the most effective way in which the epidemic can be controlled more readily, whilst waiting for vaccines.","Westerhoff, H.

738,Mitigation and herd immunity strategy for COVID-19 is likely to fail,"On the basis of a semi-realistic SIR microsimulation for Germany and Poland, we show that the R0 parameter interval for which the COVID-19 epidemic stays overcritical but below the capacity limit of the health care system to reach herd immunity is so narrow that a successful implementation of this strategy is likely to fail. Our microsimulation is based on official census data and involves household composition and age distribution as the main population structure variables. Outside household contacts are characterised by an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter of the model. For a subcritical domain we compute the time till extinction and prevalence as a function of the initial number of infected individuals and R*. For the Polish city of Wroclaw we also discuss the combined impact of testing coverage and contact reduction.

739,Forecasting the Worldwide Spread of COVID-19 based on Logistic Model and SEIR Model,"Background: With the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a sudden case increase in late February 2020 led to deep concern globally. Italy, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, the US and Japan are probably the countries with the most severe outbreaks. Collecting epidemiological data and predicting epidemic trends are important for the development and measurement of public intervention strategies. Epidemic prediction results yielded by different mathematical models are inconsistent; therefore, we sought to compare different models and their prediction results to generate objective conclusions. Methods: We used the number of cases reported from January 23 to March 20, 2020, to estimate the possible spread size and peak time of COVID-19, especially in 8 high-risk countries. The logistic growth model, basic SEIR model and adjusted SEIR model were adopted for prediction. Given that different model inputs may infer different model outputs, we implemented three model predictions with three scenarios of epidemic development. Results: When comparing all 8 countries short-term prediction results and peak predictions, the differences among the models were relatively large. The logistic growth model estimated a smaller epidemic size than the basic SERI model did; however, once we added parameters that considered the effects of public health interventions and control measures, the adjusted SERI model results demonstrated a considerably rapid deceleration of epidemic development. Our results demonstrated that contact rate, quarantine scale, and the initial quarantine time and length are important factors in controlling epidemic size and length. Conclusions: We demonstrated a comparative assessment of the predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak in eight high-risk countries using multiple methods. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time as well as simulating the effects of public health interventions, the intent of this paper is to help clarify the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that the quick detection of cases, sufficient implementation of quarantine and public self-protection behaviors are critical to slow down the epidemic.","Zhou, X.; Hong, N.; Ma, Y.; He, J.; Jiang, H.; Liu, C.; Shan, G.; Su, L.; Zhu, W.; Long, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044289v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044289v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

This meta-analysis is to analyze the correlation between hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Available data from PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, WanFang Database and VIP Database, were analyzed using a fixed effects model meta-analysis to derive overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and Begg's were used to assess publication bias. Findings: Of 182 articles found following our initial search, we assessed 34 full-text articles, of which 9 articles with 1936 COVID-19 patients met all selection criteria for our meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity between studies. There were significant correlations between COVID-19 severity and hypertension [OR=2.3 [95% CI (1.76, 3.00), P<0.01], diabetes [OR=2.67, 95% CI (1.91, 3.74), P<0.01], coronary heart disease [OR=2.85 [95% CI (1.68, 4.84), P<0.01]. Most of the studies in the funnel plot are on the upper part and few on the base part, and are roughly symmetrical left and right. Begg's test: hypertension (Z=-0.1, P=1.0), diabetes (Z=0.73, P=0.466), coronary heart disease (Z=0.38, P=0.707), all found no publication bias. Interpretation: Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease can affect the severity of COVID-19.

741,Development and external validation of a prognostic multivariable model on admission for hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has developed rapidly and the ability to stratify the most vulnerable patients is vital. However, routinely used severity scoring systems are often low on diagnosis, even in non-survivors. Therefore, clinical prediction models for mortality are urgently required. Methods: We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slopes and plots. Findings: The final model included age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and SpO2 as independent predictors of mortality. Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0.89) and external (c=0.98) validation. Internal calibration was excellent (calibration slope=1). External validation showed some over-prediction of risk in low-risk individuals and under-prediction of risk in high-risk individuals prior to recalibration. Recalibration of the intercept and slope led to excellent performance of the model in independent data. Interpretation: COVID-19 is a new disease and behaves differently from common critical illnesses. This study provides a new prediction model to identify patients with lethal COVID-19. Its practical reliance on commonly available parameters should improve usage of limited healthcare resources and patient survival rate.","Xie, J.; Hungerford, D.; Chen, H.; Abrams, S.

742,Symptom-Based Isolation Policies: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Outbreaks of Influenza and COVID-19,"Background: Controlling the transmission of respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 is a critical public health priority. Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the population infected) under one or more days of fever-based isolation. Results: Using the model we find evidence that symptom-based isolation policies could reduce the attack rates of both influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks, and flatten the outbreak curves. Specifically, we found that across a range of influenza scenarios, a CDC-recommended policy of one day isolation following fever can reduce the attack rate from 27% of the population to 12%, and to 3% if the isolation is extended to two days. In COVID-19 transmission, we estimate that implementing one day post-fever isolation would reduce the attack rate from 79% to 71%, and there is possible benefit from isolation for six days. In both influenza and COVID-19, the policies are predicted to reduce the peak number of infected but not shorten the outbreak duration. Conclusions: Symptom-based isolation could be an important tool to control influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, and potentially other settings. We recommend that schools implement a post-fever isolation policy of two days for influenza and six days for COVID-19.","Burns, A.; Gutfraind, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044750v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044750v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
743,Analysis and Prediction of False Negative Results for SARS-CoV-2 Detection with Pharyngeal Swab Specimen in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Study,"Background: False negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection pose threats to COVID-19 patients and medical workers alike. Objective: To develop multivariate models to determine clinical characteristics that contribute to false negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, and use them to predict false negative results as well as time windows for testing positive. Design: Retrospective Cohort Study (Ethics number of Tongji Hospital: No. IRBID: TJ-20200320) Setting: A database of outpatients in Tongji Hospital (University Hospital) from 15 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. Patients: 1,324 outpatients with COVID-19 Measurements: Clinical information on CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinic symptoms were collected. A multivariate logistic regression was used to explain and predict false negative testing results of SARS-CoV-2 detection. A multivariate accelerated failure model was used to analyze and predict delayed time windows for testing positive. Results: Of the 1,324 outpatients who diagnosed of COVID-19, 633 patients tested positive in their first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (47.8%), with a mean age of 51 years (SD=14.9); the rest, which had a mean age of 47 years (SD=15.4), tested negative in the first test. Ground glass opacity in a CT imaging report was associated with a lower chance of false negatives (aOR, 0.56), and reduced the length of time window for testing positive by 26%. Consolidation was associated with a higher chance of false negatives (aOR, 1.57), and extended the length of time window for testing positive by 44%. In blood routine tests, basophils (aOR, 1.28) and eosinophils (aOR, 1.29) were associated with a higher chance of false negatives, and were found to extend the time window for testing positive by 23% and 41%, respectively. Age and gender also affected the significantly. Limitation: Data were generated in a large single-center study. Conclusion: Testing outcome and positive window of SARS-CoV-2 detection for COVID-19 patients were associated with CT imaging results, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms. Taking into account relevant information in CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms helped reduce a false negative testing outcome. The predictive AFT model, what we believe to be one of the first statistical models for predicting time window of SARS-CoV-2 detection, could help clinicians improve the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnosis, and hence, optimizes the timing of nucleic acid detection and alleviates the shortage of nucleic acid detection kits around the world.

745,Prognostic factors for COVID-19 pneumonia progression to severe symptom based on the earlier clinical features: a retrospective analysis,"Background Approximately 15-20% of COVID-19 patients will develop severe pneumonia, about 10 % of which will die if not properly managed. Methods 125 COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were classified into mild (93 cases) and severe (32 cases) groups, basing on their 3 to 7-days clinical outcomes. Patients' gender, age, comorbid with underlying diseases, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests on admission were collected and subsequently analyzed with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods. Finally, we evaluate their prognostic values with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results Seventeen factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups. Next, only four factors, including the comorbid with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP >10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH >250U/liter), were found to be independently associated with the later disease development. Prognostic value analysis by ROC indicated that individual factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia, but that the combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH significantly increase the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 0.941, and specificity= 0.902). Three- or four-factors combinations, including elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, further increased the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA post-admission could independently predict the severe illness occurrence. Conclusions General clinical characteristics and laboratory tests, such as combinations consisting of elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, and detectable viral RNA in serum post-admission could provide high confident prognostic value for identifying potential severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","Huang, H.; Cai, S.; Li, Y.; Li, Y.; Fan, Y.; Li, L.; Lei, C.; Tang, X.; Hu, F.; Li, F.; Deng, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20045989v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20045989v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

747,Electrophysiology in the time of coronavirus: coping with the great wave.,"Aims: To chart the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activity of interventional electrophysiology services in affected regions. Methods: We reviewed the electrophysiology laboratory records in 3 affected cities: Wenzhou in China, Milan in Italy and London, United Kingdom. We interviewed electrophysiologists in each centre to gather information on the impact of the pandemic on working patterns and on the health of staff members. Results: There was a striking decline in interventional electrophysiology activity in each of the centres. The decline occurred within a week of the recognition of widespread community transmission of the virus in each region and shows a striking correlation with the national figures for new diagnoses of COVID-19 in each case. During the period of restriction, work-flow dropped to <5% of normal, consisting of emergency cases only. In 2 of 3 centres, electrophysiologists were redeployed to perform emergency work outside electrophysiology. Among the centres studied, only Wenzhou has seen a recovery from the restrictions in activity. Following an intense nationwide program of public health interventions, local transmission of COVID-19 ceased to be detectable after February 18th allowing the electrophysiology service to resume with a strict testing regime for all patients. Conclusion: Interventional electrophysiology is vulnerable to closure in times of great social difficulty including the COVID-19 pandemic. Intense public health intervention can permit suppression of local disease transmission allowing resumption of some normal activity.","Li, J.; Mazzone, P.; Leung, L.; Lin, W.; D'Angelo, G.; Ma, J.; Li, J.; Akhtar, Z.; Li, Y.; Della Bella, P.

Here, we report an in-flight transmission cluster of COVID-19 and describe the clinical characteristics of these patients. Methods: After a flight, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was reported in 12 patients. Ten patients were admitted to the designated hospital. Data were collected from 25th January to 28th February 2020. Clinical information was retrospectively collected. Results: All patients are passengers without flight attendants. The median age was 33 years, and 70% were females. None was admitted to intensive care unit, and no patients succumbed through 28th February. The median incubation period was 3.0 days and from illness onset to hospital admission was 2 days. The most common symptom was fever. Two patients were asymptomatic and negative for chest CT scan throughout the disease course. On admission, initial RT-PCR were positive in 9 patients, however initial chest CT were positive in only half patients. The median lung total severity score of chest CT was 6. Notably, Crazy-Paving pattern, pleural effusion, and ground-glass nodules were also seen. Conclusion: It is potential for COVID-19 transmission by airplane, but the symptoms are mild. Passengers and attendants must be protected during the flight.","Yang, N.; Shen, Y.; Shi, C.; Ma, A. H.

749,Potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea,"On January 20, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in South Korea. After a rapid outbreak, the number of incident cases has been consistently decreasing since early March; this decrease has been widely attributed to its intensive testing. We report here on the likely role of social distancing in reducing transmission in South Korea. Our analysis suggests that transmission may still be persisting in some regions.","Park, S.

750,A modified SEIR model to predict the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain: simulating control scenarios and multi-scale epidemics,"After the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follow an evolution similar to the isolation of 1,5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum of over 1.4M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents a 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid an Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than halve the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre- and post-interventions also begins to suggest substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions.","Lopez, L.

751,Mobility traces and spreading of COVID-19,"We use human mobility models, for which we are experts, and attach a virus infection dynamics to it, for which we are not experts but have taken it from the literature, including recent publications. This results in a virus spreading dynamics model. The results should be verified, but because of the current time pressure, we publish them in their current state. Recommendations for improvement are welcome. We come to the following conclusions: 1. Complete lockdown works. About 10 days after lockdown, the infection dynamics dies down. This assumes that lockdown is complete, which can be guaranteed in the simulation, but not in reality. Still, it gives strong support to the argument that it is never too late for complete lockdown. 2. As a rule of thumb, we would suggest complete lockdown no later than once 10% of hospital capacities available for COVID-19 are in use, and possibly much earlier. This is based on the following insights: a. Even after lockdown, the infection dynamics continues at home, leading to another tripling of the cases before the dynamics is slowed. b. There will be many critical cases coming from people who were infected before lockdown. Because of the exponential growth dynamics, their number will be large. c. Researchers with more detailed disease progression models should improve upon these statements. 3. Our simulations say that complete removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces and during leisure activities will not be enough to sufficiently slow down the infection dynamics. It would have been better, but still not sufficient, if initiated earlier. 4. Infections in public transport play an important role. In the simulations shown later, removing infections in the public transport system reduces the infection speed and the height of the peak by approximately 20%. Evidently, this depends on the infection parameters, which are not well known. -- This does not point to reducing public transport capacities as a reaction to the reduced demand, but rather use it for lower densities of passengers and thus reduced infection rates. 5. In our simulations, removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces, leisure activities, and in public transport may barely have been sufficient to control the infection dynamics if implemented early on. Now according to our simulations it is too late for this, and (even) harsher measures will have to be initiated until possibly a return to such a restrictive, but still somewhat functional regime will again be possible. Evidently, all of these results have to be taken with care. They are based on preliminary infection parameters taken from the literature, used inside a model that has more transport/movement details than all others that we are aware of but still not enough to describe all aspects of reality, and suffer from having to write computer code under time pressure. Optimally, they should be confirmed independently. Short of that, given current knowledge we believe that they provide justification for ""complete lockdown"" at the latest when about 10% of available hospital capacities for COVID-19 are in use (and possibly earlier; we are no experts of hospital capabilities). What was not investigated in detail in our simulations was contact tracing, i.e. tracking down the infection chains and moving all people along infection chains into quarantine. The case of Singapore has so far shown that this may be successful. Preliminary simulation of that tactic shows that it is difficult to implement for COVID-19, since the incubation time is rather long, people are contagious before they feel sick, or maybe never feel sufficiently sick at all. We will investigate in future work if and how contact tracing can be used together with a restrictive, but not totally locked down regime. When opening up after lockdown, it would be important to know the true fraction of people who are already immune, since that would slow down the infection dynamics by itself. For Wuhan, the currently available numbers report that only about 0.1% of the population was infected, which would be very far away from ""herd immunity"". However, there have been and still may be many unknown infections.","Muller, S.

752,"Clinical features and outcomes of 197 adult discharged patients with COIVD-19 in Yichang, Hubei","Purpose To investigate the epidemiology and clinical features of discharged adult patients with COVID-19 in Yichang. Method The retrospective study recruited 197 cases of COVID-19 discharged from Yichang Central People's Hospital and Yichang Third People's Hospital from Jan 17 to Feb 26, 2020. All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR or chest computer tomography (CT).The survivors were followed up until March 4,2020. Clinical data, including demographic characteristic, presentation, exposure history, laboratory examination, radiology and prognosis were enrolled and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software. Results There were 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 in this study. Statistical analysis indicated that the average age was 55.94 years, and female patients were 50.3%. Those patients mainly resided in urban with exposure history in 2 weeks. Fever, cough and weakness were the common symptoms. Leucocytes were mainly normal or decreased in 185 patents, both lymphocytes and eosinophils reduced, the ratios were 56.9% and 50.3%, respectively. On the contrary, lactate dehydrogenases raised in 65 patients. C-reactive protein elevated in the most of patients. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 63.5%. Chest CT indicated that bilateral patchy shadows were the most common imaging manifestations.169 patients recovered and transferred to a designated hospital for observation, and the others turned worst and died of acute respiratory failure. Conclusion COIVD-19 infection have become a life-threaten public health problem, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was limited. Chest CT scan was recommended for the suspected patients. Moreover, lymphocytopenia and eosinophils declining without leukocytes increasing may be considered as a useful evidence for the diagnosis.","Zhou, F.; Yu, X.; Tong, X.; Zhang, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20041426v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20041426v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
753,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"Relevant pandemic-spread scenario simulations provide guiding principles for containment and mitigation policy developments. Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. Some of the model parameters have been fitted to the reported cases outside of China1 from January 22 to March 12 of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The other parameters were chosen in a plausible range to the best of our knowledge. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in six different scenarios. Social distancing or increased testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared to a situation without mitigation. We find that mass-testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economical costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the Covid-19 pandemic. The website corona-lab.ch provides an interactive simulation tool based on the presented model.","Jenny, P.; Jenny, D.

754,Prediction of the time evolution of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Italy by a Gauss Error Function and Monte Carlo simulations,"In this paper are presented predictions on the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy of the Covid-19 pandemic based on official data and on the use of a function of the type of a Gauss Error Function as a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the Error Function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, i.e., to the change in sign of its second derivative (that is the change from acceleration to deceleration) as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations in the attempt to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease of the number of daily positive cases. Although, official data have been used, these predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach, since those predictions are based on statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as medical, social distancing, virologic, epidemiological, etc.) or models of contamination diffusion.","Ciufolini, I.; Paolozzi, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045104v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045104v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

CT acts as an important method of diagnosis. However, human-based interpretation of CT imaging is time consuming. More than that, substantial inter-observer-variation cannot be ignored. We aim at developing a diagnostic tool for artificial intelligence (AI)-based classification of CT images for recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung. Experimental Design: In this study, images were retrospectively collected and prospectively analyzed using machine learning. CT scan images of the lung that show or do not show COVID-19 were used to train and validate a classification framework based on convolutional neural network. Five conditions including COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung were evaluated. Training and validation set of images were collected from Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital whereas test set of images were collected from Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University and the fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Results: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI framework were reported. For test dataset, accuracies for recognizing normal lung, COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis were 99.4%, 98.8%, 98.5%, 98.3%, and 98.6%, respectively. For the test dataset, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of recognizing COVID-19 were 98.8%, 98.2%, 98.9%, 94.5%, and 99.7%, respectively. Conclusions: The performance of the proposed AI framework has excellent performance of recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung, which also has balanced sensitivity and specificity.","Fu, M.; Yi, S.-L.; Zeng, Y.; Ye, F.; Li, Y.; Dong, X.; Ren, Y.-D.; Luo, L.; Pan, J.-S.; Zhang, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046045v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046045v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
756,Children are unlikely to have been the primary source of household SARS-CoV-2 infections,"BACKGROUND: Since its identification on the 7th of January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to more than 180 countries worldwide, causing >11,000 deaths. At present, viral disease and transmission amongst children is incompletely understood. Specifically, there is concern that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters. METHODS: We performed an observational study analysing literature published between December 2019 and March 2020 of the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms. FINDINGS: Drawing on studies from China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children. These ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease. Of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified, 9.7% (3/31) were identified as having a paediatric index case. This is in contrast other zoonotic infections (namely H5N1 influenza virus) where 54% (30/56) of transmission clusters identified children as the index case.

We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Matrajt, L.; Leung, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20044891v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20044891v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
758,Dispersion of a new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by airlines in 2020: Temporal estimates of the outbreak in Mexico.,"On January 23, 2020, China imposed a quarantine on the city of Wuhan to contain the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Regardless of this measure the new infection has spread to several countries around the world. Here, we developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by the airline routes and we give estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreaks to the different cities. In this work we show an analysis of the dispersion of this infection to other cities by airlines based on the classic model the Kermack and McKendrick complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes which represent the cities and edges which represent the airline routes. We do several numerical simulations to estimate the date of arrival to different cities starting the infection at Wuhan, China and to show the robustness of the estimation respect to changes in the epidemiological parameters and to changes on the graph. We use Mexico City as an example. In this case, our estimate of the arrival time is between March 20 and March 30, 2020. This analysis is limited to the analysis of dispersion by airlines, so this estimate should be taken as an overestimate since the infection can arrive by other means. This model estimates the arrival of the infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and March 30. This estimation gives a time period to implement and strengthen preventive measures aimed at the general population, as well as to strengthen hospital infrastructure and training of human resources in health.","Cruz-Pacheco, G.; Bustamante-Castaneda, F.

759,Evaluation the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays for detection of novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) causing an outbreak of pneumonia (COVID-19),"Background: The spread of an novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously named 2019-nCoV) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. Elucidating the diagnostic value of different methods, especially the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection is helpful for improving the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, providing timely treatment, and differentiating the infected cases from the healthy, thus preventing further epidemics. Methods: Medical records from 38 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 22, 2020 to February 28, 2020 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Specimens including throat swabs, sputum and serum were collected during the hospitalization period, viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured respectively. The detectability of different methods as well as the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies test for SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. Results: Among 38 patients, the total seropositive rate for IgM and IgG was 50.0% and 92.1%, respectively. Two patients remained seronegative throughout the course of illness. In the early phase of illness, the RNA test for sputum specimens possessed the highest detectability(92.3%), followed by the the RNA test for throat swabs (69.2%), and the antibodies assays presented lower positive rates(IgM, 23.0%, IgG, 53.8%). While, the sensitivity of antibodies assays overtook that of RNA test since day 8 after onset (IgM, 50.0%; IgG, 87.5%). Of note, the positive rate of throat swabs was only 13.0% for cases in later phase([&ge;]15 d.a.o), and the sensitivities of IgM and IgG rose to 52.2% and 91.3%, respectively. Combined use of antibodies assay and qRT-PCR at the same time was able to improve the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, especially for the throat swabs group at the later stage of illness. Moreover, most of these cases with undetectable viral RNA in throat swabs specimens at the early stage of illness were able to be IgM/IgG seropositive after 7 days. Conclusions: The antibodies detection against SARS-CoV-2 offers vital clinical information for physicians, and could be used as an effective supplementary indicator for suspected cases of negative viral nucleic acid detection or in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in the diagnosis of suspected cases.","Gao, Y.; Yuan, Y.; Li, T.

760,Estimation of protection for COVID-19 in children from epidemiological information and estimate effect of policy in Japan,"Background: Incidence in children was much less than in adults during the COVID-19 outbreak. Sports and entertainment events were canceled (VEC) in Japan for two weeks during 26 February - 13 March. Most schools were closed (SC). Object: We construct a susceptible-infected -recovered model using three age classes and estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and protection level among children simultaneously. Then we simulate SC and VEC effects. Method: We used data of patients with symptoms in Japan during 14 January to assess SC and VEC introduction. Effects of SC and VEC were incorporated into the model through change in the contact pattern or frequencies among age classes. Results: Results suggest R0 as 2.86 [95%CI of 2.73, 2.97]. The protection level was estimated as 0.4 [0.2, 0.7]. SC and VEC can reduce the total number of patients significantly, by 6-7%. Discussion and Conclusion: The estimated R0 was similar to that found from other studies in China and Japan. We found a significant protection level among children, and by effects of SC and VEC.

Here we use simple stochastic simulations to evaluate different approaches taken to tackle the crisis, along with the efficiency they will hold and the number of casualties they may incur. It is clear that the less strict the social distancing the more time it will take for life to return to normal, and the more lives will be at risk. This is shown through simulations formed by an open sourced code, which allows evaluation of the outcomes from different intervention scenarios or conditions.","Bendtsen Cano, O.; Cano Morales, S.; Bendtsen, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046870v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046870v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
762,Scaling analysis of COVID-19 spreading based on Belgian hospitalization data,"We analyze the temporal evolution of accumulated hospitalization cases due to COVID-19 in Belgium. The increase of hospitalization cases is consistent with an initial exponential phase, and a subsequent power law growth. For the latter, we estimate a power law exponent of {approx} 2.2, which is consistent with growth kinetics of COVID-19 in China and indicative of the underlying small world network structure of the epidemic. Finally, we fit an SIR-X model to the experimental data and estimate the effect of containment policies in comparison to their effect in China. This model suggests that the base reproduction rate has been significantly reduced, but that the number of susceptible individuals that is isolated from infection is very small. Based on the SIR-X model fit, we analyze the COVID-19 mortality and the number of patients requiring ICU treatment over time.","Smeets, B.; Watte, R.; Ramon, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046730v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20046730v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

It is of great significance to study the law of cross-regional spread of the epidemic, for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 in the future in China and other countries or regions. In this study, the cross-regional connection intensity between cities was characterized based on the probability and the effective distance of the shortest path tree, and the empirical analysis was carried out based on the high-frequency data such as the cases of COVID 19 outbreaks. It is concluded that the higher the intensity of inter-city connection, the larger scale the cross-regional spread of the epidemic.","Lin, S.; Qiao, Y.; Huang, J.; Yan, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20044958v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20044958v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
764,A model to estimate regional demand for COVID-19 related hospitalizations,"COVID-19 has quickly become a global pandemic that threatens to overwhelm hospital facilities throughout the United States. In order to aid community and hospital leaders, we created an interactive, quantitative model that predicts the demand for hospitalization for patients with COVID-19 based on county-level population characteristics, data from the literature on COVID-19, and data from online repositories. Using this information as well as user inputs, the model estimates a time series of demand for intensive care beds and acute care beds as well as the availability of those beds. The model, available online, is designed to be intuitive and interactive so that local leaders with limited technical or epidemiological expertise may make decisions based on a variety of scenarios. This complements high-level models designed for public consumption and technically sophisticated models designed for use by epidemiologists. The model is actively being used by several academic medical centers and policy makers, and we believe that further access will continue to aid community and hospital leaders in their response to COVID-19.","Ferstad, J.

765,Role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19 Infection- A Systematic Literature Review,"Background: Coronavirus pandemic is currently a global public health emergency. At present, no pharmacological treatment is known to treat this condition, and there is a need to review the available treatments. Objective: While there have been studies to describe the role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in various viral conditions, there is limited information about the use of them in COVID-19. This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence regarding the role of chloroquine in treating coronavirus infection. Methods: The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this review. A literature search was performed using PUBMED & Google Scholar to find articles about the role of CQ in COVID-19 patients. Results: We included 19 publications (Five published articles, three letters/correspondence, one commentary, five pre-proofs of accepted articles, one abstract of yet to be published article, and four were pre-prints (not yet peer-reviewed) articles) in this systematic review. All the articles mentioned about the role of chloroquine and /or hydroxychloroquine in limiting the infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19). Conclusions: There is theoretical, experimental, preclinical and clinical evidence of the effectiveness of chloroquine in patients affected with COVID-19. There is adequate evidence of drug safety from the long-time clinical use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in other indications. More data from ongoing and future trials will add more insight into the role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 infection.","Kapoor, K.

766,"What is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 upon lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city, China","Background: The Chinese government implemented a metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city on 23rd January 2020 to curb the epidemic of the coronavirus COVID-19. Lifting of this quarantine is imminent. We modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted. Method: We constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic at different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and facial mask usage on the epidemic. Results: We estimated that at the end of the epidemic, a total of 65,572 (46,156-95,264) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,144 (14,422-23,447, 24.6%) would be infected through public contacts, 45,795 (32,390-66,395, 69.7%) through household contact, 3,633 (2,344-5,865, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 783 (553-1,134) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,850 (1,801-4,981) medical staff members). A total of 3,262 (1,592-6,470) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. For an early lifting date (21st March), facial mask needed to be sustained at a relatively high rate ([&ge;]85%) if public contacts were to recover to 100% of the pre-quarantine level. In contrast, lifting the quarantine on 18th April allowed public person-to-person contact adjusted back to the pre-quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage (75%). However, a low facial mask usage (<50%) combined with an increased public contact (>100%) would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios. Lifting the quarantine on 25th April would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage. Conclusion: The prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan-wide quarantine is lifted but requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate.","Zhang, L.; Shen, M.; Ma, X.; Su, S.; Gong, W.; Wang, J.; Tao, Y.; Zou, Z.; Zhao, R.; Lau, J.; Li, W.; Liu, F.; Ye, K.; Wang, Y.; Zhuang, G.; Fairley, C.

767,Diagnostic Indexes of a Rapid IgG/IgM Combined Antibody Test for SARS-CoV-2,"[Abstract]Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 has become pandemic in the world. The need for IgG/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%, and 88.3%, respectively. Kappa efficiency between IgG/IgM test kit and RT-PCR were 0.75. 2. Accuracy in mild/common and severe/critical subgroup were 73.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Accuracy in clinical confirmed, suspected cases and other disease subgroups were 70%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. 3. Patients were further divided into 0-7, 8-15 and >= 16 groups according to the time from illness onset to sample collection. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in these three groups were 18.8%, 77.8% and 40%; 100%, 50% and 87.5%; 100%, 64.3%, and 93.9, respectively. Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of this ease-of-use IgG/IgM combined test kit were adequate, plus short turnaround time, no specific requirements for additional equipment or skilled technicians, all of these collectively contributed to its competence for mass testing. At the current stage, it cannot take the place of SARA-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR, but can be served as a complementary option for RT-PCR. The combination of RT-PCR and IgG-IgM combined test kit could provide further insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.","Liu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Diao, B.; Ren, F.; Wang, Y.; Ding, J.; Huang, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044883v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044883v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
768,Persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence is companied with defects in adaptive immune system in non-severe COVID-19 patients,"Background: COVID-19 has been widely spreading. We aim to examine adaptive immune cells in non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Methods 37 non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence transferred to Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively recruited to PP (persistently positive) group, which was further allocated to PPP group (n=19) and PPN group (n=18), according to their testing results after 7 days (N=negative). Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Data from age- and sex-matched non-severe patients at disease onset (PA [positive on admission] patients, n=37), and lymphocyte subpopulation measurements from matched 54 healthy subjects were extracted for comparison. Results Compared with PA patients, PP patients had much improved laboratory findings, including WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, albumin, AST, CRP, SAA, and IL-6. The absolute numbers of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells were significantly higher in PP group than that in PA group, and were comparable to that in healthy controls. PPP subgroup had markedly reduced B cells and T cells compared to PPN group and healthy subjects. Finally, paired results of these lymphocyte subpopulations from 10 PPN patients demonstrated that the number of T cells and B cells significantly increased when the SARS-CoV-2 tests turned negative. Conclusion Persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence in non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced numbers of adaptive immune cells. Monitoring lymphocyte subpopulations could be clinically meaningful in identifying fully recovered COVID-19 patients.

769,Climate effect on COVID-19 spread rate: an online surveillance tool,"Background: COVID-19 outbreak poses an unprecedented challenge for societies, healthcare organizations and economies. In the present analysis we coupled climate data with COVID-19 spread rates worldwide, and in a single country (USA). Methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the COVID-19 Global Cases by the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University up to March 19, 2020. We assessed disease spread by two measures: replication rate (RR), the slope of the logarithmic curve of confirmed cases, and the rate of spread (RoS), the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic curve. Results: Based on predefined criteria, the mean COVID-19 RR was significantly lower in warm climate countries (0.12{+/-} 0.02) compared with cold countries (0.24{+/-} 0.01), (P<0.0001). Similarly, RoS was significantly lower in warm climate countries 0.12{+/-} 0.02 vs. 0.25{+/-} 0.01 than in cold climate countries (P<0.001). In all countries (independent of climate classification) both RR and RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation with temperature R= -0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001 and R= -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001, respectively. We identified a similar moderate negative correlation with the dew point temperature. Additional climate variables did not display a significant correlation with neither RR nor RoS. Finally, in an ancillary analysis, COVID-19 intra-country model using an inter-state analysis of the USA did not identify yet correlation between climate parameters and RR or RoS as of March, 19, 2020. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a plausible negative correlation between warmer climate and COVID-19 spread rate as defined by RR and RoS worldwide. This initial correlation should be interpreted cautiously and be further validated over time, the pandemic is at different stages in various countries as well as in regions within these countries. As such, some associations may be more affected by local transmission patterns rather than by climate.

770,Prevalence and Factors Associated with Depression and Anxiety of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,"Objective: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic has raised international concern. Mental health is becoming an issue that cannot be ignored in our fight against it. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively. The bivariate correlations showed that less social support was correlated with more anxious (r=-0.196, p<0.05) and depressive (r=-0.360p<0.05) symptoms among patients with COVID-19. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender ({beta}=1.446, p=0.034), age ({beta}=0.074, p=0.003), oxygen saturation ({beta} =-2.140, p=0.049), and social support ({beta} =-1.545, p=0.017) were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, age ({beta}=0.084, p=0.001), family infection with SARS-CoV-2 ({beta} =1.515, p=0.027) and social support ({beta} =-2.236, p<0.001) were the factors associated with depression.

771,COVID-19: Projecting the impact in Rohingya refugee camps and beyond,"Background: COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences among refugees living in camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site. Projections of the potential COVID-19 infection burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical to inform preparedness planning. Methods: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic disease transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the number and daily rate of infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected under each scenario. Findings: A large-scale outbreak is highly likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp across scenarios with 65-95% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 infections. Estimated infections range from 119-504 between low and high transmission scenarios in the first 30 days; and between 424,798 and 543,647 in 12 months. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 58-139 days between the low and high transmission scenarios. Estimated deaths range from 1,647-2,109 between low and high transmission scenarios. Interpretation: A COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring unrealistically large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems. As global resources to fight this pandemic become scarce, displaced persons must not be forgotten.","Truelove, S. A.; Abrahim, O.; Altare, C.; Azman, A.; Spiegel, P.

773,A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission between frontliners and the general public,"The number of COVID-19 cases is continuously increasing in different countries (as of March 2020) including the Philippines. It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.","Buhat, C. A.

774,"Triage assessment of cardiorespiratory risk status based on measurement of the anaerobic threshold, and estimation by patient-reported activity limitation","BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and patient-specific variables. RESULTS: In the 26 patients (aged 21-77, median 57 years), anaerobic threshold ranged from 7.6-24.5 (median 12.35) ml.min-1kg-1 and placed more than half of the patients (15, 57.7%) in the >11 ml.min-1kg-1 category suggested as lower-risk for intra-abdominal surgeries. Neither age nor baseline SpO2 predicted anaerobic threshold, or lower/higher risk categories, either alone or in multivariate analyses, despite baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 79 to 99 (median 92)%, haemoglobin from 108 to 183 (median 156)g.L-1. However, lower haemoglobin, and particularly, arterial oxygen content and oxygen pulse were associated with increased cardiorespiratory risk: Modelling a haemoglobin increase of 25g.L-1 placed a further 7/26 (26.9%) patients in a lower risk category. For patients completing the VSAQ, derived metabolic equivalents were strongly associated with anaerobic threshold enabling risk evaluations through a simple questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline exercise tolerance may override age and diagnostic labels in triage settings. These data support approaches to risk reduction by aerobic conditioning and attention to anaemia. The VSAQ is suggested as a rapid screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk assessment to implement during triage/screening.","Thurairatnam, S.; Gawecki, F.; Strangeways, T.; Perks, J.; Santhirapala, V.; Myers, J.; Tighe, H.

775,Modeling the Epidemic Dynamics of COVID-19 Outbreak in Iran,"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the global health and world's economy have been profound and unseen since the Spanish flu of 1918-19. As of now, many countries have been severely affected, partly because of slow responses to the crisis, ill-preparedness of their health system, and the fragile health infrastructure and the shortage of protective equipment. This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic. Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers. The results confirm that in such circumstances, social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to implement, but it could also prove extremely costly and damaging to the economy. An alternative policy, this note argues, is to couple effective social distancing with extensive testing, even to those who are asymptomatic, and isolate the identified cases actively. Otherwise, many lives will be lost, and the health system will collapse, adding to the ongoing economic troubles that many countries have started to encounter.","Einian, M.; Tabarraei, H.

776,The time-series ages distribution of the reported COVID-2019 infected people suggests the undetected local spreading of COVID-2019 in Hubei and Guangdong provinces before 19th Jan 2020,"COVID-2019 is broken out in China. It becomes a severe public health disaster in one month. Find the period in which the spreading of COVID-2019 was overlooked, and understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-2019 in the period will provide valuable information for the countries facing the threats of COVID-2019. The most extensive epidemiological analysis of COVID-2019 shows that older people have lower infection rates compared to middle-aged persons. Common sense is that older people prefer to report their illness and get treatment from the hospital compared to middle-aged persons. We propose a hypothesis that when the spreading of COVID-2019 was overlooked, we will find more older cases than the middle-aged cases. At first, we tested the hypothesis with 4597 COVID-2019 infected samples reported from 26th Nov 2019 to 17th Feb 2020 across the mainland of China. We found that 19th Jan 2020 is a critical time point. Few samples were reported before that day, and most of them were older ones. Then samples were explosively increased after that day, and many of them were middle-aged people. We have demonstrated the hypothesis to this step. Then, we grouped samples by their residences(provinces). We found that, in the provinces of Hubei and Guangdong, the ages of samples reported before 19th Jan 2020 are significantly higher than the ages of samples reported after that day. It suggests the COVID-2019 may be spreading in Hubei and Guangdong provinces before 19th Jan 2020 while people were unconscious of it. At last, we proposed that the ages distribution of each-day-reported samples could serve as a warning indicator of whether all potential COVID-2019 infected people are found. We think the power of our analysis is limit because 1. the work is data-driven, and 2. only ~5% of the COVID-2019 infected people in China are included in the study. However, we believe it still shows some value for its ability to estimate the possible unfound COVID-2019 infected people.","WU, C.; zheng, m.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20040204v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20040204v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

Whereas oral swabs or sputum from the lower respiratory tract were tested RT-PCR positive in all patients, RNAemia was neither detected in 3 patients without symptoms nor in 14 patients with flu-like symptoms, fever or pneumonia. The only patient with RNAemia suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was artificially ventilated in an intensive care unit. Risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood components in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals therefore seems negligible but further studies are needed.","Corman, V. M.; Rabenau, H.

The corresponding mathematical models must be simple enough, since their parameters are unknown and have to be estimated using limited statistical data sets. The SIR model, statistical approach to the parameter identification and the official WHO daily data about the confirmed cumulative number of cases were used to calculate the SIR curves and make some estimations and predictions.

779,First month of the epidemic caused by COVID-19 in Italy: current status and real-time outbreak development forecast,"Background: The first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (42%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (31%), recovered or discharged (13%), deceased (10%), and hospitalized in intensive care (4%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 115,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months. Conclusions: Once month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.","Megna, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044628v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044628v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
780,"SARS-CoV-2 detection using digital PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment monitoring and criteria for discharge","Background: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by RT-PCR is one of the criteria approved by China FDA for diagnosis of COVID-19. However, inaccurate test results (for example, high false negative rate and some false positive rate) were reported in both China and US CDC using the RT-PCR method. Inaccurate results are caused by inadequate detection sensitivity of RT-PCR, low viral load in some patients, difficulty to collect samples from COVID-19 patients, insufficient sample loading during RT-PCR tests, and RNA degradation during sample handling process. False negative detection could subject patients to multiple tests before diagnosis can be made, which burdens health care system. Delayed diagnosis could cause infected patients to miss the best treatment time window. False negative detection could also lead to prematurely releasing infected patients who still carry residual SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this case, these patients could infect many others. A high sensitivity RNA detection method to resolve the existing issues of RT-PCR is in need for more accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: Digital PCR (dPCR) instrument DropX-2000 and assay kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 108 clinical specimens from 36 patients including pharyngeal swab, stool and blood from different days during hospitalization. Double-blinded experiment data of 108 clinical specimens by dPCR methods were compared with results from officially approved RT-PCR assay. A total of 109 samples including 108 clinical specimens and 1 negative control sample were tested in this study. All of 109 samples, 26 were from 21patients reported as positive by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection in local CDC and then hospitalized in Nantong Third Hospital. Among the 109 samples, dPCR detected 30 positive samples on ORFA1ab gene, 47 samples with N gene positive, and 30 samples with double positive on ORFA1ab and N genes. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimize dPCR is at least 10-fold lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of dPCR for clinical detection is 96.3%. 4 out 4 of (100 %) negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were positive judged by dPCR based on the follow-up investigation. 2 of 2 samples in the RT-PCR grey area (Ct value > 37) were confirmed by dPCR with positive results. 1 patient being tested positive by RT-PCR was confirmed to be negative by dPCR. The dPCR results show clear viral loading decrease in 12 patients as treatment proceed, which can be a useful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment. Conclusions: Digital PCR shows improved lower limit of detection, sensitivity and accuracy, enabling COVID-19 detection with less false negative and false positive results comparing with RT-PCR, especially for the tests with low viral load specimens. We showed evidences that dPCR is powerful in detecting asymptomatic patients and suspected patients. Digital PCR is capable of checking the negative results caused by insufficient sample loading by quantifying internal reference gene from human RNA in the PCR reactions. Multi-channel fluorescence dPCR system (FAM/HEX/CY5/ROX) is able to detect more target genes in a single multiplex assay, providing quantitative count of viral load in specimens, which is a powerful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment.","Lu, R.; Wang, J.; Li, M.; Wang, Y.; Dong, J.; Cai, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042689v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042689v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

The number of cases dramatically increased beginning in early March 2020. Aim: We assessed the cumulative change in the incidence and case-fatality rates of COVID-19 at the global, regional, and national levels from January to March 16, 2020, in 154 affected countries and territories globally. Methods: We collected data of COVID-19 cases using the GitHub repository, which provided real-time surveillance information developed by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), Johns Hopkins University (USA). Information such as confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries reported across all affected countries was collected from January 22 to March 16, 2020. We estimated the change in the incidence rate, case-fatality rate, and recovery rate from January 22 to February 29 and from March 1 to March 16, 2020. Results: From January 22 to March 16, 2020, globally, the number of incident COVID-19 cases increased by 276.2%, and Europe recorded 65,281 new cases from March 1 to 16, 2020. Overall, the case-fatality rate was 3.92%, with a high COVID-19 fatality rate in Italy (7.7%), Iran (5.7%), China (4.2%) and the United Kingdom (3.6%). The estimated percentage change in COVID-19 cases from March 1 to 16, 2020, was highest in Belgium (105.8/100,000 population), followed by Qatar (439/100,000 population) and Portugal (331/100,000 population). The overall recovery rate of COVID-19 was 43%; China (35.5%) had the highest recovery rate, while the United States of America recorded a recovery rate of 0.3%. Conclusion: Overall, all the COVID-19-affected countries showed an upward trend in incidence, with little change in the incidence rate of -0.20% from January to Mid-March. The case-fatality rate was found to be 3.92%, and the recovery rate was observed to be less than half (43%) among COVID-19 patients.

782,Highly pathogenic coronavirus N protein aggravates lung injury by MASP-2-mediated complement over-activation,"An excessive immune response contributes to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and lethality, but the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the N proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were found to bind to MASP-2, the key serine protease in the lectin pathway of complement activation, resulting in aberrant complement activation and aggravated inflammatory lung injury. Either blocking the N protein:MASP-2 interaction or suppressing complement activation can significantly alleviate N protein-induced complement hyper-activation and lung injury in vitro and in vivo. Complement hyper-activation was also observed in COVID-19 patients, and a promising suppressive effect was observed when the deteriorating patients were treated with anti-C5a monoclonal antibody. Complement suppression may represent a common therapeutic approach for pneumonia induced by these highly pathogenic coronaviruses.","Gao, T.; Hu, M.; Zhang, X.; Li, H.; Zhu, L.; Liu, H.; Dong, Q.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, Z.; Hu, Y.; Fu, Y.; Jin, Y.; Li, K.; Zhao, S.; Xiao, Y.; Luo, S.; Li, L.; Zhao, L.; Liu, J.; Zhao, H.; Liu, Y.; Yang, W.; Peng, J.; Chen, X.; Li, P.; Liu, Y.; Xie, Y.; Song, J.; Zhang, L.; Ma, Q.; Bian, X.; Chen, W.; Liu, X.; Mao, Q.; Cao, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20041962v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.20041962v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

A total of 66 upper respiratory swabs, 51 feces, 56 urine and 56 plasma samples were sequentially collected from 23 patients in a designated hospital. The plasma and urine samples were all negative, except for urine samples from two severe cases at the latest available detection point. Conversely, virus was shed in respiratory swabs and feces samples during the diseased period. Ten of 12 (83.3%) cases were positive for feces samples, while 14 of 21 (66.7%) were positive for respiratory samples. In addition, the median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in the upper respiratory swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces. Notably, at 26 days after discharge, case 3 (a 45-year-old) was detected positive again in the feces samples, but appears to be healthy and negative for respiratory swabs.

784,The comparative superiority of IgM-IgG antibody test to real-time reverse transcriptase PCR detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis,"Background: As the increasing number of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused an outbreak initiated from Wuhan, China in December, 2019, the clinical features and treatment of COVID-19 patients have been understood. However, it is urgent to need the rapid and accurate detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the antibodies-based and nucleic acid-based tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Method: We retrospectively and observationally studied 133 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from Feb 17 to Mar 1, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between IgM-IgG antibody test and real-time RT-PCR detection for COVID-19 patients. Results: Of 133 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 44 moderate cases, 52 severe cases, and 37 critical cases with no significant difference of gender and age among three subgroups. Overall, the positive ratio in IgM antibody test was higher than in RT-PCR detection. In RT-PCR detection, the positive ratio was 65.91%, 71.15%, and 67.57% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Whereas, the positive ratio of IgM/IgG antibody detection in patients was 79.55%/93.18%, 82.69%/100%, and 72.97%/97.30% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Moreover, the concentrations of antibodies were also measured in three subgroups.

However, evidence regarding its effects in patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Main methods: From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ. Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group. Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 31) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 31). Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group. However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group. Significance: Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ could significantly shorten TTCR and promote the absorption of pneumonia.","Chen, Z.; Hu, J.; Zhang, Z.; Shan Jiang, S.; Han, S.; Yan, D.; Zhuang, R.; Hu, B.; Zhang, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
786,Why estimating population-based case fatality rates during epidemics may be misleading,"Different ways of calculating mortality ratios during epidemics can yield widely different results, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual- and population-based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the length of time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided by the total number of infected cases to date. Using available data on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and simple assumptions, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose a more systematic method to determine mortality ratios during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and errors in the data.","Böttcher, L.; Xia, M.; Chou, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044693v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044693v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
787,"Short-term forecasts and long-term mitigation evaluations for the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province, China","As an emerging infectious disease, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has developed into a global pandemic. During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.","Yang, Q.; Yi, C.; Vajdi, A.; Cohnstaedt, L.

Methods: COVID-19 patients transferred from the first emergency ward of Taiyuan fourth people's Hospital from February 8 to March 3, 2020 were selected. The information of general conditions, clinical manifestations, laboratory indexes, nucleic acid detection and treatment were collected. The changes of blood phosphorus level and absolute value of lymphocytes in ordinary and severe/critical patients were recorded and compared. Results: A total of 32 patients with COVID-19 were collected, including 12 cases of common type and 20 cases of severe/critical type. Before treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups were significantly lower than the normal level, and the serum phosphorus levels of the severe/critical patients were lower than those of the common type patients (t = 2.767, P < 0.010). After treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups reached normal, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (t = 0.231, P > 0.819). The level of lymphocytes in severe/critical patients was lower than that in normal patients (t = 4.636, P < 0.001) before treatment.

We analysed SARS-Cov-2 infected cases from Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and noted divergent characteristics of these Tibetans infected cases compared to Han Chinese, characterizing by a considerable proportion of asymptomatic carriers (21.7%), and few symptomatic patients with initial symptom of fever (7.7%). Here, we did a descriptive study on clinical characteristics of 18 asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median age of these asymptomatic carriers was 31 years and one third of them were students, aged under 20 years. Notably, some of asymptomatic carriers had recognizable changes in radiological and laboratory indexes. Our finding indicates a potentially big number of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic carriers in prevalent area, highlighting a necessity of screening individuals with close contact of infected patients, for a better control on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Song, H.; Xiao, J.; Qiu, J.; Yin, J.; Yang, H.; Shi, R.; Zhang, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043836v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043836v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
790,"A Multi-hospital Study in Wuhan, China：Protective Effects of Non-menopause and Female Hormones on SARS-CoV-2 infection","Objective To determine the correlation between menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis of COVID-19, and to identify potential protective factors for female patients. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized at Tongji and Mobile Cabin Hospitals from Jan 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Sex differences in severity and composite endpoints (admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death) of COVID-19 patients were compared. The correlation analysis and cox/logistic regression modeling of menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis were conducted. Correlation between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and disease severity or estradiol (E2) was revealed.Results Chi square test indicated significant differences in distribution of composite endpoints (p<0.01) and disease severity (p=0.05) between male and female patients (n=1902). 435 female COVID-19 patients with menstruation records were recruited. By the end of Mar 8, 111 patients recovered and discharged (25.3%). Multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for age and severity indicated that post-menopausal patients show the greater risk of hospitalization time than non-menopausal patients (relative hazard [RH], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.46)Logistic regression model showed that higher AMH as a control for age increases the risk of severity of COVID-19 (HR=0.146, 95%CI= (0.026-0.824) p=0.029). E2 showed protective effect against disease severity (HR=0.335, 95%CI= (0.105-1.070), p=0.046).In the Mann-Whitney U test, the higher levels of IL6 and IL8 were found in severe group (p=0.040, 0.033).The higher levels of IL2R, IL6, IL8 and IL10 were also observed in patients with composite end points(p<0.001,<0.001, =0.009, = 0.040).E2 levels were negatively correlated with IL2R, IL6, IL8 and TNF in luteal phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p=0.033, 0.048, 0.054, 0.023) and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.651; p=0.030). Conclusions and Relevance Menopause is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. E2 and AMH are negatively correlated with COVID-19 severity probably due to their regulation of cytokines related to immunity and inflammation.","Ding, T.; Zhang, J.; Wang, T.; Cui, P.; Chen, Z.; Jiang, J.; Zhou, S.; Dai, J.; Wang, B.; Yuan, S.; Ma, W.; Ma, L.; Rong, Y.; Chang, J.; Miao, X.; Ma, X.; Wang, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20043943v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20043943v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

792,Evaluation of Group Testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested individuals from 1.8M to 3.6M using only 672k more tests. This strategy is well-suited to supplement testing for asymptomatic and mild cases who would otherwise go untested, and enable them to adopt behavioral changes to slow the spread of COVID-19.","Sinnott-Armstrong, N.; Klein, D.; Hickey, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043968v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043968v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
793,"Machine Learning Approach for Confirmation of COVID-19 Cases: Positive, Negative, Death and Release","In recent days, Covid-19 coronavirus has been an immense impact on social, economic fields in the world. The objective of this study determines if it is feasible to use machine learning method to evaluate how much prediction results are close to original data related to Confirmed-Negative-Released-Death cases of Covid-19. For this purpose, a verification method is proposed in this paper that uses the concept of Deep-learning Neural Network. In this framework, Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are also assimilated finally for training the dataset and the prediction results are tally with the results predicted by clinical doctors. The prediction results are validated against the original data based on some predefined metric. The experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is useful in generating suitable results based on the critical disease outbreak. It also helps doctors to recheck further verification of virus by the proposed method. The outbreak of Coronavirus has the nature of exponential growth and so it is difficult to control with limited clinical persons for handling a huge number of patients with in a reasonable time. So it is necessary to build an automated model, based on machine learning approach, for corrective measure after the decision of clinical doctors. It could be a promising supplementary confirmation method for frontline clinical doctors. The proposed method has a high prediction rate and works fast for probable accurate identification of the disease. The performance analysis shows that a high rate of accuracy is obtained by the proposed method.","Bandyopadhyay, S.

794,Clinical characteristics of the recovered COVID-19 patients with re-detectable positive RNA test,"Background It has been reported that several cases recovered from COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after discharge (re-detectable positive, RP), however the clinical characteristics, significance and potential cause of RP patients remained elusive. Methods A total of 262 COVID-19 patients were discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020, and were enrolled for analysis of their clinical parameters. The RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to the disease severity during their hospitalization period. The clinical characterization at re-admission to the hospital was analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were detected using high-sensitive detection methods. Findings Up to March 10, 2020, all of patients were followed up for at least 14 days, and 38/262 of RP patients (14.5%) were present. The RP patients were characterized by being less than 14-years old and having mild and moderate conditions as compared to NRP patients, while no severe patients became RP. Retrospectively, the RP patients displayed fewer symptoms, more sustained remission of CT imaging and earlier RNA negative-conversion but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization period as compared to those NRP patients. When re-admitted to the hospital, these RP patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms or disease progression indicated by normal or improving CT imaging and inflammatory cytokine levels. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and no suspicious clinical symptoms were reported. However, 18/24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested to be positive for virus RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting the carrier status of virus possibly existed in patients recovered from COVID-19. Interpretation Our results showed that young and mild COVID-19 patients seem to be RP patients after discharge, who show no obviously clinical symptoms and disease progression upon re-admission. More sensitive RNA detection methods are required to monitor these patients during follow-up. Our findings provide empirical information and evidence for the effective management of COVID-19 patients during their convalescent phase.","An, J.; Liao, X.; Xiao, T.; Qian, S.; Yuan, J.; Ye, H.; Qi, F.; Shen, C.; Liu, Y.; Wang, L.; Cheng, X.; Li, N.; Cai, Q.; Wang, F.; Chen, J.; Liu, Y.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, F.; Fu, Y.; Tan, X.; Liu, L.; Zhang, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044222v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044222v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
795,Risk assessment of progression to severe conditions for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a single-center retrospective study,"Background: Management of high mortality risk due to significant progression requires prior assessment of time-to-progression. However, few related methods are available for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 338 adult patients admitted to one hospital between Jan 11, 2020 to Feb 29, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 8, 2020. We compared characteristics between patients with severe and non-severe outcome, and used multivariate survival analyses to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions. Results: A total of 76 (31.9%) patients progressed to severe conditions and 3 (0.9%) died. The mean time from hospital admission to severity onset is 3.7 days. Age, body mass index (BMI), fever symptom on admission, co-existing hypertension or diabetes are associated with severe progression. Compared to non-severe group, the severe group already demonstrated, at an early stage, abnormalities in biomarkers indicating organ function, inflammatory responses, blood oxygen and coagulation function. The cohort is characterized with increasing cumulative incidences of severe progression up to 10 days after admission. Competing risks survival model incorporating CT imaging and baseline information showed an improved performance for predicting severity onset (mean time-dependent AUC = 0.880). Conclusions: Multiple predisposition factors can be utilized to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions at an early stage. Multivariate survival models can reasonably analyze the progression risk based on early-stage CT images that would otherwise be misjudged by artificial analysis.","Zeng, L.; Li, J.; Liao, M.; Hua, R.; Huang, P.; Zhang, M.; Zhang, Y.; Shi, Q.; Xia, Z.; Ning, X.; Liu, D.; Mo, J.; Zhou, Z.; Li, Z.; Fu, Y.; Liao, Y.; Yuan, J.; Wang, L.; He, Q.; Liu, L.; Qiao, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043166v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043166v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
796,"General Model for COVID-19 Spreading with Consideration of Intercity Migration, Insufficient Testing and Active Intervention: Application to Study of Pandemic Progression in Japan and USA","A new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Confirmed-Removed (SEICR) model with consideration of intercity travel and active intervention is proposed for predicting the spreading progression of the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). The model takes into account the known or reported number of infected cases being fewer than the actual number of infected individuals due to insufficient testing. The model integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. The data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the USA (February 20 to March 20, 2020) are used to illustrate the prediction of the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA. By fitting the model with the data, we reveal that, as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the USA could be twenty-fold and five-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting. Results show that without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the USA will see about 6.55% and 18.2% of the population eventually infected, and with drastic ten-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the USA. Finally, an assessment of the relative effectiveness of active intervention and personal protective measures is discussed. With a highly vigilant public maintaining personal hygiene and exercising strict protective measures, the percentage of population infected can be further reduced to 0.23% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA.","Zhan, C.; Tse, C.

Here we investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California using samples from returning travelers, cruise ship passengers, and cases of community transmission with unclear infection sources. Virus genomes were sampled from 29 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from Feb 3rd through Mar 15th. Phylogenetic analyses revealed at least 8 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting multiple independent introductions of the virus into the state. Virus genomes from passengers on two consecutive excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship clustered with those from an established epidemic in Washington State, including the WA1 genome representing the first reported case in the United States on January 19th. We also detected evidence for presumptive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from one community to another. These findings suggest that cryptic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California to date is characterized by multiple transmission chains that originate via distinct introductions from international and interstate travel, rather than widespread community transmission of a single predominant lineage. Rapid testing and contact tracing, social distancing, and travel restrictions are measures that will help to slow SARS-CoV-2 spread in California and other regions of the USA.","Deng, X.; Gu, W.; Federman, S.; Du Plessis, L.; Pybus, O.; Faria, N.; Wang, C.; Yu, G.; Pan, C.-Y.; Guevara, H.; Sotomayor-Gonzalez, A.; Zorn, K.; Gopez, A.; Servellita, V.; Hsu, E.; Miller, S.; Bedford, T.; Greninger, A.; Roychoudhury, P.; Famulare, M.; Chu, H.

799,Comparative Genomic Analysis of Rapidly Evolving SARS CoV-2 Viruses Reveal Mosaic Pattern of Phylogeographical Distribution,"The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19) that started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has spread worldwide emerging as a global pandemic. The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 14,500 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. Development of universal vaccines against the novel SARS-CoV-2 holds utmost urgency to control COVID19 pandemic that appears to be more severe than any of the previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS). However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, the underlying severity hidden in the SARS-CoV2 genomes is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 strains of SARS-CoV-2 reported from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 across the globe. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighbouring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16 (present in ORF1b polyprotein region) and S-Protein within 10 viral isolates from USA. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication and processing, indicating highly evolved strains of the novel SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the population of USA than in other countries. Furthermore, we found an isolate from USA (MT188341) to carry frameshift mutation between positions 2540 and 2570 of nsp16 which functions as mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase). Thus, we reason that the replicative machinery of the novel SARS-CoV-2 is fast evolving to evade host challenges and survival. These mutations are needed to be considered, otherwise it will be difficult to develop effective treatment strategies. The two proteins also had dN/dS values approaching 1-ORF1ab polyprotein (dN/dS= 0.996, 0.575) and S protein (dN/dS= 0.88) and might confer selective advantage to the virus. Through the construction of SARS-CoV-2-human interactome, we further reveal multiple host proteins (PHB, PPP1CA, TGF-beta, JACK1, JACK2, SOCS3,STAT3, JAK1-2, SMAD3, BCL2, CAV1 & SPECC1) which are manipulated by the virus proteins (nsp2, PL-PRO, N-protein, ORF7a, M-S-ORF3a complex, nsp7-nsp8-nsp9-RdRp complex) for mediating host immune mechanism for its survival.","Kumar, R.; Verma, H.; Singhvi, N.; Sood, U.; Gupta, V.; Singh, M.; Sharma, R.; Hira, P.; Nagar, S.; Talwar, C.; Nayyar, N.; Anand, S.; Rawat, C.

The wildly varying predictions make it difficult to base policy decisions on. On the other hand much empirical information is already contained in data of evolving epidemiological profiles. We offer an additional tool, based on general theoretical principles and validated with data, for tracking the turning points, peak and accumulated case numbers of infected and recovered for an epidemic, and to predict its course. Ability to predict the turning points and the end of epidemic is of crucial importance for fighting the epidemic and planning for a return to normalcy. The accuracy of the prediction of the peaks of the epidemic is validated using data in different regions in China showing the effects of different levels of quarantine. The validated tool can be applied to other countries where Covid-19 has spread, and generally to future epidemics. US is found to have the largest net infection rate, and is predicted to have the largest total infected cases (708K) and will take two weeks longer than Wuhan to reach its turning point, and one week longer than Italy and Germany.","Huang, N.

Here we report the establishment and screening of genome-wide RNAi library and CRISPR library for the model megabat, Pteropus Alecto. We used the complementary RNAi and CRISPR libraries to interrogate Pteropus Alecto cells for infection with two different viruses, mumps virus and Influenza A virus, respectively. Screening results converged on the endocytosis pathway and the protein secretory pathway as required for both viral infections. Additionally, we revealed a general dependence of the C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase gene, MTHFD1, for viral replication in bat cells as well as in human cells. MTHFD1 inhibitor carolacton potently blocked replication of several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

However, the absorption of cotton swab for RNA lysates may lead to a low concentration of detectable RNA, which might be one of the main reasons for the unstable positive detecting rate. We designed and manufactured a kind of silicone swab with concave-convex structure, and further compared the effects of silicone and cotton swab on RNA extraction. Principal component analysis and Paired Wilcoxcon test suggested that a higher RNA concentration and A260/A280 would be obtained using silicone swab. The results indicated that our silicone swab had a more excellent ability to sample than the cotton swab, characterized by the higher quantity and quality of extracted RNA. Thus, we advised that the current cotton swabs need to be improved urgently in COVID-19 diagnoses and the process of ""sample collection"" and ""sample pre-processing"" must be standardized and emphasized.

803,"Forecasting COVID-19 impact on hospital bed-days, ICU-days, ventilator-days and deaths by US state in the next 4 months","Key Points Question: Assuming social distancing measures are maintained, what are the forecasted gaps in available health service resources and number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic for each state in the United States? Findings: Using a statistical model, we predict excess demand will be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. Peak ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674) ventilators. Peak demand will be in the second week of April. We estimate 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths in the United States from COVID-19 over the next 4 months. Meaning: Even with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially. Alongside the implementation and enforcement of social distancing measures, there is an urgent need to develop and implement plans to reduce non-COVID-19 demand for and temporarily increase capacity of health facilities. Abstract Importance: This study presents the first set of estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US. Objective: To determine the extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months. Exposure(s): COVID-19. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use. Results: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will a total of 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6. Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. These are urgently needed given that peak volumes are estimated to be only three weeks away. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures in all states that have not done so already within the next week and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.","IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting team,; Murray, C.

804,"Crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 9, Nsp9","Many of the proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 have related counterparts across the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) family. One such protein is non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), which is thought to mediate both viral replication and virulence. Current understanding suggests that Nsp9 is involved in viral genomic RNA reproduction. Nsp9 is thought to bind RNA via a fold that is unique to this class of betacoronoaviruses although the molecular basis for this remains ill-defined. We sought to better characterise the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo-form and, unexpectedly, in a peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer interface and impacted on the relative juxtaposition of the monomers within the homodimer. Together we have established a protocol for the production of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, determined its structure and identified a peptide-binding site that may warrant further study from the perspective of understanding Nsp9 function.","Littler, D.; Gully, B.; Colson, R.

The recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, highlights such threats to human health, social stability and global trade and economy. We used species distribution modelling and environmental data from satellite imagery to model Blueprint Priority Diseases occurrences. We constructed classical regression and Support Vector Machine models based on environmental predictor variables such as landscape, tree cover loss, climatic covariates. Models were evaluated and a weighed mean was used to map the predictive risk of disease emergence. We mapped the predictive risk for filovirus, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and coronavirus diseases. Elevation, tree cover loss and climatic covariates were found to significant factors influencing disease emergence. We also showed the relevance of disease biogeography and in the identification potential hotspots for Disease X in regions in Uganda and China.","Jagadesh, S.; Combe, M.; Nacher, M.; Gozlan, R.

808,Clinical and Paraclinical Characteristics of COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: Recently, a new strain of coronaviruses, which originated from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China has been identified. According to the high prevalence of new coronavirus, further investigation on the clinical and paraclinical features of this disease seems essential. Hence, we carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to figure out the unknown features. Methods: This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers which reported clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19. We used STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis. Results: In the present meta-analysis, 32 papers including 49504 COVID-19 patients were studied. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (84%), cough (65%) and fatigue (42%), respectively. The most common radiological and paraclinical features were bilateral pneumonia (61%), ground-glass opacity (50%), thrombocytopenia (36%) and lymphocytopenia (34%). The study also showed that the frequency of comorbidities and early symptoms was higher in critically severe patients. Moreover, we found the overall mortality rate of three percent. Conclusion: According to that there are many cases without Computed Tomography Scan findings or clear clinical symptoms, it is recommended to use other confirming methods such RNA sequencing in order to identification of suspicious undiagnosed patients. Moreover, while there is no access to clinical and paraclinical facilities in in public places such as airports and border crossings, it is recommended to consider factors such as fever, cough, sputum and fatigue.","Heydari, K.; Rismantab, S.; Shamshirian, A.; Lotfi, P.; Shadmehri, N.; Houshmand, P.; Zahedi, M.; Shamshirian, D.; Bathaeian, S.; Alizadeh-Navaei, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044057v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044057v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
809,Improved deep learning model for differentiating novel coronavirus pneumonia and influenza pneumonia,"Background: Chest CT had high sensitivity in diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) at early stage, giving it an advantage over nucleic acid detection in time of crisis. Deep learning was reported to discover intricate structures from clinical images and achieve expert-level performance in medical image analysis. To develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework on chest CT images for auto-detection of NCP, particularly focusing on differentiating NCP from influenza pneumonia (IP). Methods: 35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020. The external validation set enrolled 57 NCP patients and 50 IP patients from eight centers. Results: 96.6% of NCP lesions were larger than 1 cm and 76.8% were with intensity below -500 Hu, indicating less consolidation than IP lesions which had nodules ranging 5-10 mm. The classification schemes accurately distinguished NCP and IP lesions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.93. The Trinary scheme was more device-independent and consistent with specialists than the Plain scheme, which achieved a F1 score of 0.847, higher than the Plain scheme (0.774), specialists (0.785) and residents (0.644). Conclusions: Our study potentially provides an accurate early diagnosis tool on chest CT for NCP with high transferability, and shows high efficiency in differentiating NCP and IP, helping to reduce misdiagnosis and contain the pandemic transmission.","Zhou, M.; Chen, Y.; Wang, D.; Xu, Y.; Yao, W.; Huang, J.; Jin, X.; Pan, Z.; Tan, J.; Wang, L.; Xia, Y.; Zou, L.; Xu, X.; Wei, J.; Guan, M.; Feng, J.; Zhang, H.; Qu, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043117v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043117v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True
810,Government Responses Matter: Predicting Covid-19 cases in US under an empirical Bayesian time series framework,"Since the Covid-19 outbreak, researchers have been predicting how the epidemic will evolve, especially the number in each country, through using parametric extrapolations based on the history. In reality, the epidemic progressing in a particular country depends largely on its policy responses and interventions. Since the outbreaks in some countries are earlier than United States, the prediction of US cases can benefit from incorporating the similarity in their trajectories. We propose an empirical Bayesian time series framework to predict US cases using different countries as prior reference. The resultant forecast is based on observed US data and prior information from the reference country while accounting for different population sizes. When Italy is used as prior in the prediction, which the US data resemble the most, the cases in the US will exceed 300,000 by the beginning of April unless strong measures are adopted.","Liu, Z.; Guo, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20044578v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20044578v1?rss=1,2020-03-30,2020-03-30,,True

812,A deductive approach to modeling the spread of COVID-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), previously known as 2019-nCoV, is responsible for the atypical pneumonia pandemic designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The confirmed number of cases continues to grow exponentially reaching 492,000 people in 175 countries as of March 25, 2020. 22,169 people (~4.5%) infected with SARS-COV-2 virus have died. We have developed an exponential regression model using the COVID-19 case data (Jan 22 - Mar 22, 2020). Our primary model uses designated Phase 1 countries, who exceed 2500 cases on Mar 22. The model is then applied to Phase 2 countries: those that escaped the initial Phase 1 global expansion of COVID-19. With the exception of stabilizing countries (South Korea, Japan, and Iran) all Phase 1 countries are growing exponentially, as per I2500(t)=120.4 x e0.238t, with a rate, r = 0.238 {+/-} 0.068. Excluding China, the BRICS developing nations and Australia are in Phase 2. Case data from Phase 2 countries are following the model derived from Phase 1 countries. In the absence of measures employed to flatten the curve including social distancing, quarantine, and healthcare expansion, our model projects over 274,000 cases and 12,300 deaths in the US by Mar 31. India can expect 123,000 cases by April 16. By flattening the curve to the growth rate of stabilizing countries (r = 0.044 {+/-} 0.062), the US would prevent 8,500 deaths by Mar 31, and India would prevent 5,500 deaths by April 16.","Mishra, P.

813,Dangers of ACE inhibitor and ARB usage in COVID-19: evaluating the evidence,"Background: Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in patients with COVID-19, based on the hypothesis that such medications may raise expression of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=11) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. Results: The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses than typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Conclusion: Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19. We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.","Sriram, K.; Insel, P.

814,Trend Analysis and Forecasting of COVID-19 outbreak in India,"COVID-19 is spreading really fast around the world. The current study describes the situation of the outbreak of this disease in India and predicts the number of cases expected to rise in India. The study also discusses the regional analysis of Indian states and presents the preparedness level of India in combating this outbreak. The study uses exploratory data analysis to report the current situation and uses time-series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. The data has been considered from the repository of John Hopkins University and covers up the time period from 30th January 2020 when the first case occurred in India till the end of 24th March 2020 when the Prime Minister of India declared a complete lockdown in the country for 21 days starting 25th March 2020. The major findings show that number of infected cases in India is rising quickly with the average infected cases per day rising from 10 to 73 from the first case to the 300th case. The current mortality rate for India stands around 1.9. Kerala and Maharashtra are the top two infected states in India with more than 100 infected cases reported in each state, respectively. A total of 25 states have reported at least one infected case, however only 8 of them have reported deaths due to COVID-19. The ARIMA model prediction shows that the infected cases in India may reach up to 700 thousands in next 30 days in worst case scenario while most optimistic scenario may restrict the numbers up to 1000-1200. Also, the average forecast by ARIMA model in next 30 days is around 7000 patients from the current numbers of 536. Based on the forecasting model by Holts linear trends, an expected 3 million people may get infected if control measures are not taken in the near future. This study will be useful for the key stakeholders like Government Officials and Medical Practitioners in assessing the trends for India and preparing a combat plan with stringent measures. Also, this study will be helpful for data scientists, statisticians, mathematicians and analytics professionals in predicting outbreak numbers with better accuracy.","Gupta, R.; Pal, S.

Chinese efforts in curbing the virus have widely been recognized. Even the WHO has lauded the efforts of the Chinese government and advised the world to learn from China in fighting the disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, to curb the spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government has implemented unprecedented prevention interventions at the nationwide level. Currently, the outbreak in Wuhan is changing in a positive direction and has been effectively controlled. However, it is not clear what these measures were and how these measures changed to curb the outbreak of COVID-19 quickly.

817,Disposable N95 Masks Pass Qualitative Fit-Test But Have Decreased Filtration Efficiency after Cobalt-60 Gamma Irradiation,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals around the globe. One component of PPE that is in particular demand are disposable N95 face masks. To alleviate this, many methods of N95 mask sterilization have been studied and proposed with the hope of being able to safely reuse masks. Two major considerations must be made when re-sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters. We studied Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation as a method of effective sterilization without inducing mask degradation. Significant literature exists supporting the use of gamma radiation as a sterilization method, with viral inactivation of SARS-CoV reported at doses of at most 10 kGy, with other studies supporting 5 kGy for many types of viruses. However, concerns have been raised about the radiation damaging the fiber material within the mask, specifically by causing cross-linking of polymers, leading to cracking and degradation during fitting and/or deployment. A set of 3M 8210 and 9105 masks were irradiated using MIT's Co-60 irradiator. Three masks of each type received 0 kiloGray (kGy), 10 kGy and 50 kGy of approximately 1.3 MeV gamma radiation from the circular cobalt sources, at a dose rate of 2.2 kGy per hour. Following this sterilization procedure, the irradiated masks passed a OSHA Gerson Qualitative Fit Test QLFT 50 (saccharin apparatus) when donned correctly, performed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, in a blinded study repeated in triplicate. However, the masks' filtration of 0.3 um particles was significantly degraded, even at 10 kGy. These results suggest against gamma, and possibly all ionizing radiation, as a method of disposable N95 sterilization. Even more importantly, they argue against using the qualitative fit test alone to assess mask integrity.","Cramer, A.; Tian, E.; Yu, S. H.; Galanek, M.; Lamere, E.; Li, J.; Gupta, R.; Short, M.

819,Public events and delayed flight restrictions were the turning point of the COVID-19 mitigation policy of Israel,"Background: The impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public health challenge seem to be the most serious regarding respiratory viruses since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In the absence of effective vaccine or biomedical treatment, the basic rules of public health measures have not changed, namely public distancing. Methods: We analyzed epidemiological investigation reports during the first month of the outbreak in Israel. In addition, we present a deterministic compartment model and simulations of several scenarios emphasizing quarantine and isolation policies given their efficiency. Results: We identify an abrupt change from controlled epidemic regime to an exponential growth (R_0= 2.19) in light of the actual policy-makers decisions and public behavior in Israel. Our analysis show that before the abrupt change, the new cases trend was due to returning citizens infected abroad. The abrupt change followed a holiday in which social distancing was clearly inefficient and many public gatherings were held. We further discuss three different modeled scenarios of quarantine efficiency: high-, medium-, and low-efficiency. Conclusions: Israel early lessons show that there is no allowance to compromise with the directive of social distancing. Even before the onset of the pandemic in Israel, fine-tuned but determined early decisions were taken by policy makers to monitor flight arrivals from Covid-19 affected regions and to limit public gatherings. Our analysis show that one particular holiday has shifted the occurrence curve from controlled regime to exponential growth. Therefore, even a short lapse in public responsiveness can have a dramatic effect.","Klausner, Z.; Fattal, E.; Hirsch, E.; Shapira, S.

822,Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany,"We model the evolution of the number of individuals that are reported to be sick with COVID-19 in Germany. Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic. We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries. Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurdly large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases. Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand only. Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August. We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection.

823,Understand Research Hotspots Surrounding COVID-19 and Other Coronavirus Infections Using Topic Modeling,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in humans, which eventually results in the current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) around the world. The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eight-topic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections. Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission at present. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only accounted for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections. Conclusions: These results identified knowledge gaps in the area of COVID-19 and offered directions for future research.

824,Site-specific N-glycosylation Characterization of Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Proteins using High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry,"The global pandemic of severe acute pneumonia syndrome (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 urgently calls for prevention and intervention strategies. The densely glycosylated spike (S) protein highly exposed on the viral surface is a determinant for virus binding and invasion into host cells as well as elicitation of a protective host immune response. Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein using stepped collision energy (SCE) mass spectrometry (MS). Following digestion with two complementary proteases to cover all potential N-glycosylation sequons and integrated N-glycoproteomics analysis, we revealed the N-glycosylation profile of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins at the levels of intact N-glycopeptides and glycosites, along with the glycan composition and site-specific number of glycans. All 22 potential canonical N-glycosites were identified in S protein protomer. Of those, 18 N-glycosites were conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Nearly all glycosites were preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available in the public influenza database Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data. By comparison, insect cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein contained 38 N-glycans, which were primarily assigned to the high-mannose type N-glycans, whereas the human cell-produced protein possessed up to 140 N-glycans largely belonging to the complex type. In particular, two N-glycosites located in the structurally exposed receptor-binding domain of S protein exhibited a relatively conserved N-glycan composition in human cells. This N-glycosylation profiling and determination of differences between distinct expression systems could shed light on the infection mechanism and promote development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","Zhang, Y.; Zhao, W.; Mao, Y.; Wang, S.; Zhong, Y.; Su, T.; Gong, M.; Lu, X.; Cheng, J.; Yang, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.013276v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.013276v1?rss=1,2020-03-29,2020-03-29,,False
825,Comparative performance of four nucleic acid amplification tests for SARS-CoV-2 virus,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be screened and diagnosed through the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been rapidly developed and quickly applied to clinical testing during the pandemic. However, studies evaluating the performance of these NAAT assays are limited. We evaluated the performance of four NAATs, which were marked by the Conformite Europeenne and widely used in China during the pandemic. Results showed that the analytical sensitivity of the four assays was significantly lower than that claimed by the NAAT manufacturers. The limit of detection (LOD) of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs was 3000 copies/mL, whereas the LOD of Bioperfectus NAATs was 4000 copies/mL. The results of the consistency test using 46 samples showed that Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs could detect the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity of 100% (16 /16), whereas Bioperfectus NAAT detected the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity 81.25% (13/16). The sensitivity of Bioperfectus NAAT was lower than that of the three other NAATs; this finding was consistent with the result that Bioperfectus NAAT had a higher LOD than the three other kinds of NAATs. The four above mentioned reagents presented high specificity; however, for the detection of the samples with low virus concentration, Bioperfectus reagent had the risk of missing detection. Therefore, the LOD should be considered in the selection of SARS-CoV-2 NAATs.","Xiong, Y.; Li, Z.-Z.; Zhuang, Q.; Chao, Y.; Li, F.; Ge, Y.-Y.; Wang, Y.; Ke, P.-F.; Huang, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.010975v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.010975v1?rss=1,2020-03-29,2020-03-29,,False
826,Knowledge synthesis from 100 million biomedical documents augments the deep expression profiling of coronavirus receptors,"The COVID-19 pandemic demands assimilation of all available biomedical knowledge to decode its mechanisms of pathogenicity and transmission. Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely underappreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to type II pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells. We further identify mature small intestinal enterocytes as a possible hotspot of COVID-19 fecal-oral transmission, where an intriguing maturation-correlated transcriptional signature is shared between ACE2 and the other coronavirus receptors DPP4 (MERS-CoV) and ANPEP (-coronavirus). This study demonstrates how a holistic data science platform can leverage unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured publicly available data to accelerate the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.

828,SARS-CoV-2 and ORF3a: Non-Synonymous Mutations and Polyproline Regions,"The effect of the rapid accumulation of non-synonymous mutations on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known. To predict the impact of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions identified in ORF3a on the formation of B-cell epitopes and their role in evading the immune response, nucleotide and protein sequences of 537 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions. Mutations were correlated with changes in epitope formation. A total of 19 different non-synonymous amino acids substitutions were detected in ORF3a among 537 SARS-CoV-2 strains. G251V was the most common and identified in 9.9% (n=53) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a B-cell like epitope in ORF3a. Polyproline regions were detected in two strains (EPI_ISL_410486, France and EPI_ISL_407079, Finland) and affected epitopes formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations and detected polyproline regions in ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 could be driving the evasion of the host immune response thus favoring viral spread. Rapid mutations accumulating in ORF3a should be closely monitored throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

ImportanceAt the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic and after three months of the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the disease-causing pathogen, nucleic acid changes due to host-pathogen interactions are insightful into the evolution of this virus. In this paper, we have identified a set of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a and predicted their impact on B-cell like epitope formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a could be driving protein changes that mediate immune evasion and favoring viral spread.","Issa, E.; Merhi, G.; Panossian, B.; Salloum, T.; Tokajian, S.

829,Modeling of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Proteins by Machine Learning and Physics-Based Refinement,"Protein structures are crucial for understanding their biological activities. Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need to understand the biological behavior of the virus and provide a basis for developing effective therapies. Since the proteome of the virus was determined, some of the protein structures could be determined experimentally, and others were predicted via template-based modeling approaches. However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER. However, the predicted models vary greatly and have not yet been subjected to refinement. Here, we are reporting new predictions from our in-house structure prediction pipeline. The pipeline takes advantage of inter-residue contact predictions from trRosetta, a machine learning-based method. The predicted models were further improved by applying molecular dynamics simulation-based refinement. We also took the AlphaFold models and refined them by applying the same refinement method.

830,Correlation between universal BCG vaccination policy and reduced morbidity and mortality for COVID-19: an epidemiological study,"COVID-19 has spread to most countries in the world. Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease is different in different countries. These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality makes BCG vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.","Miller, A.; Reandelar, M.

Vaccine development is focused on the principal target of the humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons per protomer, which likely play a role in immune evasion and occluding immunogenic protein epitopes. Here, using a site-specific mass spectrometric approach, we reveal the glycan structures on a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen. This analysis enables mapping of the glycan-processing states across the trimeric viral spike.

In this study, we firstly verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased -helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the presented results have provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.","Zhu, Y.; Yu, D.; Yan, H.; Chong, H.; He, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.009233v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.009233v1?rss=1,2020-03-28,2020-03-28,,False
833,SARS-CoV-2 exhibits intra-host genomic plasticity and low-frequency polymorphic quasispecies,"In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia (Coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19) associated with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also in the design of accurate diagnostics.

We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher-frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene.

Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements, reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","Karamitros, T.; Papadopoulou, G.; Bousali, M.; Mexias, A.; Tsiodras, S.; Mentis, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.009480v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.009480v1?rss=1,2020-03-28,2020-03-28,,False

These viruses make use of a large envelope protein called spike (S) to engage host cell receptors and catalyze membrane fusion. Because of the vital role that these S proteins play, they represent a vulnerable target for the development of therapeutics to combat these highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of single-domain antibodies (VHHs) from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized coronavirus spikes. These VHHs are capable of potently neutralizing MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses. The crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs block receptor binding. We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S, and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH is capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion. These data provide a molecular basis for the neutralization of pathogenic betacoronaviruses by VHHs and suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutics during coronavirus outbreaks.","Wrapp, D.; De Vlieger, D.; Corbett, K.

We then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 739 SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported to date from the current COVID-19 outbreak, and we present a curated list of 30  SARS-related-conserved regions. We find that known RNA structured elements curated as Rfam families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions, and we predict additional conserved, stable secondary structures across the viral genome. We provide 106  SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA. We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the 5 UTR, frame-shifting element, and 3 UTR. Last, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains. These 59  SARS-CoV-2-conserved-unstructured genomic regions may be most easily targeted in primer-based diagnostic and oligonucleotide-based therapeutic strategies.","Rangan, R.; Zheludev, I.

837,The Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Abolished Pluripotency in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is raging across the world, leading to a mortality rate of 3.4%. As a potential vaccine and therapeutic target, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoVN) functions in packaging the viral genome and viral self-assembly. To investigate the biological effect of nCoVN to human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), genetically engineered iPSC overexpressing nCoVN (iPSC-nCoVN) were generated by lentiviral expression systems. Unexpectedly, the morphology and proliferation rate of iPSC were changed after nCoVN expressing for two weeks. The pluripotency markers SSEA4 and TRA-1-81 were not detectable in iPSC-nCoVN. Meanwhile, iPSC-nCoVN lost the ability for differentiation into cardiomyocytes when using a routine differentiation protocol. Our data suggested that nCoVN disrupted the pluripotent properties of iPSC and turned them into fibroblasts, which provided a new insight to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.","Lin, Z.; Gao, Q.; Fang, Q.; Mai, J.; Zhou, L.; Lin, X.; Qian, Y.; Cai, T.; Chen, Z.; Wang, P.; Lin, B.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.010694v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.010694v1?rss=1,2020-03-28,2020-03-28,,False
838,"Structure-Based Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Peptidomimetic Aldehydes as a Novel Series of Antiviral Drug Candidates Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease","SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Specific antiviral drug are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 infections. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key CoV enzyme that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, which makes it an attractive drug target. In an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting Mpro, two compounds (11a and 11b) were designed and synthesized, both of which exhibited excellent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.05 M and 0.04 M respectively. Significantly, both compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay with an EC50 value of 0.42 M and 0.33 M, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11a and 11b were determined at 1.5 [A] resolution, respectively. The crystal structures showed that 11a and 11b are covalent inhibitors, the aldehyde groups of which are bound covalently to Cys145 of Mpro. Both compounds showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low toxicity which is promising drug leads with clinical potential that merits further studies.","Dai, W.; Zhang, B.; Jiang, X.-M.; Su, H.; Li, J.; Zhao, Y.; Xie, X.; Jin, Z.; Peng, J.; Liu, F.; Li, C.; Li, Y.; Bai, F.; Wang, H.; Cheng, X.; Cen, X.; Hu, S.; Yang, X.; Wang, J.; Liu, X.; Xiao, G.; Jiang, H.; Rao, Z.; Zhang, L.; Xu, Y.; Yang, H.; Liu, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.996348v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.996348v1?rss=1,2020-03-28,2020-03-28,,False
839,SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray for mapping COVID-19 antibody interactions at amino acid resolution,"COVID-19 has quickly become a worldwide pandemic, which has significantly impacted the economy, education, and social interactions. Understanding the humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat COVID-19 infection. However, no immuno-proteomics platform exists that can perform such proteome-wide analysis. To address this need, we created a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is ~2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg/mL. Here, the SARS-CoV-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for SARS-CoV-1 proteins can also target SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These readily available reagents could be used immediately in COVID-19 research. Second, IgM and IgG immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were profiled in the serum of ten COVID-19 patients. Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to COVID-19 and are potential targets for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor were identified. Further investigation into whether these antibodies can inhibit the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted. Antibody and epitope profiling in response to COVID-19 is possible with our peptide-based SARS-COV-2 proteome microarray. The data gleaned from the array could provide invaluable information to the scientific community to understand, detect, and treat COVID-19.","Wang, H.; Hou, X.; Wu, X.; Liang, T.; Zhang, X.; Wang, D.; Teng, F.; Dai, J.; Duan, H.; Guo, S.; Li, Y.; Yu, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.994756v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.994756v1?rss=1,2020-03-28,2020-03-28,,False
840,A Simple Mathematical Model for Estimating the Inflection Points of COVID-19 Outbreaks,"Background: Exponential-like infection growths leading to peaks (which could be the inflection points or turning points) are usually the hallmarks of infectious disease outbreaks including coronaviruses. To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (Tmax) & maximal infection number (Imax) of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to obtain satisfactory results. Method: Inspired by its success in diversity-time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks. The model was previously used to extend the classic species-time relationship (STR) for general DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two secondary parameters (computed from its 3 parameters including power law scaling parameter w, taper-off parameter d to overwhelm virtually exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was originally used for estimating the potential or dark biodiversity is proposed to estimate the maximal infection number (Imax) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding inflection time point (Tmax). Results: We successfully estimated the inflection points [Imax, Tmax] for most provinces ({approx} 85%) in China with error rates <5% in both Imax and Tmax. We also discussed the constraints and limitations of the proposed approach, including (i) sensitive to disruptive jumps, (ii) requiring sufficiently long datasets, and (iii) limited to unimodal outbreaks.","Ma, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
841,History of Coronary Heart Disease Increases the Mortality Rate of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients: A Nested Case-Control Study Based on Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases in Mainland China,"Background: China has experienced an outbreak of a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) since December 2019, which quickly became a worldwide pandemic in early 2020. There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidities for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has important implications for early treatment. Objective: Evaluate the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design. A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, China, between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 2020 were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse-probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed. Results: History of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% higher risk of death (p<0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with CHD was three times of those without CHD (p<0.001). The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-year-old female with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), while it was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased death risk: every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).

842,Clinical Characteristics Hospitalized Patients with SARS-Cov-2 and HBV Co-infection,"Background & Aims The coronavirus disease 2019 (COIVD-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been characterized as a pandemic, which causes a serious public health challenge in the world. A very large group of patients infected by HBV has been reported worldwide, especially in China. In order to answer whether specific treatment strategy on the patients coinfected with HBV and SARS-CoV-2, it requires profound understanding of the clinical characteristics on those patients. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV patients remain largely unknown. Approach & Results In this retrospective investigation, we included 123 COVID-19 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 5 to March 7, 2020. All enrolled patients are the laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases according to the criteria reported previously. A total of 123 patients were analyzed for their Clinical records, laboratory results including the diagnosis of HBV infection and liver function. Among 123 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 51 years old and 59.3% were females (73/123). Fifteen were previously HBV infected patients, 66.7% of them were males (10/15), patients with HBV infection appeared to have a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and an increased level of total bilirubin. Seven (46.7%) patients with HBV infection were defined as severe cases, while the severity rate was 24.1% for the patients without HBV infection (26/108). The mortality of patients with HBV infection was 13.3% (2/15) compared to 2.8% (3/108) for the patients without HBV infection. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause liver function damage in COVID-19 cases and the patients with HBV infection are likely to have more severe disease outcome.","Chen, X.; Jiang, Q.; Ma, Z.; Ling, J.; Hu, W.; Cao, Q.; Mo, P.; Yang, R.; Gao, S.; Gui, X.; Xiong, Y.; Li, J.; Zhang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040733v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040733v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

There is urgent need for accurate and rapid diagnostic kits. Here we report the development and validation of a COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology ELISA kit for the detection of total anti-virus antibody (IgG+IgM) titers in sera from either the general population or patients suspected to be infected. For indirect ELISA, CHO-expressed recombinant full length SARS-CoV-2-S1 protein with 6*His tag was used as the coating antigen to capture the SARS-CoV-2-S1 antibodies specifically. The specificity of the ELISA kit was determined to be 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human sera including 257 samples collected prior to the outbreak and 155 collected during the outbreak. The sensitivity of the ELISA kit was determined to be 97.5% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. Most importantly, in one case study, the ELISA test kit was able to identify an infected person who had previously been quarantined for 14 days after coming into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, and discharged after testing negative twice by nucleic acid test. With the assays developed here, we can screen millions of medical staffs in the hospitals and people in residential complex, schools, public transportations, and business parks in the epidemic centers of the outbreaks to fish out the ""innocent viral spreaders"", and help to stop the further spreading of the virus.","Zhao, R.; Li, M.; Song, H.; Chen, J.; Ren, W.; Feng, Y.; Song, J.-W.; Peng, Y.; Su, B.; Guo, X.; Wang, Y.; Chen, J.; Li, J.; Sun, H.; Bai, Z.; Cao, W.

844,Core Outcome Set for Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Clinical Trials of COVID-19,"Background: Development of a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials for COVID-19 is urgent because of the pandemic wreaking havoc worldwide and the heterogeneity of outcomes in clinical trials. Methods: A preliminary list of outcomes were developed after a systematic review of protocols of clinical trials for COVID-19. Then, two rounds of the Delphi survey were conducted. Stakeholders were traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) experts, Western medicine (WM) experts, nurses and the public. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were also invited to participate in a questionnaire written in understandable language. Frontline clinicians, as well as nurse, methodologist, evidence based-medicine researcher, and staff from the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry participated by video conference to vote. Results: Ninety-seven eligible study protocols were identified from 160 clinical trials. Seventy-six outcomes were identified from TCM clinical trials and 126 outcomes were identified from WM clinical trials. Finally, 145 outcomes were included in the first round of the Delphi survey. Then, a COS for clinical trials of TCM and WM was developed. The COS include clinical outcomes (recovery/improvement/progression/death), etiology (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid tests, viral load), inflammatory factor (C-reactive protein), vital signs (temperature, respiration), blood and lymphatic-system parameters (lymphocytes, virus antibody), respiratory outcomes (Pulmonary imaging, blood oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, arterial blood gas analysis, mechanical ventilation, oxygen intake, pneumonia severity index), clinical efficacy (prevalence of preventing patients with mild-to-moderate disease progressing to severe disease), symptoms (clinical symptom score).

845,World governments should protect their population from COVID-19 pandemic using Italy and Lombardy as precursor,"The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading worldwide. Italy emerged early on as the country with the largest outbreak outside Asia. The outbreak in Northern Italy demonstrates that it is fundamental to contain the virus' spread at a very early stage of diffusion. At later stages, no containment measure, even if strict, can prevent the saturation of the hospitals and of the intensive care units in any country. Here we show that it is possible to predict when the intensive care units will saturate, within a few days from the first cases of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Using early counts of intensive care patients, we predict the saturation for Lombardy, Italy. Governments should use the Italian precursor to control the outbreak of COVID-19 and prevent the saturation of their intensive care units to protect their population.","Supino, M.; d'Onofrio, A.; Luongo, F.; Occhipinti, G.; Dal Co, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20042713v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20042713v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
846,The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 936 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 45% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies collectively have had significant effects slowing this growth, although policy actions in the US appear to be too recent to have a substantial impact since the magnitude of these effects grows over time. Our results suggest that similar policies may have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large and beneficial health outcomes. We estimate that, to date, current policies have already prevented or delayed on the order of eighty-million infections. These findings may help inform whether or when ongoing policies should be lifted or intensified, and they can support decision-making in the over 150 countries where COVID-19 has been detected but not yet achieved high infection rates.","Hsiang, S.; Allen, D.; Bell, K.; Bolliger, I.; Annan-Phan, S.; Chong, T.; Druckenmiller, H.; Hultgren, A.; Huang, L.

Here, testing a pooling approach for the standard RT-qPCR test, we find that a single positive sample can be detected even in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories.

During the following weeks, nine healthcare workers (HCWs) were diagnosed with COVID-19 in two Dutch teaching hospitals, eight of whom had no history of travel to China or Northern-Italy. A low-threshold screening regimen was implemented to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs in these two hospitals. Methods HCWs who suffered from fever or respiratory symptoms were voluntarily tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Findings Thirteen-hundred fifty-three (14%) of 9,705 HCWs employed were tested, 86 (6%) of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most HCWs suffered from relatively mild disease and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Seventy-nine (92%) HCWs met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. None of the HCWs identified through the screening reported a travel history to China or Northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported to have been exposed to an inpatient known with COVID-19 prior to the onset of symptoms. Interpretation Within two weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with SARS-CoV-2, probably caused by acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, asks for less stringent use of the currently recommended case-definition for suspected COVID-19.","Kluytmans, M.; Buiting, A.; Pas, S.; Bentvelsen, R.; van den Bijllaardt, W.; van Oudheusden, A.; van Rijen, M.; Verweij, J.; Koopmans, M.; Kluytmans, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041913v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041913v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

851,Elevated serum IgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia: A retrospective case-control study,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia outbreak began in Wuhan and pandemics tend to occur. Although SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients, their dynamics and association with outcomes have not been characterized. Methods: A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins tested in Tongji hospital were retrospectively investigated. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes data were compared between mild-moderate group and died group. Further, a paired case-control study was conducted where each deceased case was matched to three mild-moderate patients of similar age. Findings: Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Serum IgM levels were higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.024), but not IgG. Serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P = 0.033, resp.).

In case-control study paired by age, serum IgM was higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.019), positively correlated with leucocyte count (r = 0.260, P = 0.045), while negatively correlated with clinical outcome and albumin levels (r = -0.337, P = 0.008; r = -0.265, P = 0.041). AUC for IgM levels was 0.704 (95% CI: 0.534-0.873, P = 0.019). Interpretation: These results indicate that dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies was similar with that of SARS-CoV, while elevated serum IgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Wang, Z.; Li, H.; Li, J.; Yang, C.; Guo, X.; Hu, Z.; Chen, Z.; Wang, S.; Liu, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041285v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041285v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
852,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"Following the outbreak of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 in Wuhan, China late 2019, different countries have put in place interventions such as travel ban, proper hygiene, and social distancing to slow the spread of this novel virus. We evaluated the effects of travel bans in the Australia context and projected the epidemic until May 2020. Our modelling results closely align with observed cases in Australia indicating the need for maintaining or improving on the control measures to slow down the virus.","Adekunle, A.

853,Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding and impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir treatment in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Background: The duration of viral shedding is central to guide decisions around isolation precautions and antiviral treatment. However, studies about risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the potential impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment remain scarce. Methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had RT-PCR conversion at the NO.3 People's hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020. We compared clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. Results: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18-32 days). Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The median duration of viral shedding was shorter in the LPV/r treatment group (n=78) than that in no LPV/r treatment group (n=42) (median, 22 days vs. 28.5 days, p=0.02). Only earlier administration of LPV/r treatment ([&le;]10 days from symptom onset) could shorten the duration of viral shedding. Conclusions: Older age and lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19. Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding.","Yan, D.; Liu, X.-y.; Zhu, Y.-n.; Huang, L.; Dan, B.-t.; Zhang, G.-j.; Gao, Y.-h.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040832v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040832v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
854,Systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 infection,"Objective To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of models that aim to predict either (i) presence of existing COVID-19 infection, (ii) future complications in individuals already diagnosed with COVID-19, or (iii) models to identify individuals at high risk for COVID-19 in the general population. Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Data sources PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 24th March 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full text. Data extraction Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and prediction model performance. Results 2696 titles were screened. Of these, 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal. We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (13 of which were machine learning utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and ten prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to a severe state, or length of hospital stay. Only one of these studies used data on COVID-19 cases outside of China. Most reported predictors of presence of COVID-19 in suspected patients included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. Most reported predictors of severe prognosis in infected patients included age, sex, features derived from CT, C-reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. Estimated C-index estimates for the prediction models ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in those for the general population (reported for all 3 general population models), from 0.81 to > 0.99 in those for diagnosis (reported for 13 of the 18 diagnostic models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in those for prognosis (reported for 6 of the 10 prognostic models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion COVID-19 related prediction models are quickly entering the academic literature, to support medical decision making at a time where this is urgently needed. Our review indicates proposed models are poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Thus, their reported performance is likely optimistic and using them to support medical decision making is not advised. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed prediction models and validating (evaluating) existing models. The aforementioned predictors identified in multiple included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. We also stress the need to follow methodological guidance when developing and validating prediction models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD statement to facilitate validating, appraising, advocating and clinically using the reported models.

855,A demographic adjustment to improve measurement of COVID-19 severity at the developing stage of the pandemic,"The need for accurate statistics has never been felt so deeply as the novel COVID-19 pathogen spreads around the world and quantifying its severity is a primary clinical and public health issue. In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age. When applied to publicly released data for Italy, we show that until March 16 our adjusted CFR was similar to that of Wuhan, the most affected Chinese region, where COVID-19 has now been contained. This indicates that our adjusted CFR improves its comparability over time, making an important tool to chart the course of the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. Since March 16, the Italian COVID-19 outbreak has entered a new phase, with the northern and southern regions following different trajectories. As a result, our adjusted CFR has been increasing between March 16 and March 20. Data at the subnational level are needed to correctly assess the disease severity in the country at this stage.","Bignami, S.; Ghio, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040998v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040998v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
856,Reproducibility and reporting practices in COVID-19 preprint manuscripts,"The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has sparked an outflow of scientific research seeking to understand the virus, its spread, and best practices in prevention and treatment. If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contrast between the commitment of researchers to doing important research and their reporting practices reveals underlying weaknesses in reporting habits, but not necessarily their science.","Sumner, J.

857,Clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019,"BACKGROUND There is little information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19 from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women and newborns. RESULTS Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.6%. CONCLUSIONS This report suggests that pregnant women are not at increased risk for severe illness or mortality with Covid-19 compared with the general population. The SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy might not be associated with as adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes that are seen with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection during pregnancy.

858,Modeling for Corona Virus Outbreak in IRAN,"Background: As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is a worldwide pandemic it is rapidly expanding in Iran realtime analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. In this study we built a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. we will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases deaths and recovered for the whole country. Method: In this study we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages of past daily values of the series. This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree more recent values are given a greater weight. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season. Trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time. Results: If no control measures are put in place it is expected that over 40000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success one would expect the spread of the COV19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID19 to continue on a gentle incline reaching 21000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the confirmed deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Years celebration Farvardin first month of Spring (30th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event. The best predictive model predicts the confirmed cases to be in the range of 35000 70000 with the number of reported COVDI-19 deaths to be between 3000 5000 and 5000 30000 of recovered cases. Conclusions: Modeling outbreak ofCovid19 shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing. In addition many factors are effective in stopping the disease. These include citizens participation in the prevention process health education the effectiveness of instructive traditions environmental conditions and so on.","Moghadami, M.; Moghadami, M.; Hassanzadeh, M.; wa, k.; Hedayati, A.; Malekolkalami, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20041095v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20041095v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
859,Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor sterilization of N95 respirators for reuse,"Abstract Reprocessing of used N95 respirators may ameliorate supply chain constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative. The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus. We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce HP vapors. Virucidal activity was measured by a standard plaquing assay prior to and after sterilization. A single HP vapor cycle resulted in complete eradication of phage from masks (limit of detection 10 PFU, lower than the infectious dose of the majority of respiratory viral pathogens). After 5 cycles, the respirators appeared similar to new with no deformity. Use of a Bioquell machine can be scaled to permit simultaneous sterilization of a large number of used but otherwise intact respirators. HP vapor reprocessing may ease shortages and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative to non-NIOSH masks.","Kenney, P.; Chan, B.

860,COVID-19 in Canada: Predictions for the future and control lessons from Asia,"COVID-19 has spread with unequal efficiency in various parts of the world. In several European countries including Italy, the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has followed a consistent, exponential pattern of spread. However, some countries, notably Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved a different outcome and have managed to bring the COVID-19 outbreak in their countries rapidly under control, without entering the exponential pattern and with very few cases. They have used several different approaches to COVID-19 outbreak control, including the innovative use of smartphone technology and the widespread use of surgical face masks. We show through our models, that Canada has followed the same, consistent COVID-19 exponential growth pattern that is seen in Italy. Both nationally and in its most heavily affected provinces, there is exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, making it possible to make predictions for the future, if no further interventions are made in public health policy. In particular, we argue for the urgent introduction of surgical face masks in health care and other settings and the harnessing of the power of smartphone technology on a national scale.","Christian, C.; Christian, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040667v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040667v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
861,Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by assortative mixing patterns and reactive school closures which decrease mixing between children, or by children exhibiting lower susceptibility to infection, or by children having a lower propensity to show clinical symptoms. We formally test these hypotheses by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries, finding strong age dependence in the probability of developing clinical symptoms, rising from around 20% in under 10s to over 70% in older adults. We find that interventions aimed at halting transmission in children may have minimal effects on preventing cases depending on the relative transmissibility of subclinical infections. Our estimated age-specific clinical fraction has implications for the expected global burden of clinical cases because of demographic differences across settings. In younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.","Davies, N.

862,ACE2 Expression is Increased in the Lungs of Patients with Comorbidities Associated with Severe COVID-19,"The pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in several thousand deaths worldwide in just a few months. Patients who died from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a crucial factor that facilitates SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter host cells. To date, no study has assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of developing severe COVID-19. We also found other genes, such as RAB1A, that can be important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. Correlation and network analyses revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. In fact, epigenetic marks found in ACE2 locus were compatible to with those promoted by KDM5B. Our systems biology approach offers a possible explanation for increase of COVID-19 severity in patients with certain comorbidities.","Pinto, B. G.; Oliveira, A.

863,On the assessment of more reliable COVID-19 infected number: the italian case.,"COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most recent pandemic disease the world is currently managing. It started in China at the end of 2019, and it is diffusing throughout Italy, one of the most affected countries, and it is currently spreading through European countries and USA. Patients affected by COVID-19 are identified employing medical swabs applied mainly to (i) citizens with COVID-19 symptoms such as flu or high temperature, or (ii) citizens that had contacts with COVID-19 patients. A percentage of COVID-19 affected patients needs hospitalisation, whereas a portion needs to be treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Nevertheless, it is a matter of current intuition that COVID-19 infected citizens are more than those detected, and sometime the infection is detected too late. Thus there are many efforts in both tracking people activities as well as diffusing low cost reliable COVID-19 tests for early detection. Starting from mortality rates of diseases caused by viruses in the same family (e.g. MERS, SARS, H1N1), we study the relations between the number of COVID-19 infections and the number of deaths, through Italian regions. We thus assess several infections being higher than the ones currently measured. We thus focus on the characterisation of the pandemic diffusion by estimating the infected number of patients versus the number of death. We use such an estimated number of infections, to foresee the effects of restriction actions adopted by governments to constrain virus diffusion. We finally think that our model can support the healthcare system to react when COVID-19 is increasing.","Tradigo, G.; Guzzi, P.

Here we review the curves of epidemic growth and decline of the virus in China using a phenomenological logistic growth model to summarize the dynamics of the outbreak using three parameters that characterize the epidemic's timing, rate and peak. During the initial phase, the number of cases doubled every 2.7 (range 2.2 - 4.4) days. The rate of increase in the number of reported cases peaked approximately 10 days after suppression measures were started on 23-25 January 2020. The peak in the number of reported sick cases occurred on average 18 days after the start of measures. From the time of starting measures till the peak, the number of cases increased by a factor 38.5 in the province Hubei, and by a factor 9.5 for all of China (range: 6.2-20.4 in the other provinces). Complete suppression took up to 2 months (range: 23-57d.), during which period severe restrictions, social distancing measures, testing and isolation of cases were in place. The suppression of the disease in China has been successful, acting as a beacon of hope for countries outside China where the epidemic is still in a phase of increase and authorities need to decide their course of action.","Zou, Y.; Pan, S.; Zhao, P.; Han, L.; Wang, X.; Knops, J.; van der Werf, W.; Hemerik, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043539v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043539v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

867,Severe airport sanitarian control could slow down the spreading of COVID-19 pandemics in Brazil,"Background. We investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease. After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. Methodology. We developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. Results. The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria. Finally, we proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of high poverty.","Ribeiro, S. P.; Dattilo, W.; Castro e Silva, A.; Reis, A.

868,Haplotype networks of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak,"The Diamond Princess (DP) cruise ship was put under quarantine offshore Yokohama, Japan, after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was confirmed as a COVID-19 case. We performed whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 directly from PCR-positive clinical specimens and conducted a haplotype network analysis of the outbreak. All tested isolates exhibited a transversion at G11083T, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 dissemination on the DP originated from a single introduction event before the quarantine started. Although further spreading might have been prevented by quarantine, some progeny clusters were linked to transmission through mass-gathering events in the recreational areas and direct transmission among passengers who shared cabins during the quarantine. This study demonstrates the usefulness of haplotype network analysis in identifying potential infection routes.","Sekizuka, T.; Itokawa, K.; Kageyama, T.; Saito, S.; Takayama, I.; Asanuma, H.; Naganori, N.; Tanaka, R.; Hashino, M.; Takahashi, T.; Kamiya, H.; Yamagishi, T.; Kakimoto, K.; Suzuki, M.; Hasegawa, H.; Wakita, T.; Kuroda, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041970v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041970v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
869,Immune Cell Profiling of COVID-19 Patients in the Recovery Stage by Single-Cell Sequencing,"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has recently affected over 200,000 people and killed more than 8000. Immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but it remains unclear for the change of key immune cell subsets and their states during COVID-19. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ten patients recovered from COVID-19. Compared with healthy control, COVID-19 induced a unique signature of immune cells in humans, especially in the early recovery stage (ERS). In ERS patients, T cells were decreased remarkably, while monocytes were increased. A detailed analysis of monocytes showed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with highly inflammatory genes expression, as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1B+ monocytes. For nature killer (NK) cells and T cells, CD4+ T cells were significantly decreased and expressed high level of inflammatory markers, while NK cells were increased. In addition, T cells were highly expanded clone, especially in CD4+ T memory cells and CD8+ T cells. Among B cells, plasma cells were increased remarkably, and naive B cells were reduced. Our study also identified several novel B cell receptor (BCR) changes (such as IGHV1-8 and IGHV3-7), and confirmed isotypes (IGKV3-11 and IGHV3-21) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23+IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicated that IL-1B and M-CSF may be novel candidate target gene for inflammatory storm, and TNFSF13, IL-18 and IL-4 may be benefit for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of inflammatory immune signature in early recovery stage, suggesting that the COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Our identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccine and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.","Wen, W.; Su, W.; Tang, H.; Le, W.; Zhang, X.; Zheng, Y.; Liu, X.; Xie, L.; Li, J.; Ye, J.; Cui, X.; Miao, Y.; Wang, D.; Dong, J.; Xiao, C.-L.; Chen, W.; Wang, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039362v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039362v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
870,The current state of COVID-19 in Australia: importation and spread,"Background: The rapid global spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unprecedented. The outbreak has quickly spread to more than 100 countries reporting over 100,000 confirmed cases. Australia reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th January 2020 and has since implemented travel restrictions to stop further introduction of the virus. Methods: We analysed daily global COVID-19 data published by the World Health Organisation to investigate the spread of the virus thus far. To assess the current risk of COVID-19 importation and local spread in Australia we predict international passenger flows into Australia during 2020. Findings: Our analysis of global data shows that Australia can expect a similar growth rate of reported cases as observed in France and the United States. We identify travel patterns of Australian citizens/residents and foreign travellers that can inform the implementation of new and the alteration of existing travel restrictions related to COVID-19. Interpretation: Our findings identify the risk reduction potential of current travel bans, based on the proportion of returning travellers to Australia that are residents or visitors. The similarity of the exponential growth in the epidemic curve in Australia to other countries guides forecasts of COVID-19 growth in Australia, and opportunities for drawing lessons from other countries with more advanced outbreaks.","Liebig, J.; Jurdak, R.; El Shoghri, A.; Paini, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043877v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043877v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
871,Transmission dynamics of SARS-COV-2 in China: impact of public health interventions,"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic. However, the impact of the public health interventions in China needs to be evaluated. We established a SEIRD model to simulate the transmission trend of China. In addition, the reduction of the reproductive number was estimated under the current forty public health interventions policies. Furthermore, the infection curve, daily transmission replication curve, and the trend of cumulative confirmed cases were used to evaluate the effects of the public health interventions. Our results showed that the SEIRD curve model we established had a good fit and the basic reproductive number is 3.38 (95% CI, 3.25-3.48). The SEIRD curve show a small difference between the simulated number of cases and the actual number; the correlation index (H2) is 0.934, and the reproductive number (R) has been reduced from 3.38 to 0.5 under the current forty public health interventions policies of China. The actual growth curve of new cases, the virus infection curve, and the daily transmission replication curve were significantly going down under the current public health interventions. Our results suggest that the current public health interventions of China are effective and should be maintained until COVID-19 is no longer considered a global threat.","Wenbao, W.; Yiqin, C.; Qi, W.; Ping, C.; Ye, H.; Shanwen, H.; Yan, W.; Zuxiong, H.; Wenxiang, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20036285v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20036285v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
872,Global profiling of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses of convalescents using a proteome microarray,"COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, and has become a global pandemic. There is no highly effective medicine or vaccine, most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response, especially the virus specific IgG and IgM responses. However, the IgG/ IgM responses is barely known. To enable the global understanding of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed. The microarray was applied to profile the IgG/ IgM responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had IgG/ IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified. In-depth analysis showed that the level of S1 IgG positively correlate to age and the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 IgG negatively correlate to Ly% (Lymphocyte percentage). This study presents the first whole picture of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics, effective treatment and vaccine.","Jiang, H.-w.; Li, Y.; Zhang, H.-n.; Wang, W.; Men, D.; Yang, X.; Qi, H.; Zhou, J.; Tao, S.-c.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039495v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039495v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

Following the identification of the first infections, on February 21, 2020, national authorities have put in place an increasing number of restrictions aimed at containing the outbreak and delaying the epidemic peak. Since March 12, the whole country is under lockdown. Here we provide the first quantitative assessment of the impact of such measures on the mobility and the spatial proximity of Italians, through the analysis of a large-scale dataset on de-identified, geo-located smartphone users. With respect to pre-outbreak averages, we estimate a reduction of 50% of the total trips between Italian provinces, following the lockdown.

This study aimed to assess the disease status of IBD patients in Hubei province by questionnaire online and guide to the self-management of IBD patients during this epidemic. Methods: A questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the Partial Mayo Score (PMS), the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed to Hubei IBD patients online within one month of traffic control after the outbreak of COVID-19. This questionnaire also included some questions about patients' self-report disease conditions and their epidemiological history of COVID-19. Results: A total of 102 eligible questionnaires were included in the analysis. No patient reported infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in our study. Our result showed that 69.64% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 80.44% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were in remission. There was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the active disease stage between the two types of disease (p=0.103). The majority of patients (85.29%) had a good health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SIBDQ[&ge;]50). The reduction in physical exercise is a risk factor for worsening in conditions (OR=17.593, 95%CI 2.035 to 152.097, p=0.009). Conclusions: The outbreak of COVID-19 might not have a significant impact on most Hubei IBD patients within one month after the traffic control.

No studies have yet summarised the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We synthesised a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 6.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. Conclusion: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.","Alqahtani, J. S.; Oyelade, T.; Aldhahir, A. M.; Alghamdi, S.

876,Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Prevalence in Santa Clara County,"To reliably estimate the demand on regional health systems and perform public health planning, it is necessary to have a good estimate of the prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in the population. In the absence of wide-spread testing, we provide one approach to infer prevalence based on the assumption that the fraction of true infections needing hospitalization is fixed and that all hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara are identified. Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size. Our analysis suggests that as of March 17, 2020, there are 6,500 infections (0.34% of the population) of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If the shelter-in-place led to R0 < 1, we would expect the number of infections to remain about constant for the next few weeks. However, even if this were true, we expect to continue to see an increase in hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in the short term due to the fact that infection of SARS-CoV-2 on March 17th can lead to hospitalizations up to 14 days later.","Yadlowsky, S.; Shah, N.; Steinhardt, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043067v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043067v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

This study sought to elucidate a novel predictor of disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cased by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients enrolled in this study were all hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal validation. Results: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia and 260 with non-severe pneumonia. The independent risk factors for severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036-1.082; p < 0.001], N/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180-1.481; p < 0.001), CRP (OR: 1.231, 95% CI: 1.129-1.341; p = 0.002), and D-dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013-1.107; p = 0.011). We identified a product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer as having an important predictive value for the severity of COVID-19. The cutoff value was 5.32. The negative predictive value of less than 5.32 for the N/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75%, while the positive predictive value was 46.03% in the test sets.

880,Anti-hypertensive Angiotensin II receptor blockers associated to mitigation of disease severity in elderly COVID-19 patients,"Summary Background The novel coronavirus (CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 outbreak started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread over 100 countries. SARS-CoV-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. Indeed, it was reported that the balance of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACE2, was altered in COVID-19 patients. It is controversial, however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) shall be continued in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in disease severity between COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity. The included COVID-19 patients used ACEI, ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), beta blockers (BB), or thiazide to treat preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any of those drugs. Methods In this multicentre retrospective study, clinical data of 511 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Patients were categorized into six sub-groups of hypertension comorbidity based on treatment using one of anti-hypertension drugs (ACEI, ARB, CCB, BB, thiazide), or none. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of ACEI and ARB associated with pneumonia using published studies. Findings Among the elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19-S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in patients who took ARB drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs (OR=0.343, 95% CI 0.128-0.916, p=0.025). The meta-analysis showed that ARB use has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumonia. Interpretation Elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity who are taking ARB anti-hypertension drugs may be less likely to develop severe lung disease compared to patients who take no anti-hypertension drugs.

881,"Lactate dehydrogenase, a Risk Factor of Severe COVID-19 Patients","BACKGROUND The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of global concern. Updated analysis of cases might help identify the characteristic and risk factors of the illness severity. METHODS We extracted data regarding 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 18, 2020. The degree of severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at the time of admission according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RESULTS The median age was 64.91 years, 26 cases (55.31%) were male of which, and 70.83% were severe cases. Severe patients had higher APACHE II (9.92 vs 4.74) and SOFA (3.0 vs 1.0) scores on admission, as well as the higher PSI (86.13 vs 61.39), Curb-65 (1.14 vs 0.48) and CT semiquantitative scores (5.0 vs 2.0) when compared with non-severe patients. Among all univariable parameters, APACHE II, SOFA, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, AST, cTnI, BNP, et al were significantly independent risk factors of COVID-19 severity. Among which, LDH was most positively related both with APACHE II (R = 0.682) and SOFA (R = 0.790) scores, as well as PSI (R = 0.465) and CT (R = 0.837) scores. To assess the diagnostic value of these selected parameters, LDH (0.9727) had maximum sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (86.67%), with the cutoff value of 283. As a protective factor, lymphocyte counts less than 1.045 x 109 /L showed a good accuracy for identification of severe patients with AUC = 0.9845 (95%CI 0.959-1.01), the maximum specificity (91.30%) and sensitivity (95.24%). In addition, LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP and cTnI, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte cells and its subsets, including CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that LDH coule be identified as a powerful predictive factor for early recognition of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases. And importantly, lymphocyte counts, especially CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, which was relevant with serum LDH, were also dynamically correlated with the severity of the disease.

882,"Acute gastrointestinal injury in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China","Background: To investigate the prevalence and outcomes of acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this clinical retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected. The primary endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-day mortality, the secondary endpoints were organ dysfunction and septic shock incidence. Results: From February 10 to March 10 2020, 83 critically ill patients of 1314 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Seventy-two (86.7%) patients had AGI during hospital stay, of them, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade II, 5 had AGI grade III, and 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above was 50.6%. As of March 16, 40 (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission, the median hospital stay was 12.0 days, ranging from 3 days to 27 days. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome developed in 58 (69.9%) patients, septic shock in 16 (19.3%) patients. Patients with worse AGI grades had worse clinical variables, higher septic shock incidence and 28-day mortality. Sequential organ failure assessment scores (SOFA) (95% CI, 1.374-2.860; P <0.001), white blood cell (WBC) counts (95% CI, 1.037-1.379; P =0.014), duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) (95% CI, 1.020-1.340; P =0.025) were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above. Non-survivors were accompanied by higher incidence of AGI grade III to IV than survivors (17.5% vs. 0.0%, P =0.004). Conclusions: The AGI incidence was 86.7%, and hospital mortality was 48.2% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. SOFA scores, WBC counts, and duration of MV were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above.

883,Coincidence of COVID-19 epidemic and olfactory dysfunction outbreak,"Background Recent surge of olfactory dysfunction in patients who were referred to ENT clinics and concurrent COVID-19epidemic in Iran motivated us to evaluate anosmic/hyposmic patients to find any relation between these two events. Methods This is a cross-sectional study with an online checklist on voluntary cases in all provinces of Iran between the 12th and 17th March, 2020. Cases was defined as self-reported anosmia/hyposmia in responders fewer than 4 weeks later (from start the of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran). Variables consist of clinical presentations, related past medical history, family history of recent respiratory tract infection and hospitalization. Results In this study 10069 participants aged 32.5 +/- 8.6 (7-78) years, 71.13% female and 81.68% non-smoker completed online checklist. They reported 10.55% a history of a trip out of home town and 1.1% hospitalization due to respiratory problems recently. From family members 12.17% had a history of severe respiratory disease in recent days and 48.23% had anosmia/hyposmia. Correlation between the number of olfactory disorder and reported COVID-19 patients in all 31 provinces till 16th March 2020 was highly significant (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.87, p-Value<0.001). The onset of anosmia was sudden in 76.24% and till the time of filling the questionnaire in 60.90% of patients decreased sense of smell was constant. Also 83.38 of this patients had decreased taste sensation in association with anosmia. Conclusions It seems that we have a surge in outbreak of olfactory dysfunction happened in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic. The exact mechanism of anosmia/hyposmia in COVID-19 patients needs further investigations.","Bagheri, S. H. R.; Asghari, A. M.; Farhadi, M.; Shamshiri, A. R.; Kabir, A.; Kamrava, S.

884,"Critical Care for Patients with Severe Covid-2019 in Sichuan Province, China: Provincial Cohort Study","Background: Data regarding critical care for patients with severe Covid-19 are limited. We aimed to describe the clinical course and critical care implemented for this patient population at the provincial level in Sichuan, China. Methods: In this population-based multicenter cohort study, conducted from January 16 to March 15, 2020, all microbiologically confirmed Covid-19 patients who met the national severe or critical criteria were included and followed-up until discharge, death, or the end of the study. Results: Out of 539 confirmed Covid-19 patients, 81 severe cases (15.0%) were identified. The median (IQR) age was 50 (39-65) years, 37% were female, and 53.1% had chronic comorbidities. Among the five predefined criteria for severe illness, low PaO2:FiO2 ratio (<300 mmHg), low pulse oxygen saturation ([&le;]93%), and dyspnea were the most commonly reported, accounting for 87.7%, 66.7% and 27.2% of the severe cases, respectively. The median period from the onset of symptoms to the first hospitalization was 3 (1-6) days. Seventy-seven patients (95.06%) were admitted to hospitals being able to provide critical care by day 1. By day 28, 53 (65.4%) were discharged, 3 (3.7%) were deceased, and 25 (30.9%) were still hospitalized. Conventional oxygen therapy, administered to 95.1% of the patients, was the most commonly used respiratory support and met 62.7% of the respiratory support needed, followed by high-flow nasal cannula (19.5%) and noninvasive mechanical ventilation (10%). Conclusions: Early identification, hospitalization, and provision of critical care to severe Covid-19 patients may improve prognosis.

885,Gastrointestinal tract symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019: Analysis of clinical symptoms in adult patients,"Objective: To investigate the clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly the incidence of gastrointestinal tract symptoms. Design: We enrolled adult COVID-19 patients from a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan with a definitive diagnosis by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in which the patient selected COVID-19-related symptoms and report the time of onset and duration of symptoms. Results: A total of 212 adults were enrolled in this study, of which 127 (59.9%) were females, mean age was 48.50 (range: 17-79) years, and mean disease course was 26.78 (3-60) days. Fever and cough were the most common and earliest clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Diarrhoea occurred in 43.8% (93/212) of patients, of which 86.0% (80/93) had mushy stools. Nausea and vomiting were also common (20.7%). Diarrhoea lasted for 4.00(2.00-8.85) days and mostly occurred 5.00(0.25-11.00) days after the emergence of the first symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that diarrhoea was significantly correlated with fatigue [OR2.900,95%CI (1.629-5.164), p<0.0001].

886,Population-Level Mortality Rates from Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in South Korea,"Background: South Korea was among the first countries to report a case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outside of China. As of 22 March, 2020, South Korea reported 8897 confirmed cases of and 104 deaths from COVID-19. Methods: We collected the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths in South Korea from the World Health Organization (as of 21 March, 2020) and case distribution and fatality rates by age from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (as of 22 March, 2020). We estimated population-level mortality rates by fitting a negative binomial regression model with the number of deaths as the outcome and population by age as an offset. We then calculated the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) based on the current COVID-19 figures and for alternative scenarios of increased prevalence. Findings: The COVID-19 population-level mortality rate (per 100,000 person-years) increased with age: from 0.1 deaths among 30-39 year olds to 9.5 deaths among [&ge;]80 year olds. The ASDR (per 100,000 person-years) was 0.8 deaths. The ASDR would increase to 52.0 deaths at a 1% prevalence (becoming the third leading cause of death) and 155.9 deaths at 3% prevalence (becoming the leading cause of death). Interpretation: Currently, the population-level mortality burden of COVID-19 in South Korea, as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared to other causes of death partly due to the low prevalence of COVID-19. If the prevalence increases from another outbreak, the mortality burden could increase substantially and surpass other leading causes.","Soneji, S.; Beltran-Sanchez, H.; Yang, J.; Mann, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041814v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041814v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 250,000 confirmed cases as of March 21, 2020. An open-label clinical trial has just concluded, suggesting improved resolution of viremia with use of two existing therapies: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as monotherapy, and in combination with azithromycin (HCQ-AZ). The results of this important trial have major implications for global policy in the rapid scale-up and response to this pandemic. The authors present results with p-values for differences in proportions between the study arms, but their analysis is not able to provide effect size estimates. To address this gap, more modern analytical methods including survival models, have been applied to these data, and show modest to no impact of HCQ treatment, with more significant effects from the HCQ-AZ combination, potentially suggesting a role for co-infections in COVID-19 pathogenesis. The trial of Gautret and colleagues, with consideration of the effect sizes, and p-values from multiple models, does not provide sufficient evidence to support wide-scale rollout of HCQ monotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19; larger randomized studies should be considered.

Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.","Zhao, P.

892,Computational simulations reveal the binding dynamics between human ACE2 and the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"A novel coronavirus (the SARS-CoV-2) has been identified in January 2020 as the causal pathogen for COVID-19 pneumonia, an outbreak started near the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China. The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Plausible binding modes between human ACE2 and the RBD were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data further revealed critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2. The simulations showed that the N-terminal helix and the K353 of the human ACE2 alter the binding modes of the CoV2-RBD to the ACE2.","Liu, H.; Lupala, C.; Li, X.; Lei, J.; Chen, H.; Qi, J.; Su, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.005561v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.005561v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,False

Here we analyze bulk and single cell RNA-Seq datasets to identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express cell entry molecules that mediate infection by SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the causal agent in COVID-19. We find that samples from whole olfactory mucosa in species including mouse and human express two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, neither olfactory sensory neurons nor olfactory bulb neurons express these genes, which are instead expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells.

Older age and elevated d-dimer are reported risk factors for Covid-19. However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. A total of 128 patients were admitted. 102 patients were confirmed to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using RNA detection. As of March 20, 82 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 5 remained hospitalized. The median age was 57 years (range, 27 - 85), 59 (58%) were male, and 44 (43%) patients had a comorbidity. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older and more likely to have lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated d-dimer, and increased hypersensitive troponin I. In a multivariate regression model that included these predictors, older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality. Twenty-one survivors and 11 non-survivors had CT scans within the first week. We used severity score to quantify the extent of lung opacification as described in the Supplementary Appendix. The total severity score and number of involved lung lobes within the first week were significantly greater in non-survivors compared to survivors . Using univariate logistic regression analysis, higher total severity score ([&ge;]15) (odds ratio 53, 95% CI 3-369; p = 0.003), and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) (9, 2-53; p = 0.016) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients with CT data within the first week, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporated the predictors discussed above (older age, lymphocytopenia, elevated LDH, elevated d-dimer, and increased troponin I). For survivors with serial CT scans performed over four weeks, total severity score peaked in the second week. This report suggests that the extent of lung lesions in early CT images is a potential predictor of poor outcome of Covid-19. This will help clinicians to identify the patients with poor prognosis at early stage.","Li, K.; Chen, D.; Chen, S.; Feng, Y.; Chang, C.; Wang, Z.; Wang, N.; Zhen, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041673v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041673v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

Methods: A total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The plasma of these patients were collected during hospitalization and were detected for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Afterwards, the difference of IgG antibody between male and female patients was analyzed. Results: The level of IgG antibody in mild, general and recovering patients showed on difference between male and female. In severe status, the average IgG antibody level in female patients tended to be higher than that of in male patients. Compared with male patients, most of the female patients generated a relatively high level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in severe status. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female tended to be stronger than male patients in disease early phase. Conclusions: The inconsistent of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody generation in male and female patients may account for the different outcome of COVID-19 between gender.","Zeng, F.; Dai, C.; Cai, P.; Wang, J.; Xu, L.; Li, J.; Hu, G.; Wang, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20040709v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20040709v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV.","Dilucca, M.; Pavlopoulou, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.006569v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.006569v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,False
898,FDA approved drugs with broad anti-coronaviral activity inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China at the end of 2019 and has rapidly become a pandemic with over 400,000 recorded COVID-19 cases and greater than 19,000 recorded deaths by March 24th, 2020 (www.WHO.org) (1). There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2 (2). Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs (3). Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A potentially quicker way to test compounds with antiviral activity is through drug re-purposing (2, 4). Numerous drugs are already approved for use in humans and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to test in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on 20 FDA approved drugs tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that we have previously found to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (4). We find that 17 of these also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at a range of IC50 values at non-cytotoxic concentrations. From these we specifically followed up with hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate.","Weston, S.; Haupt, R.; Logue, J.; Matthews, K.; Frieman, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.008482v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.008482v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,False
899,Automatic Identification of SARS Coronavirus using Compression-Complexity Measures,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWFinding vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for global pandemic of virus diseases (such as the ongoing COVID-19) requires rapid analysis, annotation and evaluation of metagenomic libraries to enable a quick and efficient screening of nucleotide sequences. Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.

NoteThe main ideas and results of this research were first presented at the International Conference on Nonlinear Systems and Dynamics (CNSD-2013) held at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, December 12, 2013.

This innovative and general procedure, based on the representation of the molecular iso-electron density surface in terms of 2D Zernike polynomials, allows the rapid and quantitative assessment of the geometrical shape complementarity between interacting proteins, that was unfeasible with previous methods. We first tested the method with a large dataset of known protein complexes obtaining an overall area under the ROC curve of 0.76 in the blind recognition of binding sites and then applied it to investigate the features of the interaction between the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human cellular receptors. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 uses a dual strategy: its spike protein could also interact with sialic acid receptors of the cells in the upper airways, in addition to the known interaction with Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.","Milanetti, E.; Miotto, M.; Di Rienzo, L.; Monti, M.; Gosti, G.; Ruocco, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.006197v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.006197v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,False

After propensity score matching with demographics, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of parturients with or without COVID-19 were analysed. The anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes of themselves and their infants were compared in these two groups of parturients. Results: A total of 1,588 patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing cesarean delivery were retrospectively included. After achieving a balanced cohort through propensity score matching, 89 patients (COVID-19 group), who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test and CT scan matched with 173 patients without COVID-19 (Control group). The SARS-CoV-2 infected parturients in the early stages of COVID-19 outbreak was much more than during the later stage. The main clinical characteristics of parturients with COVID-19 were fever (34.8%), cough (33.7%), an increased plasma CRP (52.8%) and a decreased lymphocyte counting (33.7%). A high rate of emergency and a high incidence of anaesthesia-related complications, such as pharyngalgia, multiple puncture, intraoperative hypotension, nausea, vomiting, vertigo and chills in the COVID-19 parturients. In addition, the parturients with COVID-19 had a long duration of operation and hospital stay, and an increased intraoperative oxytocin utilization and postoperative oxygen therapy. The newborns from the SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, who received general anaesthesia, had a high risk of Apgar score [&le;]8 at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery and a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Conclusions: Anaesthesia-related complications occur more frequently in the COVID-19 parturients and their newborns have a high risk of distress.","Zhang, Y.; Chen, R.; Wang, J.; Gong, Y.; Zhou, Q.; Cheng, H.-h.; Xia, Z.-y.; Chen, X.; Meng, Q.-t.; Ma, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042176v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042176v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

While rapid and accessible diagnosis is paramount to monitoring and reducing the spread of disease, COVID-19 testing capabilities across the U.S. remain constrained. For many individuals, urgent care centers (UCCs) may offer the most accessible avenue to be tested.

903,Modeling COVID-19 epidemics in an Excel spreadsheet: Democratizing the access to first-hand accurate predictions of epidemic outbreaks,"COVID-19, the first pandemic of this decade and the second in less than 15 years, has harshly taught us that viral diseases do not recognize boundaries; however, they truly do discriminate between aggressive and mediocre containment responses. We present a simple epidemiological model that is amenable to implementation in Excel spreadsheets and sufficiently accurate to reproduce observed data on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemics in different regions (i.e., Italy, Spain, and New York City (NYC)). We also show that the model can be adapted to closely follow the evolution of COVID-19 in any large city by simply adjusting two parameters related to (a) population density and (b) aggressiveness of the response from a society/government to epidemics. Moreover, we show that this simple epidemiological simulator can be used to assess the efficacy of the response of a government/society to an outbreak.","Alvarez, M.

904,Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 pandemics,"The new coronavirus known as COVID-19 is rapidly spreading since December 2019. Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from Hubei resembling a Levy flight which is characteristic of human mobility and thus could be controlled by efficient quarantines. Since quarantine is usually applied on a city level, more insight can be obtained in analyzing the epidemic in cities. Our results suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is close to constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations. While most cities in China control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less social interactions control and overloaded health systems which reflects in the death and recovery rates.","Gross, B.; Zheng, Z.; Liu, S.; Chen, X.; Sela, A.; Li, J.; Li, D.; Havlin, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041517v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041517v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
905,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies. Until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. These measures largely disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban areas. Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity.","Stier, A.

906,Analysis of adaptive immune cell populations and phenotypes in the patients infected by SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread to most of countries in the world, threatening the health and lives of many people. Unfortunately, information regarding the immunological characteristics in COVID-19 patients remains limited. Here we collected the blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HD) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyze changes in the adaptive immune cell populations and phenotypes. In comparison to HD, the lymphocyte percentage was slightly decreased, the percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lymphocytes are similar, whereas B cell percentage increased in COVID-19 patients. T cells, especially CD8 T cells, showed an enhanced expression of late activation marker CD25 and exhaustion marker PD-1. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 induced an increased percentage of T follicular helpher (Tfh)- and germinal center B-like (GCB-like) cells in the blood. However, the parameters in COVD-19 patients remained unchanged across various age groups. Therefore, we demonstrated that the T and B cells can be activated normally and exhibit functional features. These data provide a clue that the adaptive immunity in most people could be primed to induce a significant immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection upon receiving standard medical care.","Yang, X.; Dai, T.; Zhou, X.; Qian, H.; Guo, R.; Lei, L.; Zhang, X.; Zhang, D.; Shi, L.; Cheng, Y.; Guo, Y.; Hu, J.; Zhang, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040675v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040675v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
907,Impact of changing case definitions for COVID-19 on the epidemic curve and transmission parameters in mainland China,"Background: When a new infectious disease emerges, appropriate case definitions are important for clinical diagnosis and also for public health surveillance. Tracking case numbers over time allows us to determine speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. Changing case definitions during an epidemic can affect these inferences. Methods: We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used simple models assuming exponential growth and then exponential decay to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the numbers of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. Findings: From January through to early March 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. As of February 20, there were 55,508 confirmed cases reported in mainland China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed from version 1 to 2, version 2 to 4 and version 4 to 5, the proportion of infections being detected as cases were increased by 7.1-fold (95% credible interval (CI): 4.8, 10.9), 2.8-fold (95% CI: 1.9, 4.2) and 4.2-fold (95% CI: 2.6, 7.3) respectively. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak, we estimated that by February 20 there would have been 232,000 (95% CI: 161,000, 359,000) confirmed cases. Interpretation: The case definition was initially narrow, but was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan or other known cases. This should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

908,Anaesthesia and infection control in cesarean section of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China, and soon caused an ongoing pandemic globally. In this study we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia (CSEA) and infection control measures on perinatal care quality of 30 pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19. Methods Individual demographic data, clinical outcomes, laboratory investigations of pregnant women and their newborns were collected from electronic medical records of the Maternal and Children Health Hospital of Hubei Province, during January 24 to February 29, 2020. Anaesthesia and surgery results were compared between pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection. Results Using CSEA in cesarean section was effective and safe for pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection. Administration of dezocine and morphine was effective as postoperative analgesia, and well tolerated in COVID-19 patients. The assessment of surgery outcomes also showed similar results in both confirmed and suspected cases. No respiratory failure nor distress were found in the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection and their neonates. None of these patients experienced severe obstetric complications related to anaesthesia and surgeries. No COVID-19 infection was reported in the neonates born to the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection and healthcare workers in these operations. Conclusions In cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, CSEA was safe and efficient in achieving satisfactory obstetrical anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia. No cross-infection occurred in the HCWs working in these operations.","Yue, L.; Han, L.; Li, Q.; Zhong, M.; Wang, J.; Wan, Z.; Chu, C.; Zeng, Y.; Peng, M.; Yang, L.; Li, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040394v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040394v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
909,Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran,"Background: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on existing data. Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemic's progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current ""true"" cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing. Findings: The model closely replicates the past data but also shows the true number of cases is likely far larger. We estimate about 493,000 current infected cases (90% CI: 271K-810K) as of March 20th, 2020. Our estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K). These numbers are significantly (more than one order of magnitude) higher than official statistics. The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M-2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K-97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K-172K). Implication: Our results suggest that the number of cases and deaths may be over an order of magnitude larger than official statistics in Iran. Absent extended testing capacity other countries may face a significant under-count of existing cases and thus be caught off guard about the actual toll of the epidemic.","Ghaffarzadegan, N.; Rahmandad, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040956v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040956v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
910,Global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2: from outbreak to pandemic,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods: We employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions. Results and Conclusions: The analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.","Skums, P.; Kirpich, A.; Icer Baykal, P.; Zelikovsky, A.; Chowell, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041145v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041145v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

912,Modelling SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics: Implications for Therapy,"The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which are useful for development of antiviral therapies.","Kim, K.

We assessed the effects of temperature and humidity on the global patterns of COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-March 2020. Climatic variables were the best drivers of global variation of confirmed COVID-19 cases growth rates. Growth rates peaked in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere with mean temperature of ~5 degrees, and humidity of approx 0.6-1 kPa during the outbreak month, while they decreased in warmer and colder regions.

914,Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM):A Novel Mechanical Ventilator Designed for Mass Scale Production in response to the COVID-19 Pandemics,"We present here the design of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a novel mechan- ical ventilator designed for mass scale production in response to the COVID-19 pandemics, to compensate for the dramatic shortage of such ventilators in many countries. This venti- lator is an electro-mechanical equivalent of the old, reliable Manley Ventilator. Our design is optimized to permit large sale production in short time and at a limited cost, relying on off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide from hardware suppliers. Operation of the MVM requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and electrical power. The MVM control and monitoring unit can be connected and networked via WiFi so that no additional electrical connections are necessary other than the connection to the electrical power. At this stage the MVM is not a certified medical device. Construction of the first proto- types is starting with a team of engineers, scientists and computing experts. The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the conceptual design of the MVM broadly and to solicit feed- back from the scientific and medical community to speed the process of review, improvement and possible implementation.","Cristiano, G.; Bonivento, W.; Caravati, M.; Razeti, M.; DeCecco, S.; Fiorillo, G.; Gabriele, F.; Tartaglia, R.; Razeto, A.; Sablone, D.; Scapparone, E.; Testera, G.; Rescigno, M.; Franco, D.; Kochanek, I.; Kendziora, C.; Pordes, S.

915,Serology characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection since the exposure and post symptoms onset,"Background Timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the prerequisite for treatment and preventive quarantine. The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of antibody test to RNA test needs to be demonstrated. Method A patient cohort study was conducted at the first affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Serial sera of COVID-19 patients were collected and total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected. The antibody dynamics during the infection were described. Results The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients was 98.8% (79/80), 93.8% (75/80) and 93.8% (75/80), respectively. The first detectible serology marker is total antibody and followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 day post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset, separately. The antibody levels increased rapidly since 6 d.p.o and accompanied with the decline of viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7d.p.o),Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to the IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p<0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG detection increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% two weeks later, respectively. Conclusions Typical acute antibody response is induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serology testing provides important complementation to RNA test for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patient. It should be strongly recommended to apply well-validated antibody tests in the clinical management and public health practice to improve the control of COVID-19 infection.","Lou, B.; Li, T.; Zheng, S.; Su, Y.; Li, Z.; Liu, W.; Yu, F.; Ge, S.; Zou, Q.; Yuan, Q.; Lin, S.; Hong, C.; Yao, X.; Zhang, X.; Wu, D.; Zhou, G.; Hou, W.; Li, T.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, S.; Fan, J.; Zhang, J.; Xia, N.; Chen, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041707v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041707v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
916,Modelling strategies to organize healthcare workforce during pandemics: application to COVID-19,"Protection of healthcare workforce is of paramount relevance for the care of infected and non-infected patients in the setting of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivity depending on the infection rate, the presence of reinfection and the efficiency of home office. As an application example, we apply our theory to the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The results of the models reveal that a desynchronization strategy in which two medical teams work alternating for 7 days reduces the infection rate of the healthcare workforce. In case of immunity to the infectious agent this affect is mainly relevant at early stages of the pandemic. This effect is independent on infection rates and increases the overall workforce productivity under certain situations.","Sanchez-Taltavull, D.; Candinas, D.; Roldan, E.; Beldi, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041863v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041863v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True
917,UV Sterilization of Personal Protective Equipment with Idle Laboratory Biosafety Cabinets During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and N95 respirators, is crucially important to the safety of both patients and medical personnel, particularly in the event of infectious pandemics. As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is increasing exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to safely expand the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment are critically important. In the recent days, weeks, and months, in the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve Personal Protective Equipment, including sterilization after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to sterilize N95 respirators, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which N95 respirators may be sterilized using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories. The primary obstacle to this approach is the possibility the UV radiation levels vary within BSCs. To account for this potential variation in dosing across the base of the BSC, we tested the UV-C radiation in two randomly chosen idle BSCs in our research institute and observed a maximum ratio between the minimum and maximum recorded intensities within a given BSC to be 1.98. Based on these values, we calculated that an N95 mask placed within a BSC with a manufacturer reported fluence of 100 W/cm^2 should be effectively sanitized for reuse after approximately 15-20 minutes per side. Our results provide support to healthcare organizations looking for alternative methods to extend their reserves of PPE. It is our hope that with an easily implemented strategy, as we have presented here, idle BSCs can be utilized to alleviate the PPE shortage by providing a way to sterilize PPE to allow safe daily re-use. This should be tested on a larger scale, and confirmed in a virology laboratory before adoption, though we contend that in extremis, this method would be preferred compared to re-use without sterilization.","Theory Division, Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute,; Card, K.

918,Exponential damping key to successful containment of COVID-19 outbreak,"Due to its excessively high capacity for human-to-human transmission, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first reported in Wuhan in China, spread rapidly to the entire nation and beyond, and has now been declared a global public health emergency. Understanding the transmission pattern of the virus and the efficacy of transmission control measures is crucial to ensuring regional and global disease control. Here we propose a simple model based on exponential infectious growth, but with a time-varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data from the 102 countries and regions which have reported cases for more than 6 days, and, we think, has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. We found that the damping rate, defined as the rate of the exponential decline in transmission rate, ranged from -0.125 to 0.513 d-1 globally (a negative damping rate represents acceleration in spread). The estimated peak time (when the fastest spread occurs) and the final number of infections were found to be greatly affected by the damping rate. Successful control measures, such as those implemented in China and South Korea, have resulted in a clear pattern of exponential damping in the viral spread (also shown during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The damping rate, therefore, could be used as an indicator for the efficacy of implemented control measures. Our model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide, especially rapidly in certain countries (e.g. USA and Australia) where exponential damping is yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to contain this global pandemic. Slight increments in the damping rate from additional control efforts, especially in countries showing weak or no exponential damping in COVID-19 transmission, could lead to a radically more positive outcome in the fight to contain the pandemic.","Zhang, F.; Zhang, J.; Cao, M.; Zhang, Y.; Hui, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041111v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041111v1?rss=1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,,True

During the initial isolation of 13 individuals confirmed positive with COVID-19 infection, air and surface samples were collected in eleven isolation rooms to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. While all individuals were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and viral shedding to the environment varied considerably. Many commonly used items, toilet facilities, and air samples had evidence of viral contamination, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is shed to the environment as expired particles, during toileting, and through contact with fomites. Disease spread through both direct (droplet and person-to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) are indicated, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions.","Santarpia, J.

920,A Fully Automatic Deep Learning System for COVID-19 Diagnostic and Prognostic Analysis,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally, and medical resources become insufficient in many regions. Fast diagnosis of COVID-19, and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resources optimization is important. Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography. We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from 7 cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images and gene information were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features. Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5+ days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system. In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014). Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings. Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimization and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.","Wang, S.; Zha, Y.; Li, W.; Wu, Q.; Li, X.; Niu, M.; Wang, M.; Qiu, X.; Li, H.; Yu, H.; Gong, W.; Bai, Y.; Li, L.; Zhu, Y.; Wang, L.; Tian, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042317v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042317v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True
921,"Risk Factors Associated with Clinical Outcomes in 323 COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan, China","Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (>10 x 109/L) and neutrophilia (>75 x 109/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.

922,A model to estimate bed demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization,"As of March 23, 2020 there have been over 354,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in over 180 countries, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the United States (US) announced a national state of emergency.1, 2, 3 In parts of China and Italy the demand for intensive care (IC) beds was higher than the number of available beds.4, 5 We sought to build an accessible interactive model that could facilitate hospital capacity planning in the presence of significant uncertainty about the proportion of the population that is COVID-19+ and the rate at which COVID-19 is spreading in the population. Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses. We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 and how these compare to the available resources. Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6 The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19+ arrivals for a hypothetical acute care medical center. The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23, the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27, and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model, the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need and provides an approach to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.","Zhang, T.; McFarlane, K.; Vallon, J.; Yang, L.; Xie, J.; Blanchet, J.; Glynn, P.; Staudenmayer, K.; Schulman, K.; Scheinker, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042762v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True
923,Metabolic disturbances and inflammatory dysfunction predict severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a retrospective study,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide with 16,558 deaths till date. Serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein have been known to be associated with the severity and mortality of community-acquired pneumonia. However, the characteristics and role of metabolic and inflammatory indicators in COVID-19 is unclear. Methods: We included 97 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory indices; radiological features; and treatment were analysed. The differences in the clinical and laboratory parameters between mild and severe COVID-19 patients and the role of these indicators in severity prediction of COVID-19 were investigated. Results: All were Wuhan residents with contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The median age was 39 years (IQR: 30-59). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (58.8%), cough (55.7%), and fatigue (33%). Other features were lymphopenia, impaired fasting glucose, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia. Decrease in lymphocyte count, serum total protein, serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% were found to be valuable in predicting the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe illness. Chest computed tomography (CT) images showed that the absorption of bilateral lung lesions synchronized with the recovery of metabolic and inflammatory indicators. Conclusions: Hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia, and decreased ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% could predict severity of COVID-19.

Methods: Adult suspected patients aged >18 years within 14 days who underwent chest CT scan and reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to results of RT-PCR tests. The data of basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for confirmed and non-confirmed groups. Results: A total of 130 patients were enrolled with 54 cases positive and 76 cases negative. The typical CT imaging features of positive group were ground glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally, close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features combined, GGO with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGO with pleural distribution were more common, of which were 31 cases (57.4%) and 30 cases (55.6%) respectively. The combinations were almost presented statistically significant (P<0.05) except for the combination of GGO with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations is around 90%. Conclusions: The combinations of GGO could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, which alerts clinicians to isolate patients for treatment promptly and repeat RT-PCR tests until incubation ends.","Miao, C.; Jin, M.; Miao, L.; Yang, X.; Huang, P.; Xiong, H.; Huang, P.; Zhao, Q.; Du, J.; Hong, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042432v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042432v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True
925,Estimating the number of undetected COVID-19 cases exported internationally from all of China,"During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, when SARS-CoV-2 was chiefly reported in the city of Wuhan, cases exported to other locations were largely predicted using flight travel data from Wuhan. However, given Wuhan's connectivity to other cities in mainland China prior to the lockdown, there has likely been a substantial risk of exportation of cases from other Chinese cities. It is likely that many of these exportations remained undetected because early international case definitions for COVID-19 required a recent travel history from Wuhan. Here, we combine estimates of prevalence in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight volume, accounting for the effects of travel bans and the timing of Lunar New Year, to approximate the number of cases exported from cities outside of Wuhan from early December 2019 to late February 2020. We predict that for every one case from Wuhan exported internationally, there were approximately 2.9 cases from large Chinese cities exported internationally that likely remained undetected. Additionally, we predict the number of exported cases in six destinations for which predictions on exported cases have yet to be made, surveillance has likely been low, and where health care systems will likely face issues in managing current or potential outbreaks. We observe heterogeneities in exported case counts across these destinations. The predicted number of cases exported to Egypt and South Africa exceeds the predicted number of cases exported to Mauritania. These trends may anticipate differences in the timing and emergence of local transmission in these countries. Our findings highlight the importance of setting accurate travel history requirements for case definition guidelines in the initial phase of an epidemic, and actively updating these guidelines as the epidemic advances.","Menkir, T.

We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at the provincial level in mainland China. Methods: The number of people infected by COVID-19 and SARS were extracted from daily briefings on newly confirmed cases during the epidemics, as of Mar. 4, 2020 and Aug. 3, 2003, respectively. We depicted the spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 and SARS epidemics using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). Results: Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher incidence. We identified 3 clusters (predominantly located in south-central China, highest RR=135.08) for COVID-19 and 4 clusters (mainly in Northern China, highest RR=423.51) for SARS. Fewer secondary clusters were identified after the ""Wuhan lockdown"". The LISA cluster map detected a significantly high-low (Hubei) and low-high spatial clustering (Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, in Central China) for COVID-19. Two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected for SARS, although the global Moran's I value was not significant.

927,Coast-to-coast spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States revealed by genomic epidemiology,"Since its emergence and detection in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to nearly every country around the world, resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections to date. The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.","Fauver, J. R.; Petrone, M.

928,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"We quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions, particularly the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, on the containment and delay of the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We employ a set of difference-in-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated ""actual"" cases narrows significantly. We also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere.","FANG, H.; WANG, L.; YANG, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042424v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042424v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True
929,Moving-average based index to evaluate the epidemic trend of COVID-19 outbreak,"A pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and then spread rapidly to the whole country. A total of 81,021 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 3,194 deaths (3.9%) had been reported in China by March 14, 2020, meanwhile, 61,518 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,199 deaths were reported outside China. Common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia included fever, fatigue and dry cough. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases, we have no history to learn from and no evidence to count on. Traditional models often predict inconsistent results. Aiming at estimate the epidemic trend timely after the outbreak, we mainly used 7-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named ""epidemic trend index"", which will be used to predict the evolutionary trend of the epidemic situation and support epidemic control decision making processes. We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong in 2003 to verify the practicability of the new index, which shows that the index is acceptable. The epidemic trend index was then applied to the COVID-19 epidemic analysis in China. The results show that during the epidemic, the trend direction of different districts of China changed on different date. In the whole country and in Hubei Province alone, the epidemic reached the peak on February 9. While the peak appeared earlier, i.e. on February 5 in other provinces. It indicated that decisive outbreak control measures of the Chinese government are effective. While local governments should adjust management measures based on local risk level of epidemic. Although the epidemic has eased since late February, continued efforts in epidemic control are still needed to accelerate the end of the epidemic in China. However, the global COVID-19 epidemic outside China continues to expand as indicated by the epidemic trend index we proposed. In order to cope with the novel coronavirus pandemic, people all over the world should work together and governments of all countries should take efficient measures in the light of China's experience and according to national circumstances and local conditions.","He, Y.-t.; He, H.; Zhai, J.; Wang, X.-j.; Wang, B.-s.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20027730v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20027730v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True
930,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","Background: We evaluated how non-pharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Methods: Using an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada, we compared a base case with limited testing, isolation, and quarantine to scenarios with: enhanced case finding; restrictive social distancing measures; or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive social distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon. Results: We estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107,000 (95% CrI: 60,760-149,000) cases in hospital and 55,500 (95% CrI: 32,700-75,200) cases in ICU. For fixed duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive social distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the two-year period. Dynamic social distancing interventions could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity. Interpretation: Without significant social distancing or a combination of moderate social distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic social distancing could maintain health system capacity and also allow periodic psychological and economic respite for populations.","Tuite, A.; Fisman, D. N.; Greer, A.

931,Home collection of nasal swabs for detection of influenza in the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation Study,"Background: Community based studies of influenza and other respiratory viruses (e.g. SARS-COV-2) require laboratory confirmation of infection. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. Methods: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens. Results: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A/H3N2, 23 for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza B/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A/H3N2 (0.70) and B/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A/H1N1 (0.87) and B/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78-86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96-100%, and slightly lower for A/H3N2 infections (88%). Conclusions: Collection of nasal swab specimens at home is both feasible and reliable for identification of influenza virus infections.","Malosh, R. E.; Petrie, J. G.; Callear, A. P.; Monto, A.

933,Fundamental principles of epidemic spread highlight the immediate need forlarge-scale serological surveys to assess the stage of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic,"The spread of a novel pathogenic infectious agent eliciting protective immunity is typically characterised by three distinct phases: (I) an initial phase of slow accumulation of new infections (often undetectable), (II) a second phase of rapid growth in cases of infection, disease and death, and (III) an eventual slow down of transmission due to the depletion of susceptible individuals, typically leading to the termination of the (first) epidemic wave. Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the population. We focus on model solutions which take into consideration previous estimates of critical epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number (R0), probability of death in the vulnerable fraction of the population, infectious period and time from infection to death, with the intention of exploring the sensitivity of the system to the actual fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease and death. Our simulations are in agreement with other studies that the current epidemic wave in the UK and Italy in the absence of interventions should have an approximate duration of 2-3 months, with numbers of deaths lagging behind in time relative to overall infections. Importantly, the results we present here suggest the ongoing epidemics in the UK and Italy started at least a month before the first reported death and have already led to the accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity in both countries. There is an inverse relationship between the proportion currently immune and the fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease. This relationship can be used to determine how many people will require hospitalisation (and possibly die) in the coming weeks if we are able to accurately determine current levels of herd immunity. There is thus an urgent need for investment in technologies such as virus (or viral pseudotype) neutralization assays and other robust assays which provide reliable read-outs of protective immunity, and for the provision of open access to valuable data sources such as blood banks and paired samples of acute and convalescent sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to validate these. Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data. These data will be critical to the proper assessment of the effects of social distancing and other measures currently being adopted to slow down the case incidence and for informing future policy direction.","Lourenco, J.; Paton, R.; Ghafari, M.; Kraemer, M.; Thompson, C.; Simmonds, P.; Klenerman, P.; Gupta, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042291v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042291v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True
934,"COVID-19 infection induces readily detectable morphological and inflammation-related phenotypic changes in peripheral blood monocytes, the severity of which correlate with patient outcome","Background: Excessive monocyte/macrophage activation with the development of a cytokine storm and subsequent acute lung injury, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a feared consequence of infection with COVID-19. The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility. Methods: We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome. Findings: While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high). On more detailed analysis, these FSC-high monocytes are CD11b+, CD14+, CD16+, CD68+, CD80+, CD163+, CD206+ and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, consistent with an inflammatory phenotype. Conclusions: The detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation.","Zhang, D.; Guo, R.; Lei, L.; Liu, H.; Wang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Dai, T.; Zhang, T.; Lai, Y.; Wang, J.; Liu, Z.; He, A.; O'Dwyer, M.; Hu, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042655v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True

936,Viral Kinetics and Antibody Responses in Patients with COVID-19,"Background A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading over the world. However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and stools, respectively. Only 13 urines (5.6%) and 12 plasmas (5.7%) were viral positive. Prolonged viral shedding was observed in severe patients than that of non-severe patients. Cough but not fever, aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory specimens, meanwhile the positive stool-RNA appeared to align with the proportion who concurrently had cough and sputum production, but not diarrhea. Typical coronaviral particles could be found directly in sputum by TEM. The anti-nucleocapsid-protein IgM started on day 7 and positive rate peaked on day 28, while that of IgG was on day 10 and day 49 after illness onset. IgM and IgG appear earlier, and their titers are significantly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients (p<0.05). The weak responders for IgG had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than that of strong responders (p= 0.011). Conclusions Nasopharyngeal, sputum and stools rather than blood and urine, were the major shedding routes for SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile sputum had a prolonged viral shedding. Symptom cough seems to be aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory and fecal specimens. Stronger antibody response was associated with delayed viral clearance and disease severity.","Tan, W.; Lu, Y.; Zhang, J.; Wang, J.; Dan, Y.; Tan, Z.; He, X.; Qian, C.; Sun, Q.; Hu, Q.; Liu, H.; Ye, S.; Xiang, X.; Zhou, Y.; Zhang, W.; Guo, Y.; Wang, X.-H.; He, W.; Wan, X.; Sun, F.; Wei, Q.; Chen, C.; Pan, G.; Xia, J.; Mao, Q.; Chen, Y.; Deng, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True
937,Modes of contact and risk of transmission in COVID-19 among close contacts,"Background Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Guangzhou and elsewhere in China. Modes of contact and risk of transmission among close contacts have not been well estimated. Methods We included 4950 closes contacts from Guangzhou, and extracted data including modes of contact, laboratory testing, clinical characteristics of confirmed cases and source cases. We used logistic regression analysis to explore the risk factors associated with infection of close contacts. Results Among 4950 closes contacts, the median age was 38.0 years, and males accounted for 50.2% (2484). During quarantine period, 129 cases (2.6%) were diagnosed, with 8 asymptomatic (6.2%), 49 mild (38.0%), and 5 (3.9%) severe to critical cases. The sensitivity of throat swab was 71.32% and 92.19% at first to second PCR test. Among different modes of contact, household contacts were the most dangerous in catching with infection of COVID-19, with an incidence of 10.2%. As the increase of age for close contacts and severity of source cases, the incidence of COVID-19 presented an increasing trend from 1.8% (0-17 years) to 4.2% (60 or over years), and from 0.33% for asymptomatic, 3.3% for mild, to 6.2% for severe and critical source cases, respectively. Manifestation of expectoration in source cases was also highly associated with an increased risk of infection in their close contacts (13.6%). Secondary cases were in general clinically milder and were less likely to have common symptoms than those of source cases. Conclusions In conclusion, the proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections account for almost half of the confirmed cases among close contacts. The household contacts were the main transmission mode, and clinically more severe cases were more likely to pass the infection to their close contacts. Generally, the secondary cases were clinically milder than those of source cases.","Luo, L.; Liu, D.; Liao, X.-l.; Wu, X.-b.; Jing, Q.-l.; Zheng, J.-z.; Liu, F.-h.; Yang, S.-g.; Bi, B.; Li, Z.-h.; Liu, J.-p.; Song, W.-q.; Zhu, W.; Wang, Z.-h.; Zhang, X.-r.; Chen, P.-l.; Liu, H.-m.; Cheng, X.; Cai, M.-c.; Huang, Q.-m.; Yang, P.; Yang, X.-f.; Huang, Z.-g.; Tang, J.-l.; Ma, Y.; Mao, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042606v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042606v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True

It was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this disease. Up to this date, no comprehensive systematic review for the clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic and mortality findings has been published. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis for a better understanding of COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. Publication bias was assessed and p <0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias. Results: Out of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 4789 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5 to 87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6 to 71.2) and myalgia/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7 to 24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9 %, CI 6.0 to 23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0% (CI 54.3 to 84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0 to 62.4) were the most common findings. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1 to 78.0) was the most common CT-Scan presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01). Conclusion: COVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory findings.

We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (1). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.","Nguyen, A.; David, J. K.; Maden, S. K.; Wood, M.

This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID-19 and its clinical significance. Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P<0.001).

Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chronic diseases, and the proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). Twenty-three (34.3%) patients were still at the anticancer treatment phase, but no tumour progression and recurrence was observed for all the patients during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and/or cough (n=50, 74.6%). Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) with COVID-19 was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095). Limitation: This is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from four hospitals. And some specific clinical information was insufficient. Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive attentions to cancer patients infected with COVID-19.","Zhang, H.-Y.; Wang, L.-W.; Chen, Y.-Y.; Shen, X.-K.; Wang, Q.; Yan, Y.-Q.; Yu, Y.; Wu, Q.; Wang, X.; Zhong, Y.-H.; Chua Lee Kiang, M.; Xie, C.-H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20037127v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20037127v1?rss=1,2020-03-26,2020-03-26,,True
942,The potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor,"Outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and has rapidly spread to almost all parts of world. In coronaviruses, the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the distal part of S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can directly bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). RBD promote viral entry into the host cells and is an important therapeutic target. In this study, we discovered that theaflavin showed the lower idock score (idock score: -7.95 kcal/mol). To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin showed FullFitness score of -991.21 kcal/mol and estimated {Delta}G of -8.53 kcal/mol for the most favorable interaction with contact area of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by SwissDock service. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were formed between theaflavin and Arg454, Phe456, Asn460, Cys480, Gln493, Asn501 and Val503 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, near the direct contact area with ACE2.

943,An artificial intelligence based first-line defence against COVID-19: digitally screeningcitizens for risks via a chatbot,"To combat the pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), numerous governments have established phone hotlines to prescreen potential cases. These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptomas accuracy far exceeds that of simple ""yes-no"" questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20,000 other diseases. Furthermore, Symptoma allows free text input, furthered with disease-specific follow up questions, in 36 languages. Combined, these results and accessibility give Symptoma the potential to be a key tool in the global fight against COVID-19.

944,Comorbid Diabetes Mellitus was Associated with Poorer Prognosis in Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and was characterized as pandemic by the World Health Organization. Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not been reported yet. Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The cases were confirmed by real-time PCR and the demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was defined as hospitalization, discharged survivor and death, which was followed up until March 12, 2020. Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. No significant differences in age and sex were identified between patients with and without diabetes. Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease condition with more complications at presentation, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%). Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality of COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions Diabetes mellitus is associated with greater disease severity and a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19.

After implementing varying intensities and timing of social distancing measures, several appear to be converging onto the decline in the daily growth rate of deaths, or relative second derivative of total deaths, seen in China after the implementation an aggressive social distancing policy. By calculating future trajectories in these countries based on the observed Chinese fatality statistics, an estimate of the total deaths and maximum daily death rates over a defined period of time is made. Our lower bound estimate for the United Kingdom based on the real data approximates the lower bound estimate of the recent modelling study of Ferguson et al. [1].

947,scRNA-seq reveals ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in TROP2+ Liver Progenitor Cells: Implications in COVID-19 associated Liver Dysfunction,"The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 was first reported in China (December 2019) and now prevalent in [~]170 countries across the globe. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into mammalian cells require the binding of viral Spike (S) proteins to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor. Once entered the S protein is primed by a specialised serine protease, TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2) in the host cell. Importantly, beside respiratory symptoms, consistent with other common respiratory virus infection when patients become viraemic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities. We explored if specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver, could be implicated in disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine storms. Here we employed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to survey the human liver and identified potentially implicated liver cell-type for viral ingress. We report the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a TROP2+ liver progenitor population. Importantly, we fail to detect the expression of ACE2 in hepatocyte or any other liver (immune and stromal) cell types. These results indicated that in COVID-19 associated liver dysfunction and cell death, viral infection of TROP2+ progenitors in liver may significantly impaired liver regeneration and could lead to pathology.

948,Potent human neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The pandemic caused by emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents a serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.","Ju, B.; Zhang, Q.; Ge, X.; Wang, R.; Yu, J.; Shan, S.; Zhou, B.; Song, S.; Tang, X.; Yu, J.; Ge, J.; Lan, J.; Yuan, J.; Wang, H.; Zhao, J.; Zhang, S.; Wang, Y.; Shi, X.; Liu, L.; Wang, X.; Zhang, Z.; Zhang, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.990770v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.990770v1?rss=1,2020-03-25,2020-03-25,,False

Therefore, in the middle of the pandemic, all kind of knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 may help us to find the solution. Determining the 3D structures of the proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions are of great importance in the fight against infection. Besides, post-translational modifications of the protein on 3D structure should be revealed in order to understand the protein function since these modifications are responsible for the host-pathogen interaction. Based on these, we predicted O-glycosylation and phosphorylation positions using full amino acid sequence of S1 protein. Candidate positions were further analyzed with enzyme binding activity, solvent accessibility, surface area parameters and the positions determined with high accuracy rate were used to design full 3D glycoprotein structure of the S1 protein using carbohydrate force field. In addition, the interaction between the C-type lectin CD209L and -mannose residues was examined and carbohydrate recognition positions were predicted. We suggest these positions as a potential target for the inhibition of the initial binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein to the host cell.","Uslupehlivan, M.; Sener, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.007898v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.007898v1?rss=1,2020-03-25,2020-03-25,,False
950,Analysis of Serologic Cross-Reactivity Between Common Human Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 Using Coronavirus Antigen Microarray,"The current practice for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on PCR testing of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk. This testing strategy likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection, creating the need for serologic methods to detect infections missed by the limited testing to date. Here, we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates overall high IgG reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low IgG reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, with some cross-reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including S2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. This array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, including whether baseline serology for other coronaviruses impacts disease course, how the antibody response to infection develops over time, and what antigens would be optimal for vaccine development.","Khan, S.; Nakajima, R.; Jain, A.; de Assis, R.

There are no specific drugs or vaccines against COVID-19, thus effective antiviral agents are still urgently needed to combat this virus. Herein, the FEP (free energy perturbation)-based screening strategy is newly derived as a rapid protocol to accurately reposition potential agents against COVID-19 by targeting viral proteinase Mpro. Restrain energy distribution (RED) function was derived to optimize the alchemical pathway of FEP, which greatly accelerated the calculations and first made FEP possible in the virtual screening of the FDA-approved drugs database. As a result, fifteen out of twenty-five drugs validated in vitro exhibited considerable inhibitory potencies towards Mpro. Among them, the most potent Mpro inhibitor dipyridamole potentially inhibited NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway and inflammatory responses, and has just finished the first round clinical trials.

However, there is no clinical evidence about whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect male gonadal function so far. In this study, we compared the sex-related hormones between 81 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 100 age-matched healthy men, and found that serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was significantly increased, but the ratio of testosterone (T) to LH and the ratio of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to LH were dramatically decreased in males with COVID-19. Besides, multivariable regression analysis indicated that c-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly associated with serum T:LH ratio in COVID-19 patients. This study provides the first direct evidence about the influence of medical condition of COVID-19 on male sex hormones, alerting more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.","Ma, L.; Xie, W.; Li, D.; Shi, L.; Mao, Y.; Xiong, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20037267v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20037267v1?rss=1,2020-03-24,2020-03-24,,True
953,"SARS-CoV-2 launches a unique transcriptional signature from in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo systems","One of the greatest threats to humanity is the emergence of a pandemic virus. Among those with the greatest potential for such an event include influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of COVID-19.","Blanco-Melo, D.; Nilsson-Payant, B.; Liu, W.-C.; Moeller, R.; Panis, M.; Sachs, D.; Albrecht, R.; tenOever, B.

954,Characterisation of the transcriptome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using direct RNA sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry reveals evidence for a cell passage induced in-frame deletion in the spike glycoprotein that removes the furin-like cleavage site.,"Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples.

It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: All patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245. Findings:17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.006) and case severity (p=0.021) in critical and severe patients. The time to virus negative in meplazumab group was reduced than that in control group (median 3, 95%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.014, HR=0.37, 95%CI[0.155-0.833]).

956,Mechanistic-statistical SIR modelling for early estimation of the actual number of cases and mortality rate from COVID-19,"The first cases of COVID-19 in France were detected on January 24, 2020. The number of screening tests carried out and the methodology used to target the patients tested do not allow for a direct computation of the actual number of cases and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). We develop a 'mechanistic-statistical' approach coupling a SIR ODE model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method. The objective of this model is not to make forecasts but to estimate the actual number of people infected with COVID-19 during the observation window in France and to deduce the IFR associated with the epidemic in France. Main results. The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor x5 (95%-CI: 3.5-7.8) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5% (95%-CI: 0.3-0.8). Although accurate in France, the SIR model cannot capture the decline in the number of cases observed in South Korea: this points out the strong impact on the epidemic dynamics of the management strategy adopted in South Korea.","Roques, L.; Klein, E.; Papaix, J.; Soubeyrand, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040915v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040915v1?rss=1,2020-03-24,2020-03-24,,True
957,Epidemiological parameters of coronavirus disease 2019: a pooled analysis of publicly reported individual data of 1155 cases from seven countries,"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, while several key epidemiological parameters of the disease remain to be clarified. This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19. Methods Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI. To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (< 0.3 day). Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented. Findings In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Malaysia were included for the final analysis. The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before symptom onset of infector) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before the symptom onsets of infectors. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, symptom onsets of infectees occurred before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed. Interpretation This study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.","Ma, S.; Zhang, J.; Zeng, M.; Yun, Q.; Guo, W.; Zheng, Y.; Zhao, S.; Wang, M.

958,"Myocardial injury is associated with in-hospital mortality of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A single center retrospective cohort study","[Background] Since December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread rapidly from China to other countries. In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce. [Objectives] To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. [Methods] Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th February, 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. [Results] A total of 110 patients with confirmed (n=80) or suspected (n=30) COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients (female 31.3%, mean age 70.58{+/-}13.38 year old) among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 (17/48, 35.4%) died in hospital while 31 (31/48, 64.6%) were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 (13/48, 27.1%) patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation (SpO2) on admission (HR 0.704, 95% CI 0.546-0.909, per 1% decrease, p=0.007), elevated hs-cTnI (HR 10.902, 95% 1.279-92.927, p=0.029) and elevated d-dimer (HR 1.103, 95%CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg/L increase, p=0.003) on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. [Conclusions] Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.","Zhang, F.; Yang, D.; Li, J.; Gao, P.; Chen, T.; Cheng, Z.; Cheng, K.; Fang, Q.; Pan, W.; Yi, C.; Fan, H.; Wu, Y.; Li, L.; Fang, Y.; Liu, J.; Tian, G.; He, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040121v1?rss=1,2020-03-24,2020-03-24,,True
959,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is straining healthcare resources worldwide, prompting social distancing measures to reduce transmission intensity. The amount of social distancing needed to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the context of seasonally varying transmission remains unclear. Using a mathematical model, we assessed that one-time interventions will be insufficient to maintain COVID-19 prevalence within the critical care capacity of the United States. Seasonal variation in transmission will facilitate epidemic control during the summer months but could lead to an intense resurgence in the autumn. Intermittent distancing measures can maintain control of the epidemic, but without other interventions, these measures may be necessary into 2022. Increasing critical care capacity could reduce the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic while ensuring that critically ill patients receive appropriate care.","Kissler, S.

960,Window of Opportunity for Mitigation to Prevent Overflow of ICU capacity in Chicago by COVID-19,"We estimate the growth in demand for ICU beds in Chicago during the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, using state-of-the-art computer simulations calibrated for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The questions we address are these: (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much? (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity? (3) When should such strategies be implemented? Our answers are as follows: (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten. (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late. (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion that it exists and will soon be closed. Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation/lockdown implemented in the next week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and then strong mitigation/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too late.","Maslov, S.; Goldenfeld, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20040048v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20040048v1?rss=1,2020-03-24,2020-03-24,,True
961,Hypertension and Diabetes Delay the Viral Clearance in COVID-19 Patients,"Objectives: Comorbidities have significant indications for the disease outcome of COVID-19, however which underlying diseases that contribute the most to aggravate the conditions of COVID-19 patients is still largely unknown. SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is a golden standard for defining the recovery of COVID-19 infections. To dissect the underlying diseases that could impact on viral clearance, we enrolled 106 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China between Jan 5 and Feb 25, 2020. Methodology: We comprehensively analyzed demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as patient treatment records. Survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modelling were employed to identify factors influencing the viral clearance negatively. Results: We found that increasing age, male gender, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) associated factors (including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases) adversely affected the viral clearance. Furthermore, analysis by a random forest survival model pointed out hypertension, cortisone treatment, gender, and age as the four most important variables. Conclusions: We conclude that patients at old age, males, and/or having diseases associated with high expression of ACE2 will have worse prognosis during a COVID-19 infections.","Chen, X.; Hu, W.; Ling, J.; Mo, P.; Zhang, Y.; Jiang, Q.; Ma, Z.; Cao, Q.; Deng, L.; Song, S.; Zheng, R.; Gao, S.; Ke, H.; Gui, X.; Lundkvist, A.; Li, J.; Lindahl, J.

However, seldom study focused on confirmed and unconfirmed groups. Our aim was to compare clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside Hubei province between confirmed and unconfirmed group. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 163 consecutive adult patients with suspected COVID-19 from three tertiary hospitals in two provinces outside Hubei province from January 12, 2020 to February 13, 2020 and the differences in epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics between the two groups were compared. Results This study enrolled 163 patients with 62 confirmed cases and 101 unconfirmed cases. Most confirmed patients were clustered (31, 50.0%) and with definite epidemiological exposure. Symptoms of COVID-19 were nonspecific, largely fever and dry cough. Laboratory findings in confirmed group were characterized by normal or reduced white blood cell count, reduced the absolute value of lymphocytes, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and accelerated Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The typical chest CT imaging features of patients with confirmed COVID-19 were peripherally distributed multifocal GGO with predominance in the lower lung lobe. Compared with unconfirmed patients, confirmed patients had significantly higher proportion of dry cough, leucopenia, lymphopenia and accelerated ESR (P<0.05); but not with alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, and myoglobin (P>0.05). Proportion of peripheral, bilateral or lower lung distribution and multi-lobe involvement, GGO, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram and pleural thickening in the confirmed group were also higher (P<0.05).

965,Tracking and forecasting milepost moments of the epidemic in the early-outbreak: framework and applications to the COVID-19,"Background. The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. Intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two ``zero"" points, respectively. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak. Method. To address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. Specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two ``zero"" points. Then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. Finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the COVID-19 using the public available data for mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Results. Results show that our model can clearly outline the development of the epidemic at a very early stage. The first prediction results on Jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments for mainland China beyond Hubei Province would appear on Jan 31st and Feb 14th respectively, which are only one day and three days behind the real world situations. Forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-late March, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-March and mid-April in mainland China beyond Hubei Province. The framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where COVID-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future.","Wang, H.; Zhang, Y.; Lu, S.; Wang, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040139v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040139v1?rss=1,2020-03-24,2020-03-24,,True
966,Infection Control of 2019 Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in Cancer Patients undergoing Radiotherapy in Wuhan,"Background A pandemic of 2019 novel corona virus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan city, has affected more than 100,000 patients worldwide. Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of COVID-19, but currently, there is no guidance on the management of cancer patients during this outbreak. Here, we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan. Methods We reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. This preceded the city lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented, which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases, on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5th edition criteria. Findings 209 patients completed RT during the study period. Median age was 55 y (IQR = 48-64). Thoracic, head and neck, and lower gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancer patients consisted the majority of patients. Treatment sites included thoracic (38.3%), head and neck (25.4%), and abdomen and pelvis (25.8%); 47.4%, 27.3%, and 25.4% of treatments were for adjuvant, radical, and palliative indications, respectively. 188 treatments/day were performed prior to the lock-down, in contrast to 12.4 treatments/day post-lock-down. Only one (0.48%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. No healthcare worker was infected. Interpretation Herein, we show that in a susceptible population to COVID-19, strict infection control measures can curb human-to-human transmission, and ensure timely delivery of RT to cancer patients.","Xie, C.; Wang, X.; Liu, H.; Bao, Z.; Yu, J.; Zhong, Y.; Chua, M.

967,First Clinical Study Using HCV Protease Inhibitor Danoprevir to Treat Naive and Experienced COVID-19 Patients,"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in China in January, 2020, repurposing approved drugs is emerging as important therapeutic options. We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naive and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day).

969,Characterizing occupations that cannot work from home: a means to identify susceptible worker groups during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Introduction As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads globally, public health guidance is advising all workers to work from home. However, not all workers are employed in occupations which can be done from home. These workers are at an increased risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2due to increased interaction with the public and other workers, and also potentially at an increased risk for job displacement as more extreme public health measures (such as closing of retail operations or enforcing shelter in place) occur. Methods To characterize the occupations least likely to be able to work from home, national employment and wage data maintained by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with measures from the BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations by a variety of physical, ergonomic, psychosocial, and structural exposures. Noting that the work that could most easily be done at home would be work done on a computer that does not rely on interaction with the public, O*NET measures quantifying the importance of computer use at work, and the importance of working with or performing for the public at work were utilized. Results From this analysis, 19.5% (28.2 M) of the United States workforce covered by O*NET are employed in occupations where working from home would be difficult, due to minimal use of computer at work, and a high level of interaction with the public. These workers tend to be in service occupations, including retail and food service, protective service occupations, and transportation occupations such as bus drivers. About 25% (35.6 M) of the United States workforce covered by O*NET are employed in occupations where working from home could likely be more easily accommodated, as these workers do much of their work on computers and interaction with the public is not important. These workers tend to be in technology, computer, management, administrative, financial, engineering, and some science occupations, which typically have higher pay than occupations which cannot be done at home. Conclusions The workers in occupations that have minimal computer use, and high interaction with the public are least likely to be able to work from home during a public health emergency. These workers could also be at an increased risk for job displacement if public-facing establishments close or alter their business model in the face of increased public health restrictions. Occupations where working from home is not possible tend to have lower annual median incomes than occupations where working from home is possible, increasing the vulnerability of these workers. Characterizing which occupational groups are least likely to be able to work from home can inform public health risk management and prioritize occupational sectors where additional workplace protections are necessary.","Baker, M.

970,Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults,"RAPID COMMUNICATION 22 March 2020 Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults Background: The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged [&ge;]30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. Findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged [&le;]70 years with [&ge;]1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of [&ge;]2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with [&ge;]3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 80% in the UK population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. Interpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.","Banerjee, A.; Pasea, L.; Harris, S.; Gonzalez-Izquierdo, A.; Torralbo, A.; Shallcross, L.; Noursadeghi, M.; Pillay, D.; Pagel, C.; Wong, W.

The present study aimed to exam sleep problems and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese immediately after the massive outbreak of COVID-19. A total of 2027 Chinese participated in the present study. Wuhan-expose history, sleep quality and PTSS were measured with self-rating scales. Results showed that there were significant differences of PCL-5 and of sleep quality scores in different data-collection dates (ps<0.05). There were significant differences of PCL-5 scores (p<0.05) and latency onset of sleep (p<0.05) between participants with and without Wuhan-expose history. The interaction effect of Wuhan exposure history x sleep quality significantly influenced PCL-5 (ps<0.05). These results indicate that keeping good sleep quality in individuals with high infectious risk is a way to prevent PTSS.","Zhang, F.; Shang, Z.; Ma, H.; Jia, Y.; Sun, L.; Guo, X.; Wu, L.; Sun, Z.; Zhou, Y.; Wang, Y.; Liu, N.; Liu, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20034504v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20034504v1?rss=1,2020-03-24,2020-03-24,,True
972,Analysis of psychological state and clinical psychological intervention model of patients with COVID-19,"Background:Patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have different degrees of psychological pain, such as anxiety and depression, which may related to their prognosis. Psychological intervention can be conducted in different ways to improve psychological pain and improve the treatment effect. Objective:The present study aimed to investigate and analyze the psychological status of patients with COVID-19 during the course of illness, and to evaluate the effect and influencing factors of psychological crisis intervention, so as to explore the effective mode of clinical psychological intervention in acute patients under isolation environment. Methods:A total of 143 persons participated in the study, including 26 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward (COVID-19 group), 87 patients with general pneumonia in the observation ward (General Pneumonia group) and 30 healthy volunteers (Normal group). All the patients in the ward received comprehensive psychological intervention, including telephone psychological counseling (active and passive), self-adjustment of written materials and one-to-one psychological crisis intervention. Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate the mental health status of all patients on the day of admission and 1 week after treatment. Results:The scores of HAMA and HAMD of all patients (including isolation ward and observation ward) were significantly higher than the healthy volunteers at the time of admission. The total score of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID-19 group were both higher than that General Pneumonia group. After 1 week`s hospitalization with comprehensive psychological intervention, the scores of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID-19 group were significantly decreased. Conclusion:Patients those who diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward and/or general pneumonia in observation ward have different degrees of anxiety, depression and sleep problems. While receiving antiviral treatment, patients also need psychological intervention. Comprehensive psychological intervention model has been proved to be effective.","Yang, L.; Wu, D.; Hou, Y.; Wang, X.; Dai, N.; Wang, G.; Yang, Q.; Zhao, W.; Lou, Z.; Ji, Y.; Ruan, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040899v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040899v1?rss=1,2020-03-24,2020-03-24,,True
973,The impact of temperature and absolute humidity on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak - evidence from China,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the impact of temperature and absolute humidity on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. DESIGN Ecological study. SETTING 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Data on COVID-19 incidence and climate between Jan 20 and Feb 29, 2020. RESULTS The number of new confirm COVID-19 cases in mainland China peaked on Feb 1, 2020. COVID-19 daily incidence were lowest at -10  and highest at 10 ,while the maximum incidence was observed at the absolute humidity of approximately 7 g/m3. COVID-19 incidence changed with temperature as daily incidence decreased when the temperature rose. No significant association between COVID-19 incidence and absolute humidity was observed in distributed lag nonlinear models. Additionally, A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale. CONCLUSION Temperature is an environmental driver of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Lower and higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence. M-SEIR models help to better evaluate environmental and social impacts on COVID-19.","Shi, P.; Dong, Y.; Yan, H.; Li, X.; Zhao, C.; Liu, W.; He, M.; Tang, S.; Xi, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20038919v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20038919v1?rss=1,2020-03-24,2020-03-24,,True
974,"High incidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, Chongqing, China","Background: SARS-CoV-2 has been a global pandemic, but the emergence of asymptomatic patients has caused difficulties in the prevention of the epidemic. Therefore, it is significant to understand the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective and observational study, we collected data from 167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (Chongqing, China) from January to March 2020. The epidemiological characteristics and variable of these patients were collected and analyzed. Findings: 82.04% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had a travel history in Wuhan or a history of contact with returnees from Wuhan, showing typical characteristics of imported cases, and the proportion of severe Covid-19 patients was 13.2%, of which 59% were imported from Wuhan. For the patients who was returnees from Wuhan, 18.1% was asymptomatic patients. In different infection periods, compared with the proportion after 1/31/2020, the proportion of asymptomatic patient among SARS-CoV-2 infected patient was higher(19% VS 1.5%). In different age groups, the proportion of asymptomatic patient was the highest(28.6%) in children group under 14, next in elder group over 70 (27.3%). Compared with mild and common Covid-19 patients, the mean latency of asymptomatic was longer (11.25 days VS 8.86 days), but the hospital length of stay was shorter (14.3 days VS 16.96 days) . Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 prevention needs to focus on the screening of asymptomatic patients in the community with a history of contact with the imported population, especially for children and the elderly population.","Tao, Y.; Cheng, P.; Chen, W.; Wan, P.; Chen, Y.; Yuan, G.; Chen, J.; Huo, D.; Guan, G.; Sun, D.; Tan, J.; Yang, G.; Zeng, W.; Zhu, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037259v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037259v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True
975,High COVID-19 incidence among Norwegian travellers returned from Lombardy: implications for travel restrictions,"On February 27th, three cases of COVID-19 were reported among Norwegians that had recently returned from Lombardy, Italy. Travellers from the region rapidly became the most common source of imported infections in the earliest stage of the Norwegian COVID-19 epidemic. The situation was exacerbated by the unfortunate temporal overlap between the Norwegian winter holidays and intense epidemic spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy, resulting in a large number of infected travellers. Here we combined flight data on travels between Norway and Lombardy with patient-level data to determine the fraction of travellers returning to Norway that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Travellers returning to Norway from Lombardy contracted COVID-19 at incidence rates up to 0.02 per person-day in the period spanning February 21st and March 1st, with a clear uptick in transmission in the middle of the period. This shows an example of the infection risk in tourist destinations being several fold higher than elsewhere in the region. In Norway, this is also supported by high rates of infections among tourists returning from Austria in February and March, despite a low number of reported cases in the country at the time. The massive COVID-19 prevalence among travellers suggest that mandatory quarantine of returning travellers or suspension of non-essential international flights is essential if the aim is to control or suppress the COVID-19 pandemic.","Brynildsrud, O.; Eldholm, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038406v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038406v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True
976,Chinese and Italian COVID-19 outbreaks can be correctly described by a modified SIRD model,"The COVID-19 disease is rapidly spreading in whole globe, affecting millions of people and pushing governments to take drastic measures to contain the outbreaks. The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted. With this approach the lack of data due to the still ongoing Italian epidemic was compensated by the Chinese experience, allowing to obtain a SIRD model for this relatively new COVID-19 outbreak. According to the modeling prediction the peak of infection should be on the 28th of March, with almost 42,000 infected people.","Caccavo, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039388v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039388v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True
977,Forecasting ultra-early intensive care strain from COVID-19 in England,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented strain on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in parts of the world. Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions. At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is designed to be parsimonious and based on plausible epidemiological data from the literature available. On the basis of the modelling assumptions made, ICU occupancy is likely to increase dramatically in the the days following the time of modelling. If the current exponential growth continues, 5 out of 7 commissioning regions will have more critically ill COVID-19 patients than there are ICU beds within two weekstodo{last thing to do}. Despite variable growth in absolute patients, all commissioning regions are forecast to be heavily burdened under the assumptions used. Whilst, like any forecast model, there remain uncertainties both in terms of model specification and robust epidemiological data in this early prospective phase, it would seem that surge capacity will be required in the very near future. We hope that our model will help policy decision makers with their preparations. The uncertainties in the data highlight the urgent need for ongoing real-time surveillance to allow forecasts to be constantly updated using high quality local patient-facing data as it emerges.","Deasy, J.; Rocheteau, E.; Kohler, K.; Stubbs, D.

978,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"Background The novel coronavirus COVID19 has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic due to its worldwide spread. The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system. Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in cases, the magnitude of the epidemic peak, and the outbreak duration were obtained. Findings The application of all four social distancing interventions: school closure, workplace non-attendance, increased case isolation, and community contact reduction is highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve, reducing the maximum daily case numbers, and lengthening outbreak duration. These were also found to be effective even after 10 weeks delay from index case arrivals. The most effective single intervention was found to be increasing case isolation, to 100 percent of children and 90 percent of adults. Interpretation As strong social distancing intervention strategies had the most effect in reducing the epidemic peak, this strategy may be considered when weaker strategies are first tried and found to be less effective. Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society. Tradeoffs may need to be made between the effectiveness of social distancing strategies and population willingness to adhere to them.","Milne, G.

979,Potential biochemical markers to identify severe cases among COVID-19 patients,"There is a high mortality and long hospitalization period for severe cases with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. Therefore, it makes sense to search for a potential biomarker that could rapidly and effectively identify severe cases early. Clinical samples from 28 cases of COVID-19 (8 severe cases, 20 mild cases) in Zunyi District from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were collected and otherwise statistically analysed for biochemical markers. Serum urea, creatinine (CREA) and cystatin C (CysC) concentrations in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.001), and there were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). Serum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including urea, CREA, CysC, which reflect glomerular filtration function, may have some significance as potential indicators for the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and to distinguish it from mild COVID-19. Glomerular filtration function injury in severe COVID-19 patients should also be considered by clinicians.","XIANG, J.; WEN, J.; YUAN, X.; Xiong, S.; ZHOU, X.; LIU, C.; MIN, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20034447v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20034447v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True
980,"Role of meteorological temperature and relative humidity in the January-February 2020 propagation of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China","Identified in December 2019, the 2019-nCoV emerged in Wuhan, China, and its spread increased rapidly, with cases arising across Mainland China and several other countries. By January 2020, the potential risks imposed by 2019-nCoV in human health and economical activity were promptly highlighted. Considerable efforts have been devoted for understanding the transmission mechanisms aimed to pursue public policies oriented to mitigate the number of infected and deaths. An important question requiring some attention is the role of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and humidity) in the 2019-nCoV transmission. Correlations between meteorological temperature and relative humidity with the number of daily confirmed cases were explored in this work for the epicenter city of Wuhan, China for the period from 29 January to March 6, 2020. Long-term trend of temperature and relative humidity was obtained with a 14-days adjacent-averaging filter, and lagged correlations of the number of daily confirmed cases were explored. The analysis showed negative correlations between temperatures with the number of daily confirmed cases. Maximum correlations were found for 6-day lagged temperatures, which is likely reflecting the incubation period of the virus. It was postulated that the indoor crowding effect is responsible of the high incidence of 2019-nCoV cases, where low absolute humidity and close human contact facilitate the transport of aerosol droplets.","Alvarez-Ramirez, J.; MERAZ, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039164v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039164v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True
981,Covid-19 health care demand and mortality in Sweden in response to non-pharmaceutical (NPIs) mitigation and suppression scenarios,"Background: While the COVID-19 outbreak in China now appears contained, Europe has become the epicenter, with both Italy and Spain reporting more deaths than China. Here we analyse the potential consequences of different response strategies to COVID-19 within Sweden, the resulting demand for care, critical care, deaths and their associated direct health care related costs. Methods: We use an age stratified health-care demand extended SEIR compartmental model fitted to the municipality level for all municipalities in Sweden, and a radiation model describing inter-municipality mobility. Results: Our models fit well with the observed deaths in Sweden up to 25th of March. The critical care demand is estimated to peak just above 16,000 patients per day by early May in the unmitigated scenario, while isolation of elderly and intermediate social distancing can reduce it to around 5000-9000 per day peaking in June. These peaks exceed the normal critical care capacity in Sweden at 526 beds by an order of magnitude. We find, however, that by employing strong social distancing and isolation of families with confirmed cases, as guided by testing, the outbreak can be suppressed to levels below the normal critical care capacity. We estimate death rates in COVID-19 are closely related to the different response strategies. Conclusion: The impact of different combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially the extent of social distancing and isolation, reduce deaths and lower health care costs in Sweden. In most mitigation scenarios, demand on ICU beds would rapidly exceed total ICU capacity, thus calling for immediate expansion of ICU beds. These findings have relevance for Swedish policy and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rocklov, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039594v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039594v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True

In this contribution we analyze the trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in some countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported. Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case.

984,The feasibility of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19 patients: a pilot study,"Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65*109/L vs. 0.76*109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","Duan, K.; Liu, B.; Li, C.; Zhang, H.; Yu, T.; Qu, J.; Zhou, M.; Chen, L.; Meng, S.; Hu, Y.; Peng, C.; Yuan, M.; Huang, J.; Wang, Z.; Yu, J.; Gao, X.; Wang, D.; Yu, X.; Li, L.; Zhang, J.; Wu, X.; Li, B.; Yu, Y.; Chen, W.; Peng, Y.; Hu, Y.; Lin, L.; Liu, X.; Huang, S.; Zhou, Z.; Zhang, L.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Deng, K.; Xia, Z.; Gong, Q.; Zhang, W.; Zheng, X.; Liu, Y.; Yang, H.; Zhou, D.; Yu, D.; Hou, J.; Shi, Z.; Chen, S.; Chen, Z.; Zhang, X.-x.; Yang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True

986,"An exploratory randomized, controlled study on the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol treating adult patients hospitalized with mild/moderate COVID-19 (ELACOI)","Background: Antiviral therapies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic of respiratory illness called COVID-19, are still lacking. Methods: Our study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Findings: This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoints, the average time of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and conversion rates at days 7 and 14, were similar between groups (all P>0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P>0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical(P =0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group. Conclusions: LPV/r or arbidol monotherapy present little benefit for improving the clinical outcome of patients hospitalized with mild/moderate COVID-19 over supportive care.","Li, Y.; Xie, Z.; Lin, W.; Cai, W.; Wen, C.; Guan, Y.; Mo, X.; Wang, J.; Wang, Y.; Peng, P.; Chen, X.; Hong, W.; Xiao, G.; Liu, J.; Zhang, L.; Hu, F.; Li, F.; Li, F.; Zhang, F.; Deng, X.; Li, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038984v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038984v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True

In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hoped artificial intelligence (AI) to help reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. Here, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images to detect COVID-19 pneumonia features. Different from conventional medical AI, we were dealing with an epidemic crisis. Working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and / or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we were able to overcome a series of challenges in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the test dataset, which included a variety of pulmonary diseases. Besides, the system automatically highlighted all lesion regions for faster examination.

988,"SARS-CoV-2, an evolutionary perspective of interaction with human ACE2 reveals undiscovered amino acids necessary for complex stability","The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in more than 200,000 infections and nearly 9,000 deaths globally so far. This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor hACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with coronaviruses recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different coronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of coronavirus infections. We also propose that a glycine residue at the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein can have a critical role in permitting bat variants of the coronaviruses to infect human cells.","Armijos-Jaramillo, V.; Yeager, J.; Muslin, C.; Perez-Castillo, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.001933v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.001933v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,False
989,The local stability of a modified multi-strain SIR model for emerging viral strains,"We study a novel multi-strain SIR epidemic model with selective immunity by vaccination. A newer strain is made to emerge in the population when a preexisting strain has reached equilibrium. We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross-immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain. Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus demonstrates that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available for some of its strains, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability. The reproduction number was also determined for the epidemiological model and found to be consistent with the local stability condition for the disease-free equilibrium.","Fudolig, M.; Howard, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039198v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039198v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True
990,Optimization of Microbiological Laboratory Detection Strategy for Patients in A Designated Hospital Treating Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Anhui Province,"Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is an emerging, highly contagious community acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Highly efficient and accurate microbiological laboratory assay is essential to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection, rule out other pathogens that can cause CAP, and monitor secondary infections. Here, we enrolled and provide microbiological analysis for 129 suspected and 52 transferred confirmed NCP patients hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from Jan 21 to Feb 29, 2020. By analyzing the dual swab samples (sputum and pharyngeal) from 129 suspected patients with realtime RT-PCR, we confirmed 33 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with two co-infection cases with adenovirus or rhinovirus. We also used multiplex PCR to detect 13 common respiratory tract pathogens in 96 non-NCP patients, and found that 30 patients (31.25%) were infected with at least one respiratory tract pathogen that may cause CAP. Further, we performed bacterial and fungal cultures as well as fungal serologic tests and found that there is no secondary bacterial/fungal infections in confirmed NCP patients. Our studies suggest that, during the epidemic of NCP in Anhui province, there was a certain proportion of infection and co-infection of other common pathogens of CAP, and the secondary bacterial and fungal infection is not detectable in NCP patients. In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 detection alone, this optimized strategy combining multiple pathogen detection for identification of NCP and other CAP patients as well as cultures and serologic tests for confirmed patients increases the diagnosis efficiency and facilitates the personalized medication.","Chang, W.; Shi, Y.; Qi, Y.; Liu, J.; Liu, T.; Chen, Z.; Zhang, W.; Wang, M.; Liu, D.; Yin, M.; Xu, J.; Yang, Y.; Zhu, X.; Ge, J.; Zhu, S.; Gao, Y.; Ma, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20039065v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20039065v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True
991,Cross-reaction of sera from COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV assays.,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 shares 74.5% genome identity with SARS-CoV, both exhibiting a similar well conserved structure. Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM & IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the IIFA IgM test was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity. Conclusions: Existing diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. These assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for SARS-CoV-2.","Wan, W.

993,COVID-19: Modelling Local Transmission and Morbidity effects to provide an estimate of overall Relative Healthcare Resource Impact by General Practice Granularity,"Introduction Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Methods Two key factors were analysed which when multiplied together would give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. These factors were case incidence and case morbidity. GP Practice data was used as this provided the most geographically granular source of published public population data. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, % age >16 at fulltime work/education, % age over 60, % BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD 2019, Location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as % self-confident in their own long term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated by applying the international mortality Odds Ratio to the local population relevant age and disease prevalences and then summing and dividing by the equivalent national figure. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. Results The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation with the significance of specific factors moderating over time as the balance between external infection, community transmission and impact of mitigation measures feeds through to the number of cases. It showed that currently Urban, % Working and age >60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative HC impact was wide with 80% of practices falling between 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included it showed that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. Conclusion Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health and social care resources across the country. This model provides a method for predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria and thereby providing a method for targeting limited (and perhaps soon to be scarce) care resources to optimise national, regional and local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Stedman, M.; Lunt, M.; Davies, M.; Gibson, M.; Heald, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039024v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039024v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True

This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19. Method Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years. Results Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hubei Province (10.4%), and the rest of China (7.0%). The case fatality rate for the 1,688 infected Chinese healthcare workers was significantly lower than that for the 29,798 infected patients aged 20 to 59 years 0.3% (5/1,688) vs. 0.65% (193/29,798), respectively. Conclusion The disease severity improved considerably over a short period of time in China. The more severe conditions in Wuhan compared to the rest of the country may be attributable to the draconian lockdown.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 8, 2020 were investigated and the prediction was made until March 29, 2020. Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. Findings: On average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases.

997,"Now-casting the COVID-19 epidemic: The use case of Japan, March 2020","Background Reporting delays in disease surveillance impair the ability to assess the current dynamic of an epidemic. In continuously updated epidemic curves, case numbers for the most recent epidemic week or day usually appear to be lower than the previous, suggesting a decline of the epidemic. In reality, the epidemic curve may still be on the rise, because reporting delay prevents the most recent cases to appear in the case count. In context of the COVID-19 epidemic and for countries planning large international gatherings, such as the Summer Olympic Games in Japan 2020, the ability to assess the actual stage of an epidemic is of outmost importance. Methods We applied now-casting onto COVID-19 data provided by the nCoV-2019 Data Working Group to evaluate the .true count of cases, by taking into account reporting delays occurring between date of symptom onset and date of confirmation. Findings We calculated a decrease of reporting delay, from a median delay of ten days in calendar week four 2020 to six days in calendar week eight, resulting in an overall mean of 4.3 days. The confidence intervals of the now-casting indicated an increase of cases in the last reporting days, while case country in that same time period suggested a decline.

998,Effectiveness and safety of antiviral or antibody treatments for coronavirus,"Background: To identify safe and effective medical countermeasures (e.g., antivirals/antibodies) to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org; additional searches for ongoing trials and unpublished studies were conducted in clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers. Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven retrospective medical record/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most common treatment was ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (n=7). Additional therapies included broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30), steroids (n=39) or various interferons (n=12). No eligible studies examining monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 were identified. One trial found that ribavirin prophylactic treatment statistically significantly reduced risk of MERS infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies. Of the 40 studies reporting mortality rates in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, one cohort study (MERS) and one retrospective study (SARS) found a statistically significant increase in the mortality rate for patients treated with ribavirin. Eighteen studies reported potential drug-related adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin. Conclusion: The current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies for coronavirus is inconclusive and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials or observational studies, preventing any treatment recommendations from being made. However, it is clear that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards ribavirin (41/54 studies), which has not shown conclusive evidence of effectiveness and may cause harmful adverse events so future investigations may consider focusing on other candidates for antiviral therapy.","Rios, P.; Radhakrishnan, A.; Antony, J.; Thomas, S.

999,Covid-19 dynamics in Albania: first estimates and projections,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is one of the biggest challenges healthcare systems worldwide have ever had to face. To curb transmission many countries have adopted social distancing measures and travel restrictions. Estimating the effect of these measures in each context is challenging and requires mathematical models of the transmission dynamics. Projections for the future course of the epidemic strongly rely on model predictions and accurate representation of real-time data as they accumulate. Here I develop an SEIR modeling framework for Covid-19, to evaluate reported cases and fatalities, and to enable forecasting using evidence-based Bayesian parameter estimation. This Bayesian framework offers a tool to parametrize real-time dynamics of Covid-19 cases, and explore the effect of control as it unfolds in any setting. I apply the model to Covid-19 data from Albania, where drastic control measures were put in place already on the day of the first confirmed case. Evaluating the dynamics of reported cases 9-31 March 2020, I estimate parameters and make preliminary projections. Three weeks into the measures, Albanian data already indicate a strong signature of more than 40% transmission reduction, and lend support to a progressively increasing effect of control measures rather than a static one. In the Albanian setting, the model and data match well, projecting the peak of the outbreak may be around 5-15 April, and be contained within 300 active confirmed cases if control continues with the same trend. This framework can be used to understand the quantitative effects of different control measures in real-time, and inform adaptive intervention for success in other settings.","Gjini, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038141v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038141v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True
1000,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","School closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find significant associations between levels of absenteeism and COVID-19 complication factors. We observe from our models that an estimated 98.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures, identifying child care subsidization as a potential solution to help maintain healthcare systems during a pandemic.","Chin, E.

1001,Predicting COVID-19 malignant progression with AI techniques,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic since mid-December 2019, which greatly challenge public medical systems. With limited medical resources, it is a natural strategy, while adopted, to access the severity of patients then determine the treatment priority. However, our work observes the fact that the condition of many mild outpatients quickly worsens in a short time, i.e. deteriorate into severe/critical cases. Hence, it has been crucial to early identify those cases and give timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality. This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with potential malignant progression. Methods: A total of 133 consecutively mild COVID-19 patients at admission who was hospitalized in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 3 to February 13, 2020, were selected in this retrospective IRB-approved study. All mild patients at admission were categorized into groups with or without malignant progression. The clinical and laboratory data at admission, the first CT, and the follow-up CT at severe/critical stage of the two groups were compared with Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and t test. Both traditional logistic regression and deep learning-based methods were used to build the prediction models. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the models. Results: The deep learning-based method significantly outperformed logistic regression (AUC 0.954 vs. 0.893). The deep learning-based method achieved a prediction AUC of 0.938 by combining the clinical data and the CT data, significantly outperforming its counterpart trained with clinical data only by 0.141. By further considering the temporal information of the CT sequence, our model achieved the best AUC of 0.954. The proposed model can be effectively used for finding out the mild patients who are easy to deteriorate into severe/critical cases, so that such patients get timely treatments while alleviating the limitations of medical resources.","Bai, X.; Fang, C.; Zhou, Y.; Bai, S.; Liu, Z.; Chen, Q.; Xu, Y.; Xia, T.; Gong, S.; Xie, X.; Song, D.; Du, R.; Zhou, C.; Chen, C.; Nie, D.; Tu, D.; Zhang, C.; Liu, X.; Qin, L.; Chen, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20037325v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20037325v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True
1002,Screening and managing of suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients: experiences from a tertiary hospital outside Hubei province,"Objectives: To report our experiences screening and managing patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease using a hospital-specific protocol. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting: A 1,200 bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. Participants: 802 adults presenting to hospital with concerns of having COVID-19, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 hospital visitors. Interventions: Screening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols. Results: Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital lab using RT PCR. Forty-five of these 73 people were subsequently excluded based on one negative RT PCR result plus positive results to quick screening tests for flu or other respiratory viruses. The remaining 28 people received a second RT PCR test 24 h later. Three people were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive positive RT PCR tests whilst 25 people were excluded based on two consecutive negative tests. The three COVID-19 confirmed cases received non-critical care. There were no new infections of medical staff or new infections of other hospital inpatients. Conclusions: All three cases were detected as a result of vigilant monitoring of hospital visitors. Whilst screening out-patients presenting to a fever clinic remains important, monitoring visitors must not be overlooked.","Pu, H.; Xu, Y.; Doig, G.

Data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients in an imported cases as model in island outside Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study included all 168 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Hainan province from 22 January 2020 to 13 March 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data. Results: Of 168 patients, 160 have been discharged, 6 have died and 2 remain hospitalized. The median age was 51.0 years and 51.8% were females. 129 (76.8%) patients were imported cases, and 118 (70.2%), 51 (30.4%) and 52 (31%) of patients lived in Wuhan or traveled to Wuhan, had contact with Covid-19 patients, or had contact with Wuhan residents, respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (65.5%), dry cough (48.8%) and expectoration (32.1%). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (60.2%). The elderly people with diabetes, hypertension and CVD are more likely to develop severe cases. Follow-up of 160 discharged patients found that 20 patients (12.5%) had a positive RT-PCR test results of pharyngeal swabs or anal swabs or fecal.

1005,Climatic influences on the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2,"The rapid global spread of the novel, pathogenic, SARS-CoV-2 causing the severe acute respiratory disease COVID-19, becomes a major health problem worldwide and pose the need for international predictive programs. Given the lack of both specific drugs and an efficient preventive vaccine, the expectation that SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate might decrease in temperate regions during summer, dominated the social scene. Here, we attempted a prediction of the worldwide spread of the infections based on climatic data, expressed by 19 bioclimatic variables. The calculated probability maps shown that potential areas of infection follow a shift from the Tropical to Temperate and Mediterranean Bioclimatic regions, and back to the Tropics again. Maps show an increased probability of infections in Europe, followed by an expansion covering areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as Eastern coastal areas of North America, South-Eastern coastal areas of Latin America and two areas of Southern Australia, and later return to areas of Southeastern Asia, in a manner similar to that of influenza strains (H3N2). Our approach may therefore be of value for the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an optimistic scenario of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks, like other viral respiratory diseases. Consequently, we suggest the incorporation of a climatic impact in the design and implementation of public health policies.

1006,A Tempo-geographic Analysis of Global COVID-19 Epidemic Outside of China,"Background: Understanding the global epidemic trends, geographic distribution, and transmission patterns of COVID-19 contribute to providing timely information for the global response of the epidemic. This study aims to understand the global pandemic geospatial patterns and trends and identify new epicenters requiring urgent attention. Methods: Data on COVID-19 between 31st Dec. 2019 and 8th Mar. 2020 was included. The epidemic trend was analyzed using joinpoint regressions; the growth of affected countries was by descriptive analysis; and the global distribution and transmission trend by spatial analysis. Findings: The number of new cases in the regions outside of China slowly increased before 24th Feb. and rapidly accelerated after 24th Feb. Compared to China, other affected countries experienced a longer duration of a slow increase at the early stage and rapid growth at the latter stages. The first apparent increase in the number of affected countries occurred from 23rd Jan to 1st Feb, where most of the first confirmed cases originated from China; the second apparent increase started from 25th Feb., where the majority originated from Italy and Iran. The geographic distribution changed from single-center (13th Jan.-20th Feb.) to multi-centers pattern (20th Feb.-14th Mar.). More countries were affected by COVID-19 and developed local transmission. Interpretation: The joinpoint regression and geospatial analysis indicated a multi-center pandemic of COVID-19.

1008,"Association between Clinical, Laboratory and CT Characteristics and RT-PCR Results in the Follow-up of COVID-19 patients","Abstract Background: Since December 2019, more than 100,000 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been confirmed globally based on positive viral nucleic acids with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the association between clinical, laboratory and CT characteristics and RT-PCR results is still unclear. We sought to examine this association in detail, especially in recovered patients. Methods: We analysed data from 52 confirmed patients who had been discharged with COVID-19. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were dynamically recorded and compared with the admission and follow-up RT-PCR results. Results: In this cohort, 52 admitted COVID-19 patients who had confirmed positive RT-PCR results were discharged after 2 rounds of consecutively negative RT-PCR results. Compared with admission levels, CRP levels (median 4.93 mg/L [IQR: 1.78-10.20]) decreased significantly (p<0.001). and lymphocyte counts (median 1.50x109/L [IQR: 1.11-1.88]) increased obviously after obtaining negative RT-PCR results (p<0.001). Additionally, substantially improved inflammatory exudation was observed on chest CT except for 2 progressed patients. At the two-week follow-up after discharge, 7 patients had re-positive RT-PCR results, including the abovementioned 2 progressed patients. Among the 7 patients, new GGO was demonstrated in 2 patients. There were no significant differences in CPR levels or lymphocyte counts when comparing the negative and re-positive PCT results (all p >0.05). Conclusion: Heterogeneity between CT features and RT-PCR results was found in COVID-19, especially in some recovered patients with negative RT-PCR results. Our study highlights that both RT-PCR and chest CT should be considered as the key determinants for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Fu, H.; Xu, H.; Zhang, N.; Xu, H.; Li, Z.; Chen, H.; Xu, R.; Sun, R.; Wen, L.; Xie, L.; Liu, H.; Zhang, K.; Fu, C.; Hou, K.; Yang, Z.; Yang, M.; Guo, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038315v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038315v1?rss=1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,,True

1010,ACE-2 Expression in the Small Airway Epithelia of Smokers and COPD Patients: Implications for COVID-19,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARSCoV-2). This virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as the cellular entry receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID19, we determined whether ACE2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking. Methods: Using RNAseq, we determined gene expression levels in bronchial epithelia obtained from cytologic brushings of 6th to 8th generation airways in individuals with and without COPD. We externally validated these results from two additional independent cohorts, which used microarray technologies to measure gene expression levels from 6th to 12th generation airways. Results: In the discovery cohort (n=42 participants), we found that ACE2 expression levels were increased by 48% in the airways of COPD compared with non-COPD subjects (COPD=2.52 (0.66) log2 counts per million reads (CPM) versus non-COPD= 1.70 (0.51) CPM , p=.000762). There was a significant inverse relationship between ACE2 gene expression and FEV1% of predicted (r=negative 0.24; p=0.035). Current smoking also significantly increased ACE2 expression levels compared with never smokers (never current smokers=2.77 (90.91) CPM versus smokers=1.78 (0.39) CPM, p=0.024). These findings were replicated in the two external cohorts. Conclusions: ACE2 expression in lower airways is increased in patients with COPD and with current smoking. These data suggest that these two subgroups are at increased risk of serious COVID19 infection and highlight the importance of smoking cessation in reducing the risk.","Leung, J. M.; Yang, C.

1012,From a single host to global spread. The global mobility based modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic implies higher infection and lower detection rates than current estimates.,"Background: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple efforts of modelling of the geo-temporal transmissibility of the virus have been undertaken, but none succeeded in describing the pandemic at the global level. We propose a set of parameters for the first COVID-19 Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEaM). The simulation starting with just a single pre-symptomatic, yet infectious, case in Wuhan, China, results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 125 days in multiple countries across three continents. Methods: We have built a modified SIR model and parameterized it analytically, according to the literature and by fitting the missing parameters to the observed dynamics of the virus spread. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in sixeight selected countries which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken precautions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions fit well to the empirical data. Findings: The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, ~4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Also, the higher the testing rate per country, the lower the discrepancy between data (diagnosed cases) and model. Interpretation: Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.","Siwiak, M.

The number of identified cases afterward increased rapidly and the novel coronavirus spread to all provinces of the country. This study aimed to fit an epidemic model to the reported cases data to estimate the basic reproduction number (R_0) of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: We used data from February 21, 2020, to March 18, 2020, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments and we employed the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) epidemic spreading model to fit the transmission model to the reported cases data by tuning the parameters in order to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Iran. Results: The value of reproduction number was estimated 4.86 in the first week and 4.5 in the second and decreasing from 4.29 to 2.1 in the third and fourth weeks. Conclusions: The results indicate that the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 is significantly larger than one.

Understanding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for deterring future zoonosis and for drug discovery and vaccine development. We show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the spike gene and in other genes among bat, pangolin and human coronaviruses, indicating similar strong evolutionary constraints in different host species. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2s entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2s ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species and frequent recombination among coronaviruses suggest a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.

1016,A SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein-Protein Interaction Map Reveals Drug Targets and Potential Drug-Repurposing,"An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption1,2. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.","Gordon, D.

1017,COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine design using reverse vaccinology and machine learning,"To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets provide new strategies for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development.","Ong, E.; Wong, M.

1018,COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates: Prediction and Validation of 174 SARS-CoV-2 Epitopes,"The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) virus has highlighted the need for fast and efficacious vaccine development. Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 19 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools, and using an in vitro peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with high prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA allotypes. Our findings may contribute to the design of an efficacious vaccine against COVID-19.","Prachar, M.; Justesen, S.; Steen-Jensen, D. B.; Thorgrimsen, S. P.; Jurgons, E.; Winther, O.; Bagger, F.

Despite low viral loads, the mNGS workflow used herein allowed to characterize the whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 isolated from an asymptomatic patient, in 2 clinical samples collected 1 day apart. Comparison of these sequences suggests viral evolution with development of quasispecies. In addition, the present workflow identified a new deletion in nsp2 (Asp268Del) which was found in all 3 samples originating from this cluster as well as in 37 other viruses collected in England and in Netherlands, suggesting the spread of this deletion in Europe.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab followed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has caused a severe bottleneck to COVID-19 testing. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether, and tested this hypothesis on a series of blinded clinical samples. The direct RT-qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of NP samples (n = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Thus, direct RT-qPCR could be a front-line approach to identify the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients, reserving a repeat test with RNA extraction for those individuals with high suspicion of infection but an initial negative result.

We have performed an integrated sequence-based analysis of SARS-CoV2 genomes from different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in SARS-CoV and other related coronavirus family genomes, conferring unique infection, facilitation of transmission, virulence and immunogenic features to the virus. The phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results. Systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the SARS-CoV2 genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C>T)) in the Indian SARS-CoV2, absent in other strains studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host-miRNAs may be controlling the viral pathogenesis. Our analysis reveals nine host miRNAs which can potentially target SARS-CoV2 genes. Interestingly, the nine miRNAs do not have targets in SARS and MERS genomes.

Pulmonary infiltrates, a hallmark of human disease, were visible in lung radiographs of all animals. High viral loads were detected in swabs from the nose and throat of all animals as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one animal we observed prolonged rectal shedding.

1027,"Pandemic dynamics of COVID-19 using epidemic stage, instantaneous reproductive number and pathogen genome identity (GENI) score: modeling molecular epidemiology","Background: Global spread of COVID-19 created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis that progressed to a pandemic with >180,000 cases in >100 countries. Reproductive number (R) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. Initial R values were published based on the early outbreak in China with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. Initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for SARS-Cov-2. Methods: Each country's COVID-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). Instantaneous R estimates (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. Whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. Transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations/month. Findings: The country-specific R revealed variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak stages. Outside China, R estimates revealed propagating epidemics poised to move into the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had variable relationship to the outbreaks. GENI scores differentiated countries in index stage with cryptic transmission. Integration of incidence data with genome variation directly increases in cases with increased genome variation. Interpretation: R was dynamic for each country and during the outbreak stage. Integrating the outbreak dynamic, dynamic R, and genome variation found a direct association between cases and genome variation. Synergistically, GENI provides an evidence-based transmission metric that can be determined by sequencing the virus from each case. We calculated an instantaneous country-specific R at different stages of outbreaks and formulated a novel metric for infection dynamics using viral genome sequences to capture gaps in untraceable transmission. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing allows evidence-based dynamic disease outbreak tracking with predictive evidence.","Bandoy, D. D. R.; Weimer, B.

Methods.The ChiCTR database was comprehensively searched, and the COVID-19 research registration information as of February 24, 2020 was counted. Descriptive analysis of registration time trends and geographical distribution. Chi-square test was used to compare the statistical differences between different study types, intervention methods, research phases and major sponsors. Frequency studies were used to analyze the characteristics of CMT and BI therapy. Results.232 COVID-19 studies registered at the ChiCTR Center were collected. The overall number of COVID-19 registrations was increased. Hubei Province, China has the largest number of registrations, followed by Guangdong, Zhejiang and Sichuan. There were significant differences between the number of participants (P=0.000), study duration (P=0.008), study assignment (P=0.000), and blind method (P=0.000) for different study types. Significant differences could be seen in the dimensions of multicenter study(P=0.022), of participants numbe(P=0.000), study duration(P=0.000) and study assignment(P=0.001) for the four intervention methods. There were significant differences in study assignment (P=0.043) between the early and late studies. CMT drugs with high research frequency are chloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and I-IFN, which are all in phase 4; BI was Cell therapy, plasma therapy, Thymosin, and M/P-AB, which are all in early stages. Conclusion.There were problems of unclear classification of research types and irregular registration behavior. Also, within the studies researched, heterogeneity exists for various dimensions. Different research types, intervention methods, and research stages lead to significant differences in some dimensions of the COVID-19 study.

1029,How to improve adherence with quarantine: Rapid review of the evidence,"Objectives: The January 2020 outbreak of coronavirus has once again thrown the vexed issue of quarantine into the spotlight, with many countries asking their citizens to self-isolate if they have potentially come into contact with the infection. However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Study design: Rapid evidence review. Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. Results: We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","Webster, R.; Brooks, S.; Smith, L.; Woodland, L.; Wessely, S.; Rubin, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037408v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037408v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True

In France, there is an increasing concern regarding the capacity of the healthcare system to sustain the outbreak, especially regarding intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic in France, and to assess its impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan Region. We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (R0=1.5, R0=2.25, R0=3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (R0=1.5) to 161,832 in the worst case (R0=3), while the total number of deaths would vary from 1,021 to 11,032, respectively. At the regional level, all ICU capacities may be overrun in the worst scenario. Only seven Regions may lack ICU beds in the mild scenario (R0=2.25) and only one in the best case. In the three scenarios, Corse may be the first Region to see its ICU capacities overrun. The two other Regions, whose capacity will be overrun shortly after are Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comte. Our analysis shows that, even in the best case scenario, the French healthcare system will very soon be overwhelmed. While drastic social distancing measures may temper our results, a massive reorganization leading to an expansion of French ICU capacities seems to be necessary to manage the coming wave of critically affected COVID-19 patients.","Massonnaud, C.; Roux, J.; Crepey, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036939v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036939v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True

To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this letter, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases. The simulation results predict that China's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020 if the quarantine measures can continue to be executed.","Tao, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20035659v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20035659v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True

1035,Identification of antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 from FDA-approved drugs,"COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease and was recently declared as a pandemic by WHO. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic available for this disease. Drug repositioning represents the only feasible option to address this global challenge and a panel of 48 FDA-approved drugs that have been pre-selected by an assay of SARS-CoV was screened to identify potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a total of 24 drugs which exhibited antiviral efficacy (0.1 M < IC50 < 10 M) against SARS-CoV-2. In particular, two FDA-approved drugs - niclosamide and ciclesonide - were notable in some respects. These drugs will be tested in an appropriate animal model for their antiviral activities. In near future, these already FDA-approved drugs could be further developed following clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19.","Jeon, S.; Ko, M.; Lee, J.; Choi, I.; Byun, S.

1037,A prospect on the use of antiviral drugs to control local outbreaks of COVID-19,"Background: Current outbreaks of COVID-19 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. Control measures, based on isolation and quarantine, have been shown to decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modelling work shows that this intervention technique may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. Furthermore, the effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with a significant proportion of asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. Antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce the infectiousness, could be integrated in the control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. Methods: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a potent antiviral compound on the contact tracing process. Findings: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the final size, the peak incidence, and increases the probability that the outbreak will fade out. Interpretation: For an infectious disease in which presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when realized together with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. In addition, in all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of the administration of an antiviral drug in addition to quarantine, isolation and contact tracing. The resulting control measure, could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.","Torneri, A.; Libin, P. J.

1038,"Non-severe vs severe symptomatic COVID-19: 104 cases from the outbreak on the cruise ship ""Diamond Princess"" in Japan","Background: The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat. Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We compared the clinical features on admission among patients who were diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19 at the end of observation. Methods: This retrospective, single-center study included 104 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the mass infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship from February 11 to February 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until February 26, 2020. Clinical features on admission were compared among those with different disease severity at the end of observation. Univariate analysis identified factors associated with symptom onset and disease progression. Findings: The median age was 68 years, and 54 patients were male. Briefly, 43, 41, and 20 patients on admission and 33, 43, and 28 patients at the end of observation had asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Serum lactate hydrogenase levels were significantly higher in 10 patients who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period. Older age, consolidation on chest computed tomography, and lymphopenia on admission were more frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 than those with mild COVID-19 at the end of observation. Interpretation: Lactate dehydrogenase level is a potential predictor of symptom onset in COVID-19. Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to the clinical management.

1039,Hundreds of severe pediatric COVID-19 infections in Wuhan prior to the lockdown,"Before January 22, 2020, only one pediatric case of COVID-19 was reported in mainland China. However, a retrospective surveillance study identified six children who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in one of three central Wuhan hospitals between January 7th and January 15th. Given that Wuhan has over 395 other hospitals, there may have been far more severe pediatric cases than reported. There were six and 43 children out of 336 who tested positive for COVID-19 and influenza, respectively among all pediatric admissions during the 9-day period. By using this ratio in a detailed analysis of influenza surveillance data and COVID-19 epidemic dynamics (see Appendix), we estimate that there were 313 [95% CI: 171-520] children hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan during January 7-15, 2020 (Figure). Under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days4, we estimate that there were 1105 [95% CI: 592, 1829] cumulative pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations prior to the January 23rd lockdown, which far surpasses the 425 confirmed cases reported across all age groups, none of which were children under age 15. Children are strikingly absent from COVID-19 reports and limited data suggest that pediatric infections are overwhelmingly mild5. Thus, our estimates for hundreds of severe pediatric cases likely translates to thousands or even tens of thousands of mildly infected children, suggesting that the force of infection from children may be grossly underestimated and the infection fatality rate overestimated from confirmed case counts alone. This highlights the urgent need for more robust surveillance to gauge the true extent and severity of COVID-19 in all ages.","Du, Z.; Nugent, C.; Cowling, B. J.; Meyers, L.

1040,Favipiravir versus Arbidol for COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Background No clinically proven effective antiviral strategy exists for the epidemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2/first day followed by 600mg*2/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive Favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). Clinical recovery rate of Day 7 does not significantly differ between Favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (P=0.1396, difference of recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 to 0.2213). Favipiravir led to shorter latencies to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, P<0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, P<0.0001). No difference was observed of AOT or NMV rate (both P>0.05). The most frequently observed Favipiravir-associated adverse event was raised serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, P=0.0014). Conclusions Among patients with COVID-19, Favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinically recovery rate at Day 7. Favipiravir significantly improved the latency to relief for pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects caused Favipiravir are mild and manageable.

However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases.

We analyzed routine diagnostic data for >70,000 episodes of respiratory illness tested molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017. Statistical associations with patient age and sex differed between CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently and coinfections were not reported. With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs. These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Further work is needed to establish the occurrence/degree of cross-protective immunity conferred across sCoVs and with COVID-19, as well as the role of viral coinfection in COVID-19 disease severity.","Nickbakhsh, S.; Ho, A.; Marques, D.

Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Here, using polymerase extension experiments, we have demonstrated that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (a key component of the FDA approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA), is incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and blocks further incorporation. Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3-fluoro-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine, AZT and TAF, respectively) to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they also terminate further polymerase extension.

In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (b-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis.

1049,The first-in-class peptide binder to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an emerging global health crisis. With over 200,000 confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells, presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact interface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-RBD co-crystal structure, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) 1 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, we chemically synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ACE2 PD 1 helix composed entirely of proteinogenic amino acids. Chemical synthesis of this human derived sequence was complete in 1.5 hours and after work up and isolation >20 milligrams of pure material was obtained. Bio-layer interferometry revealed that this peptide specifically associates with the SARS-CoV-2-RBD with low nanomolar affinity. This peptide binder to SARS-CoV-2-RBD provides new avenues for COVID-19 treatment and diagnostic modalities by blocking the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2 and thus precluding virus entry into human cells.","Zhang, G.; Pomplun, S.; Loftis, A.

Methods: 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army between January 18 and February 26, 2020, were recruited. Two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated. Results: Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o. Conclusions: ELISA has a high sensitivity, especially for the detection of serum samples from patients after 10 d.p.o, it can be an important supplementary method for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Liu, W.; Liu, L.; Kou, G.; Zheng, Y.; Ding, Y.; Ni, W.; Wang, Q.; Tan, L.; Wu, W.; Tang, S.; Xiong, Z.; Zheng, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20035014v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20035014v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True

1052,Evaluation of recombinant nucleocapsid and spike proteins for serological diagnosis of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Background: The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) is a rapid diagnostic tool for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. However, with significant numbers of false negatives, improvements to GICA are needed. Methods: Six recombinant HCoV-19 nucleocapsid and spike proteins were prepared and evaluated. The optimal proteins were employed to develop a sandwich-format GICA strip to detect total antibodies (IgM and IgG) against HCoV-19. GICA performance was assessed with comparison of viral RNA detection. Results: Recombinant HCoV-19 proteins were obtained, including three prokaryotically expressed rN, rN1, rN2 nucleocapsid proteins, and three eukaryotically expressed rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc spike proteins. The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) against coronavirus-specific IgM and IgG were chosen for GICA development. The GICA has a sensitivity and specificity of 86.89% (106/122) and 99.39% (656/660), respectively. Furthermore, 65.63% (21/32) of the clinically confirmed but RT-PCR negative samples were GICA positive. Conclusions: The eukaryotically-expressed spike proteins (rS1and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotically expressed nucleocapsid proteins for HCoV-19 serological diagnosis. The GICA sandwich used to detect total antibodies is a powerful complement to the current standard RNA-based tests.","Zhang, P.; Gao, Q.; Wang, T.; Ke, Y.; Mo, F.; Jia, R.; Liu, W.; Liu, L.; Zheng, S.; Liu, Y.; Li, L.; Wang, Y.; Xu, L.; Hao, K.; Yang, R.; Li, S.; Lin, C.; Zhao, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20036954v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20036954v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True

Molecular diagnostic tools are central to containment of the virus and initiating proper clinical care. Rapidity, user-friendliness, and high degree of sensitivity and specificity are desirable features of diagnostic assays for screening purposes. Herein, we present a single step reverse transcriptase LAMP assay (RT-LAMP), which can detect up to 500 viral copies in 30 minutes. We challenged our assay with a large number of clinical samples collected from 47 confirmed cases and 213 negative patients. Our LAMP assay showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity compared to two commercialized qRT-PCR assay as gold standard. We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process 2.5 more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes.","Jiang, M.; Fang, W.; Aratehfar, A.; Li, X.; ling, L.; Fang, H.; Farnaz Daneshnia, F.; Yu, J.; Liao, W.; Pei, H.; Pan, W.; Lass-Florl, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036376v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036376v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1054,Roles of meteorological conditions in COVID-19 transmission on a worldwide scale,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/ 2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has caused great damage to public health and economy worldwide with over 140,000 infected cases up to date. Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.","Chen, B.; Liang, H.; Yuan, X.; Hu, Y.; Xu, M.; Zhao, Y.; Zhang, B.; Tian, F.; Zhu, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037168v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037168v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1055,"Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: zoonotic vs. human to human transmission, China, 2019-2020","Objectives: The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan has rapidly spread throughout China. While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. Methods: Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidenceincluding contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions. Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportions of asymptomatic and subclinical patients constitute a substantial component of the epidemic's magnitude. Findings suggest that the development of rapid diagnostic tests could help bring the epidemic more rapidly under control.","Mizumoto, K.; Kagaya, K.; Chowell, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037036v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037036v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1056,Analysis of Epidemic Situation of New Coronavirus Infection at Home and Abroad Based on Rescaled Range (R/S) Method,"1Summary 1.1 Background The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection broke out in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, and has spread to 97 countries and regions around the world. Apart from China, there are currently three other severely affected areas, namely Italy, South Korea, and Iran. This poses a huge threat to China's and even global public health security, challenges scientific research work such as disease surveillance and tracking, clinical treatment, and vaccine development, and it also brings huge uncertainty to the global economy. As of March 11, 2020, the epidemic situation in China is nearing its end, but the epidemic situation abroad is in the outbreak period. Italy has even taken measures to close the city nationwide, with a total of 118,020 cases of infection worldwide. 1.2 Method This article selects the data of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 at home and abroad as the data sample. Among them: the data of newly confirmed cases abroad is represented by Italy, and the span is from February 13 to March 10. The data of newly confirmed cases at home are divided into two parts: Hubei Province and other provinces except Hubei Province, spanning from January 23 to March 3, and with February 12 as the cutting point, it is divided into two periods, the growth period and the recession period. The rescaled range (R / S) analysis method and the dimensionless fractal Hurst exponent are used to measure the correlation of time series to determine whether the time series conforms to the fractal Brownian motion, that is, a biased random process. Contrast analysis of the meaning of H value in different stages and different overall H values in the same stage. 1.3 Results Based on R / S analysis and calculated Hurst value of newly confirmed cases in Hubei and non-Hubei provinces, it was found that the H value of Hubei Province in the first stage was 0.574, which is greater than 0.5, indicating that the future time series has a positive correlation and Fractal characteristics; The H value in the second stage is 1.368, which is greater than 1, which indicates that the future epidemic situation is completely preventable and controllable, and the second stage has a downward trend characteristic, which indicates that there is a high probability that the future time series will decline. The H values of the first and second stages of non-Hubei Province are 0.223 and 0.387, respectively, which are both less than 0.5, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the future is likely to return to historical points, and the H value in the second stage is greater than that in the first stage, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the second stage is more long-term memory than the time series of confirmed cases in the first stage. The daily absolute number of newly confirmed cases in Italy was converted to the daily growth rate of confirmed cases to eliminate the volatility of the data. The H value was 1.853, which was greater than 1, indicating that the time series of future confirmed cases is similar to the trend of historical changes. The daily rate of change in cases will continue to rise. 1.4 Conclusion According to the different interpretation of the H value obtained by the R / S analysis method, hierarchical isolation measures are adopted accordingly. When the H value is greater than 0.5, it indicates that the development of the epidemic situation in the area has more long-term memory, that is, when the number of confirmed cases in the past increases rapidly, the probability of the time series of confirmed cases in the future will continue the historical trend. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate strict anti-epidemic measures in accordance with the actual conditions of various countries, to detect, isolate, and treat early to reduce the base of infectious agents.","Ji, X.; Tang, Z.; Wang, K.; Li, X.; Li, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036756v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036756v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1057,Dynamic profile of severe or critical COVID-19 cases,"In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, China. World Health Organization (WHO) declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020, acknowledging what has seemed clear for some time-the virus will likely spread to all countries on the globe. As of February 11, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has officially reported that there are 2.0% (889) asymptomatic cases, 2.3% (1,023) death cases, and 80.9% mild cases among 44,672 confirmed cases. 51.4% (22,981) were male and 48.6% (21,691) were female. Lymphopenia, in particular T lymphopenia, was common among patients with SARS-COV-2 in the observation. A notable drop in CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts occurred early in the course of the syndrome and was associated with adverse outcomes. The appearing a phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) suggested severe adverse outcomes.

1058,Effect of continuous renal replacement therapy on all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation: a retrospective cohort study,"Background: Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout the world, critically ill patients have a high mortality rate. We aimed to assess the effect of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on all cause mortality in patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation at Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan from February 12th to March 2nd, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. All patients were followed until death or end of follow up (March 9th), and all survivors were followed for at least one week. Findings: Of 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 (SD 1.8) years and 30 (83.3%) were men. 22 (61.1%) patients received CRRT (CRRT group) and 14 cases (38.9%) were managed in conventional strategy (non CRRT group). There was no difference in age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments and most of the laboratory findings, except for patients in the CRRT group with higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase and serum creatinine. During the average follow-up period of 10.4 days, 12 of 22 (54.5%) patients in CRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in non CRRT group died. Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated a prolonged survival in patients in CRRT group than non CRRT group (P=0.032). The association between CRRT treatment and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors in seven different models, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) varying between 0.283 and 0.424. Older age, higher levels of IL1b, IL2 receptor, hs cTnI and NT proBNP were independently associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with CRRT treatment. Interpretation: CRRT may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID 19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. Further prospective multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required.","Yang, Y.; Shi, J.; Ge, S.; Guo, S.; Xing, X.; Wang, Y.; Cheng, A.; Liu, Q.; Li, J.; Ning, Y.; He, F.; Xu, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036780v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036780v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1059,Predicting the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in China and across the world using the machine learning approach,"Background: Although COVID-19 has been well controlled in China, it is rapidly spreading outside the country and may have catastrophic results globally without implementation of necessary mitigation measures. Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most have used early-stage data and focused on Chinese cases. Methods: We first built models to predict daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on data from January 20, 2020, to March 1, 2020. Based on these models, we built models to predict the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). We also built models to predict the epidemic trend in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading. Findings: The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked on February 22, 2020, in China and will peak on May 22, 2020, across the world. It will be basically under control in early April 2020 in China and end-August 2020 across the world. The total number of COVID-19 cases will reach around 89,000 in China and 6,126,000 across the world during the epidemic. Around 4,000 and 290,000 people will die of COVID-19 in China and across the world, respectively. The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked recently in Italy and will peak in Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA within two weeks. Interpretation: The COVID-19 outbreak is controllable in the foreseeable future if comprehensive and stringent control measures are taken.","Li, M.; Zhang, Z.; Jiang, S.; Liu, Q.; Chen, C.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038117v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038117v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1060,"Sentinel Event Surveillance to Estimate Total SARS-CoV-2 Infections, United States","Human infections with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were first identified via syndromic surveillance in December of 2019 in Wuhan China. Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 180,000 confirmed cases as of March 16, 2020. Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections. We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total number of incident SARS- CoV-2 infections in the United States on March 1, 2020, and to forecast subsequent infections potentially undetected by current testing strategies. Our analysis and forecasting estimates a total of 54,100 SARS-CoV-2 infections (80 % CI 5,600 to 125,300) have occurred in the United States to March 12, 2020. Our forecast predicts that a very substantial number of infections are undetected, and without extensive and far-reaching non-pharmaceutical interventions, the number of infections should be expected to grow at an exponential rate.","Lover, A.

1061,Modeling and Forecasting Trend of COVID-19 Epidemic in Iran,"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging disease and precise data are not available in the world and Iran. this study aimed to determine the epidemic trend and prediction of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis and modeling. We used the daily reports of definitive COVID-19 patients (sampling of severe cases and hospitalization) released by Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Epidemic projection models of Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy and least squared error (LSE) were used to predict the number of cases at April 3, 2020 until May 13, 2020. Results: R0 in Iran was estimated to be 4.7 that has now fallen to below 2. Given the three different scenarios, the prediction of the patients on April 3, 2020 by Von Bertalanffy, Gompertz and LSE were estimated at 48200, 52500 and 58000, respectively. The number of deceased COVID-19 patients was also estimated to be 3600 individuals using the Von growth model, 4200 ones by Gompertz's model and 4850 ones according to the LSE method. To predict and estimate the number of patients and deaths in the end of epidemic based on Von and Gompertz models, we will have 87000 cases, 4900 and 11000 deaths until 13 May and 1 June, respectively. Conclusion: The process of controlling the epidemic is tangible. If enforcement and public behavior interventions continue with current trends, the control and reduction of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran will be flat from April 28, until July, 2020 and new cases are expected to decline from the following Iranian new year.","Ahmadi, A.; Shirani, M.; Rahmani, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037671v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037671v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True

Although the clinical features of COVID-19 have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes are lacking. Objectives: To summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were searched through February 25, 2020. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed COVID-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: A total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study, the mean age was 49.8 years (95% CI, 47.5-52.2 yrs) and 55.5% were male. The pooled incidence of severity and mortality were 20.2% (95% CI, 15.1-25.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9-4.2%), respectively. The predictor for disease severity included old age ([&ge;] 50 yrs, odds ratio [OR] = 2.61; 95% CI, 2.29-2.98), male (OR =1.348, 95% CI, 1.195-1.521), smoking (OR =1.734, 95% CI, 1.146-2.626) and any comorbidity (OR = 2.635, 95% CI, 2.098-3.309), especially chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR = 6.017; 95% CI, 2.192-16.514), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, OR = 5.323; 95% CI, 2.613-10.847) and cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.219; 95% CI, 1.486-6.972). In terms of laboratory results, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and decreased blood platelet and lymphocytes count were highly associated with severe COVID-19 (all for P < 0.001).

Here, we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters to inform epidemiologists, public health officials, and policy makers. We show preliminary results from a survey of over 38,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Researchers from the U.S, Spain, and Italy have adopted our approach and we are collaborating to further improve it. We call with urgency for other countries to join this international consortium, and to share methods and data collected from these daily, simple, one-minute surveys.","Rossman, H.; Keshet, A.; Shilo, S.; Gavrieli, A.; Bauman, T.; Cohen, O.; Balicer, R.; Geiger, B.; Dor, Y.; Segal, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038844v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038844v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1065,Investigating the Impact of Asymptomatic Carriers on COVID-19 Transmission,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel human respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.","Aguilar, J.

1066,The prevention of nosocomial SARS-CoV2 transmission in endoscopy: a systematic review of recommendations within gastroenterology to identify best practice.,"Endoscopy generates aerosol droplets and fomites, thereby increasing the risk of SARS-CoV2 transmission to healthcare workers and uninfected patients within endoscopy departments. Despite the sharp rise in the incidence of COVID-19, authoritative recommendations to limit the spread of SARS-CoV2 within gastrointestinal endoscopy units are lacking. Therefore, with the primary aim of identifying best practice and scrutinizing its supporting evidence, we conducted a systematic review of literature for articles published between 1 January 2002 and 15 March 2020 in five databases relating to both the current SARS-CoV2 and the previous SARS-CoV outbreaks. Official websites for gastroenterology and endoscopy societies in the 15 most affected countries were also searched. Unfortunately, a paucity of high quality data and heterogeneity of recommendations between countries was observed. Interestingly, not all countries advocated the postponement of non-urgent or elective procedures. Recommendations for patient screening and personal protective equipment were commonly featured in all recommendations but specifics varied. Only 32% (9/28) of all gastroenterology and endoscopy societies issued guidance on endoscopy in the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, stronger evidence to inform current practice and robust guidelines are urgently needed to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in gastrointestinal endoscopy departments worldwide.","Ong, J.; Cross, G.

1067,AAEDM: Theoretical Dynamic Epidemic Diffusion Model and Covid-19 Korea Pandemic Cases,"This paper deals with an advanced analytical epidemic diffusion model which is capable to predict the status of epidemic impacts. This newly propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and data sciences. The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system. This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytical model has been designed from a basic exponential growth model, the performance of the AAEDM is competitive with other Bigdata based simulation models. Since the AAEDM is relatively simple and handy, anyone can use this model into analyzing outbreak situations in his daily life.","Kim, S.-K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037838v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037838v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1068,A Novel Triage Tool of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Diagnosis Aid System for Suspected COVID-19 pneumonia In Fever Clinics,"Currently, the prevention and control of COVID-19 outside Hubei province in China, and other countries has become more and more critically serious. We developed and validated a diagnosis aid model without CT images for early identification of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (S-COVID-19-P) on admission in adult fever patients and made the validated model available via an online triage calculator. Patients admitted from Jan 14 to Feb 26, 2020 with the epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19 were included [Model development (n = 132) and validation (n = 32)]. Candidate features included clinical symptoms, routine laboratory tests and other clinical information on admission. Features selection and model development were based on Lasso regression. The primary outcome is the development and validation of a diagnosis aid model for S-COVID-19-P early identification on admission. The development cohort contains 26 S-COVID-19-P and 7 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The model performance in held-out testing set and validation cohort resulted in AUCs of 0.841 and 0.938, F-1 score of 0.571 and 0.667, recall of 1.000 and 1.000, specificity of 0.727 and 0.778, and the precision of 0.400 and 0.500. Based on this model, an optimized strategy for S-COVID-19-P early identification in fever clinics has also been designed. S-COVID-19-P could be identified early by a machine-learning model only used collected clinical information without CT images on admission in fever clinics with 100% recall score.

1069,Intensive Care Unit Resource Planning During COVID-19 Emergency at the Regional Level: the Italian case.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a worldwide emergency and a pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO). It started in China in December 2019, and it is currently rapidly spreading throughout Italy, which is now the most affected country after China. There is great attention for the diffusion and evolution of the CoVid-19 infection which started from the north (particularly in the Lombardia region) and it is now rapidly affecting other Italian regions. We investigate on the impact of patients hospitalisation in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at a regional and subregional granularity. We propose a model derived from well-known models in epidemic to estimate the needed number of places in intensive care units. The model will help decision-makers to plan resources in the short and medium-term in order to guarantee appropriate treatments to all patients needing it. We analyse Italian data at regional level up to March 15th aiming to: (i) support health and government decision-makers in gathering rapid and efficient decisions on increasing health structures capacities (in terms of ICU slots) and (ii) define a scalable geographic model to plan emergency and future CoVid-19 patients management using reallocating them among health structures. Finally, the here proposed model can be useful in countries where CoVid-19 is not yet strongly diffused.","Guzzi, P.

1070,Short-range airborne route dominates exposure of respiratory infection during close contact,"A susceptible person experiences the highest exposure risk of respiratory infection when he or she is in close proximity with an infected person. The large droplet route has been commonly believed to be dominant for most respiratory infections since the early 20th century, and the associated droplet precaution is widely known and practiced in hospitals and in the community. The mechanism of exposure to droplets expired at close contact, however, remains surprisingly unexplored. In this study, the exposure to exhaled droplets during close contact (< 2 m) via both the short-range airborne and large droplet sub-routes is studied using a simple mathematical model of expired flows and droplet dispersion/deposition/inhalation, which enables the calculation of exposure due to both deposition and inhalation. The short-range airborne route is found to dominate at most distances studied during both talking and coughing. The large droplet route only dominates when the droplets are larger than 100 m and when the subjects are within 0.2 m while talking or 0.5 m while coughing. The smaller the exhaled droplets, the more important the short-range airborne route. The large droplet route contributes less than 10% of exposure when the droplets are smaller than 50 m and when the subjects are more than 0.3 m apart, even while coughing.","Chen, W.; Zhang, N.; Wei, J.; YEN, H.-L.; Li, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037291v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037291v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1071,SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in COVID-19 patients,"A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic. Whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies.","OKBA, N. M.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the prevention of the outbreak and management of patients. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay detected the virus in clinical laboratory. Methods: This study utilized primers and single-quencher probes in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed the double-quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one-step real-time RT-PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection sensitivity. Results: The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT-PCR was relatively low in CDC and YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that both CDC and YCH assays could detect a low-copy number of DNA positive control. The background fluorescent signal at the baseline was lower in YCH than that of NIID.

However, these recommendations have also faced controversy and opposition. Methods: Using previously published information and publicly available data on COVID19 infections, we calculated a transmission rate and generated a mathematical model to predict a lower bound for the number of healthcare-acquired COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling or postponing elective outpatient surgeries in Washington state. Results: Our model predicts that over the course of 30 days, at least 75.9 preventable patient infections and at least 69.3 preventable healthcare worker (HCW) infections would occur in WA state alone if elective outpatient procedures were to continue as usual. Conclusion: Canceling elective outpatient surgeries during the COVID19 pandemic could prevent a large number of patient and healthcare worker infections.","Zhang, Y.; Cheng, S.-R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037952v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037952v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1074,Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients: the perspective application of serological tests in clinical practice,"Background We aim to investigate the profile of acute antibody response in COVID-19 patients, and provide proposals for the usage of antibody test in clinical practice. Methods A multi-center cross-section study (285 patients) and a single-center follow-up study (63 patients) were performed to investigate the feature of acute antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. A cohort of 52 COVID-19 suspects and 64 close contacts were enrolled to evaluate the potentiality of the antibody test. Results The positive rate for IgG reached 100% around 20 days after symptoms onset. The median day of serocon-version for both lgG and IgM was 13 days after symptoms onset. Seroconversion of IgM occurred at the same time, or earlier, or later than that of IgG. IgG levels in 100% patients (19/19) entered a platform within 6 days after seroconversion. The criteria of IgG seroconversion and [&ge;] 4-fold increase in the IgG titers in sequential samples together diagnosed 82.9% (34/41) of the patients. Antibody test aided to confirm 4 patients with COVID-19 from 52 suspects who failed to be confirmed by RT-PCR and 7 patients from 148 close contacts with negative RT-PCR. Conclusion IgM and IgG should be detected simultaneously at the early phase of infection. The serological diagnosis criterion of seroconversion or [&ge;] 4-fold increase in the IgG titer is suitable for a majority of COVID-19 patients.

In this report, we estimate the global tendency of COVID-19 and analyze the associated global epidemic risk, given that the status quo is continued without further measures being taken. The results show that the global R_0, excluding China, is estimated to be 2.49 (95% CI: 2.15 - 2.92). The United States, Germany, Italy and Spain have peak values over 100,000. According to dynamical model and cluster analysis, we category the globe into four type regional epicenters of the outbreak: Southeast Asia extending southward to Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe and North America. Among them, Western Europe will become the major center of the outbreak. The peak values in Germany, Italy and Spain are estimated to be 105,903, 127,283 and 152,539, respectively. The United States is the country with the most serious outbreak trend. Based on the current control measures by Mar. 27, 2020, the peak value in the United States will reach 400,892. Above all, if the current control measures are maintained, the cumulative number of patients worldwide will be 1,442,523 (95% CI: 1,052,577 - 8,981,440).

To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials. Methods: A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms ""2019-nCoV"", ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""Hcov-19"", ""new coronavirus"", ""novel coronavirus"". We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents. Findings: Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the trials were randomized with parallel assignment and the median number of planned inclusions was 63 (IQR, 36-120). Open-label studies were the most frequent (46%) followed by double-blind (13%) and single blind studies (10%). The most frequently assessed therapies were: stem cells therapy (n=23 trials), lopinavir/ritonavir (n=15), chloroquine (n=11), umifenovir (n=9), hydroxychloroquine (n=7), plasma treatment (n=7), favipiravir (n=7), methylprednisolone (n=5), and remdesivir (n=5). Remdesivir was tested in 5 trials with a median of 400 (IQR, 394-453) planned inclusions per trial, while stem cells therapy was tested in 23 trials, but had a median of 40 (IQR, 23-60) planned inclusions per trial. Lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with the highest total number of planned inclusions (2606) followed by remdesivir (2155). Only 52% of the clinical trials reported the treatment dose (n=60) and only 34% (n=39) the duration. The primary outcome was clinical in 76 studies (66%), virological in 27 (23%); radiological in 9 (8%) or immunological in three studies (3%).

1077,"Extended SIR prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in Italy and compared with Hunan, China","Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) is currently a global public health threat. Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies.","Jia, W.; Han, K.; Song, Y.; Cao, W.; Wang, S.; Yang, S.; Wang, J.; Kou, F.; Tai, P.; Li, J.; Liu, M.; He, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038570v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038570v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1078,PREDICTING THE EVOLUTION OF COVID-19 IN PORTUGAL USING AN ADAPTED SIR MODEL PREVIOUSLY USED IN SOUTH KOREA FOR THE MERS OUTBREAK,"Since original reports in Wuhan, China, the new coronavirus covid-19 has spread very quickly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a state of pandemic. Moreover, as of the 13th of March 2020, the WHO has announced that the European continent is now the main centre of the pandemic. Many European governments have already implemented harsh measures to attempt to contain the spread of the virus. In Portugal, there are, as of the 20th of March 2020, 1020 confirmed cases. One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. A timely idea of the amount of cases that will exist in a near future can allow governments and policy makers to act accordingly. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct two or three different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the self-protective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people by the beginning of April. If measures are appropriately taken this number can be reduced to about 800 cases. In case that some measures are taken, but their implementation is not done appropriately, the active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. The actual figures probably lie between the interval (~800-7,000) and the peak will be reached between 9th and the 20nd of April 2020. Without control and self-protective measures, this model predicts that the figures of active cases of SARS-covid-2 would reach a staggering ~40,000 people It shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~800-7,000 people.

1079,"Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China. As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.","Zhang, J.; Litvinova, M.; Liang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Wang, W.; Zhao, S.; Wu, Q.; Merler, S.; Viboud, C.; Vespignani, A.; Ajelli, M.; Yu, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039107v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039107v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True

1081,Response and role of palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national telephone survey of hospices in Italy,"Background Palliative care is an essential component of healthcare in pandemics, contributing to symptom control, psychological support, and supporting triage and complex decision making. Aim To examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries. Design Cross-sectional telephone survey, carried out in March 2020. Setting Sixteen Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 risk into high (more than 25 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), medium (15-25 cases per 100,000), and low risk (fewer than 15 cases per 100,000) regions. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. Results Seven high risk, five medium risk and four low risk hospices provided data. Two high risk hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria, and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute setting. Conclusion The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response. Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.","Costantini, M.; Sleeman, K. E.; Peruselli, C.; Higginson, I.

1082,"Fear, Access, and the Real-Time Estimation of Etiological Parameters for Outbreaks of Novel Pathogens","Early analysis of outbreaks of novel pathogens to evaluate their likely public health impact depends on fitting predictive models to data gathered and updated in real-time. Both transmission rates and the critical threshold (i.e. the pathogen's 'reproductive number') are inferred by finding the values that provide the best model fit to reported case incidence. These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations of these parameters to a few examples of different types of shifting influences acting on detection, depending on the likely sensitivity of surveillance systems to errors from sources such as clinical testing rates and differences in healthcare-seeking behavior from the public over time. Finally, we discuss the implications of these corrections for both historical and current outbreaks.","Fefferman, N.

1083,"A Tool to Early Predict Severe 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) : A Multicenter Study using the Risk Nomogram in Wuhan and Guangdong, China","Background Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly develop acute respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure, with high short-term mortality rates. At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. Findings The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19 and 107 (28.76%) patients had one of the following basic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978]) in the train cohort with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ; 0.853 [0.790-0.916] in validation cohort with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4%. The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. Interpretation Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates. The RDW plays an important role in predicting severe COVID-19, implying that the role of RBC in severe disease is underestimated.","Gong, J.; Ou, J.; Qiu, X.; Jie, Y.; Chen, Y.; Yuan, L.; Cao, J.; Tan, M.; Xu, W.; Zheng, F.; Shi, Y.; Hu, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037515v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1084,"Tracing DAY-ZERO and Forecasting the Fade out of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A Compartmental Modelling and Numerical Optimization Approach.","Italy currently constitutes the epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, having surpassed China's death toll. The disease is sweeping through Lombardy, which remains in lockdown since the 8th of March. As of the same day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy have been extended to the entire country. Here, we provide estimates for: (a) the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of exposed/infected cases in the total population; (c) the basic reproduction number (R0); (d) the ""effective"" per-day disease transmission; and, importantly, (e) a forecast for the fade out of the outbreak, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. Methods. To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual exposed/ infected cases in the total population, we address a compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the total cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death, the case fatality ratio, and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the effective per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the SEIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March, the lockdown day of Lombardy and of all Italy. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms. Based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. Furthermore, based on an estimation for the reduction in the effective transmission rate of the disease as of March 8 that reflects the suspension of almost all activities in Italy, we ran the simulator to forecast the fade out of the epidemic. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, the effect of social distancing, and the draconian measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. Results. Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the DAY-ZERO was most likely between January 6 and January 24 with the most probable date the 15th of January 2020. The actual cumulative number of exposed cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases. The effective per-day disease transmission rate for the period until March 8 was found to be 0.687 (90% CI: 0.668, 0.706) while the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.53 (90% CI: 4.28, 4.80). Importantly, simulations show that the COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy is expected to fade out by the end of May - early June, 2020, if the draconian, as of March 20 and March 21, measures are maintained.","Russo, L.; Anastassopoulou, C.; Tsakris, A.; Bifulco, G.

1085,Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with nanoparticles-based biosensor for diagnosis of COVID-19,"Given the scale and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, known as 2019-nCov) infection (COVID-19), the ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has become a huge public health issue. Rapid and precise diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19, providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment (such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63 C) for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified and detected in a one-step and single-tube reaction, and the detection results were easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33) in the oropharynx swab samples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96) when analyzed the clinical samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from sample collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h. In sum, the RT-LAMP-NBS is a promising tool for diagnosing the current SARS-CoV-2 infection in first line field, public health and clinical laboratories, especially for resource-challenged regions.","Zhu, X.; Wang, X.; Han, L.; Chen, T.; Wang, L.; Li, H.; Li, S.; He, L.; Fu, X.; Chen, S.; Mei, X.; Chen, H.; Wang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037796v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037796v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True
1086,Chinese Public Attention to COVID-19 Epidemic: Based on Social Media,"Background: Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics has changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Finally, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: (1) new COVID-19 epidemics and their impact; (2) frontline reporting of the epidemic and prevention and control measures; (3) expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection; (4) medical services on the frontline of the epidemic; and (5) focus on the global epidemic and the search for suspected cases. Conclusions: This is the first study of public attention on the COVID-19 epidemic using a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog). Our study found that social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in most rich countries, and delivering chemotherapy may be associated with increased risk in the presence of a pandemic infection. Estimating this risk is crucial in making decisions about balancing risks and benefits from administering chemotherapy. However, there are no specific data about chemotherapy risks per se. Here we develop a simple model to estimate the potential harms in patients undergoing chemotherapy during a COVID outbreak. We use age-related case fatality rates as a basis for estimating risk, and use previous data from risk of death during influenza outbreaks to estimate the additional risk associated with chemotherapy. We use data from randomised trials to estimate benefit across a range of curative and palliative settings, and address the balance of benefit against the risk of harm. We then use those data to estimate the impact on national chemotherapy delivery patterns.","Williams, M.; Le Calvez, K.; Mi, E.; Chen, J.; Dadhania, S.; Pakzad-Shahabi, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038067v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038067v1?rss=1,2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,True

As of March 12, 2020, a total number of 7,869 cases and 66 deaths had been documented in South Korea. Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Method Using the data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea that are publicly available from the KCDC, this paper aims to create spatial visualizations of COVID-19 transmission between January 20, 2020 and February 19, 2020. Results Using spatial visualization, this paper identified two early transmission clusters in South Korea (Daegu cluster and capital area cluster). Using a degree-weighted centrality measure, this paper proposes potential super-spreaders of the virus in the visualized clusters. Conclusion Compared to various epidemiological measures such as the basic reproduction number, spatial visualizations of the cluster-specific transmission networks and the proposed centrality measure may be more useful to characterize super-spreaders and the spread of the virus especially in the early epidemic phase.","Park, J.

1089,High transmissibility of COVID-19 near symptom onset,"Background The dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmissibility after symptom onset remains unknown. Methods We conducted a prospective case-ascertained study on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and their contacts. Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) was analyzed for different exposure windows after symptom onset of index cases and for different exposure settings. Results Thirty-two confirmed patients were enrolled and 12 paired data (index-secondary cases) were identified among the 1,043 contacts. The secondary clinical attack rate was 0.9% (95% CI 0.5-1.7%). The attack rate was higher among those whose exposure to index cases started within five days of symptom onset (2.4%, 95% CI 1.1-4.5%) than those who were exposed later (zero case from 605 close contacts, 95% CI 0-0.61%). The attack rate was also higher among household contacts (13.6%, 95% CI 4.7-29.5%) and non-household family contacts (8.5%, 95% CI 2.4-20.3%) than that in healthcare or other settings. The higher secondary clinical attack rate for contacts near symptom onset remained when the analysis was restricted to household and family contacts. There was a trend of increasing attack rate with the age of contacts (p for trend < 0.001). Conclusions High transmissibility of COVID-19 near symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized social distancing measures are required. Rapid reduction of transmissibility over time implies that prolonged hospitalization of mild cases might not be necessary in large epidemics.","Cheng, H.-Y.; Jian, S.-W.; Liu, D.-P.; Ng, T.-C.; Huang, W.-T.; Taiwan COVID-19 outbreak investigation team,; Lin, H.-H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20034561v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20034561v1?rss=1,2020-03-19,2020-03-19,,True

In this study, we examined Rt of COVID-19 and compared its transmissibility between different intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Methods: Daily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 were analysed. A likelihood function was constructed to estimate Rt, accounting for imported cases. Results: Although Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-February. Conclusion: The lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Meanwhile, cities with similar epidemic trend could have different transmission dynamics given the variation in imported cases.","Chong, K.

Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.","Dowd, J. B.; Rotondi, V.; Adriano, L.; Brazel, D.

1094,Highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by digital PCR,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel Coronavirus (termed SARS-CoV-2) has spread to over 140 countries around the world. Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach. METHODSWe established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents. RESULTS: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were ~1.6, ~1.6 and ~0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients. CONCLUSION: RT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.","dong, l.; Zhou, J.; Niu, C.; Wang, Q.; Pan, Y.; Wang, X.; zhang, Y.; yang, J.; Liu, M.; zhao, Y.; peng, T.; xie, J.; gao, y.; wang, D.; zhao, y.; Dai, X.; fang, x.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036129v1?rss=1,2020-03-18,2020-03-18,,True
1095,"CoViD--19: An Automatic, Semiparametric Estimation Method for the Population Infected in Italy","To date, official data on the number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 , responsible for the CoViD19 , have been released by the Italian Government just on the basis of a non representative sample of population which tested positive for the swab. However a reliable estimation of the number of infected, including asymptomatic people, turns out to be crucial in the preparation of operational schemes and to estimate the future number of people, who will require, to different extents, medical attentions. In order to overcome the current data shortcoming, this paper proposes a bootstrap driven, estimation procedure for the number of people infected with the SARSCoV2. This method is designed to be robust, automatic and suitable to generate estimations at regional level.

This study aims to explore the association between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) death and weather parameters. Methods In this study, we collected the daily death number of COVID-19, meteorological and air pollutant data from 20 January, 2020 to 29 February, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Then, the generalized additive model was applied to explore the impact of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on daily mortality of COVID-19. Results There were in total 2299 COVID-19 mortality counts in Wuhan. A positive association with COVID-19 mortality was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = -0.32). In addition, each 1 unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 mortality at lag 3. However, both per 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 mortality at lag 3 and lag 5, respectively. Conclusion In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.","Ma, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Liu, J.; He, X.; Wang, B.; Fu, S.; Yan, J.; Niu, J.; Luo, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036426v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036426v1?rss=1,2020-03-18,2020-03-18,,True

1100,Is a 14-day quarantine period optimal for effectively controlling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?,"Background The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (Covid-19) has become pandemic. To be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. At the moment, the WHO-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult- and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. Therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole Covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal. Methods We compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. This cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 disease with both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. Results The full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. There were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years and 2 males with a median age of 36 years. The median incubation period of both male and female adults was similar (7-day) but significantly shorter than that (9-day) of child cases (P=0.02). This cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. Interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11.6%) were longer than the WHO-established quarantine period (14 days). Data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96.2% or 98.3%, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined. Patients transmitted via lunch/dinner parties (i.e., gastrointestinal tract infection through oral transmission) had a significantly longer incubation period (9-day) than other adults transmitted via respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces and objects (P<0.004). Conclusions The whole Covid-19 population including both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases had a median incubation period of 7-day for adults, which is 1.8-day longer than the hospitalized cases reported previously. An extension of the adult quarantine period to 18 days or 21 days could be more effective in preventing virus-spreading and controlling the disease. The cases transmitted by lunch/dinner parties could be infected first in the gastrointestinal tract through oral transmission and then infected in the respiratory system so that they had a longer incubation period.","Jiang, X.; Niu, Y.; Li, X.; Li, L.; Cai, W.; Chen, Y.; Liao, B.; Wang, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036533v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036533v1?rss=1,2020-03-18,2020-03-18,,True

1105,A serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans,"Introduction: SARS-Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2), which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) was first detected in China in late 2019 and has since then caused a global pandemic. While molecular assays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection, we currently lack serological assays suitable to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. These assays were developed with negative control samples representing pre-COVID 19 background immunity in the general population and samples from COVID19 patients. Results: The assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of COVID19 seroconverters using human plasma/serum as early as 3 days post symptom onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling. Conclusion: Serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers will also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients.","Amanat, F.; Nguyen, T.; Chromikova, V.; Strohmeier, S.; Stadlbauer, D.; Javier, A.; Jiang, K.; Asthagiri-Arunkumar, G.; Polanco, J.; Bermudez-Gonzalez, M.; Caplivski, D.; Cheng, A.; Kedzierska, K.; Vapalahti, O.; Hepojoki, J.; Simon, V.; Krammer, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1?rss=1,2020-03-18,2020-03-18,,True

1107,Effect of large-scale testing platform in prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic: an empirical study with a novel numerical model,"Background: China adopted an unprecedented province-scale quarantine since January 23rd 2020, after the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan in December 2019. Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of ""daily settlement"" (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, ""daily settlement"" for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately. Conclusions: Large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost. Such infrastructure like Huo-Yan, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common times and emergencies.","Xie, Q.; Wang, J.; You, J.; Zhu, S.; Zhou, R.; Tian, Z.; Wu, H.; Lin, Y.; Chen, W.; Xiao, L.; Wu, H.; Chen, W.; Wang, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036624v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036624v1?rss=1,2020-03-18,2020-03-18,,True
1108,Estimating unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States,"By March 2020, COVID-19 led to thousands of deaths and disrupted economic activity worldwide. As a result of narrow case definitions and limited capacity for testing, the number of unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections during its initial invasion of the US remains unknown. We developed an approach for estimating the number of unobserved infections based on data that are commonly available shortly after the emergence of a new infectious disease. The logic of our approach is, in essence, that there are bounds on the amount of exponential growth of new infections that can occur during the first few weeks after imported cases start appearing. Applying that logic to data on imported cases and local deaths in the US through March 12, we estimated that 22,876 (95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) infections occurred in the US by this date. By comparing the model's predictions of symptomatic infections to local cases reported over time, we obtained daily estimates of the proportion of symptomatic infections detected by surveillance. This revealed that detection of symptomatic infections decreased throughout February as exponential growth of infections outpaced increases in testing. Between February 21 and March 12, we estimated an increase in detection of symptomatic infections, which was strongly correlated (median: 0.97, 95% PPI: 0.85 - 0.98) with increases in testing. These results suggest that testing was a major limiting factor in assessing the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during its initial invasion of the US.","Perkins, A.; Cavany, S. M.; Moore, S.

1109,Correcting under-reported COVID-19 case numbers,"The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide in a matter of a few months, while healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases. Testing results have struggled with the relative capabilities, testing policies and preparedness of each affected country, making their comparison a non-trivial task. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases, the reported virus mortality is likely inflated in most countries. Lockdowns and changes in human behavior modulate the underlying growth rate of the virus. Under-sampling of infection cases may lead to the under-estimation of total cases, resulting in systematic mortality estimation biases. For healthcare systems worldwide it is important to know the expected number of cases that will need treatment. In this manuscript, we identify a generalizable growth rate decay reflecting behavioral change. We propose a method to correct the reported COVID-19 cases and death numbers by using a benchmark country (South Korea) with near-optimal testing coverage, with considerations on population demographics. We extrapolate expected deaths and hospitalizations with respect to observations in countries that passed the exponential growth curve. By applying our correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries and a significant burden on worldwide hospital capacity.","Lachmann, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036178v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.14.20036178v1?rss=1,2020-03-18,2020-03-18,,True
1110,Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in an Early Prefusion Conformation,"Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for which there are no efficacious vaccines or therapeutics that are urgently needed. We expressed three versions of spike (S) proteins--receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit and S ectodomain--in insect cells. RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and S associate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins confer excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in a unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation of coronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ~15 [A] proximal to viral membrane.

1112,Cross-reactive antibody response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections,"The World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has important implications in vaccine development.","Lv, H.; Wu, N.

The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China. Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (OR=1.477, 95%CI:1.069-2.040) were risk factors for GAD, while higher participants self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807, 95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a protective factor. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), longer average working times per week for family members (that is, HCWs) (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029), being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR=3.526, 95%CI:1.609-7.728 and OR=1.639, 95%CI:1.096-2.451, respectively). In addition, compared with participants who were HCWs, participants who were enterprise workers and were more likely to develop depressive symptoms(OR=1.750, 95%CI:1.104-2.776), while who were government employees or institutions employees were less likely to suffer depressive symptoms (OR=0.529, 95%CI:0.286-0.977).

1115,"Structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from 2019-nCoV, a major antiviral drug target","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a global pandemic resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also named nsp12), which catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA, is a key component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug, remdesivir. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of 2019-nCoV full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at a resolution of 2.9-[A]. Additional to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family and a nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain featured in coronaviral RdRp, nsp12 possesses a newly identified {beta}-hairpin domain at its N-terminal. Key residues for viral replication and transcription are observed. A comparative analysis to show how remdesivir binds to this polymerase is also provided. This structure provides insight into the central component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and sheds light on the design of new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral RdRp.

1116,Knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom: A cross-sectional online survey,"Background: Given the extensive time needed to conduct a nationally representative household survey and the commonly low response rate in phone surveys, rapid online surveys may be a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions among the general public during fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks. Objective: To apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among the general public in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to 3,000 adults residing in the US and 3,000 adults residing in the UK who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Strata by age (18 - 27, 28 - 37, 38 - 47, 48 - 57, or >=58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (White, Black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, Mixed, or ""Other""), and all permutations of these strata, were established. The number of participants who could enrol in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrolment into the survey within the strata was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2 2020. Results: 2,986 and 2,988 adults residing in the US and the UK, respectively, completed the questionnaire. 64.4% (1,924/2,986) of US and 51.5% (1,540/2,988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree. 67.5% (2,015/2,986) of US participants had a total household income between $20,000 and $99,999, and 74.4% (2,223/2,988) of UK participants had a total household income between GBP15,000 and GBP74,999. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 5.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of Covid-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI: 36.1% - 39.6%) of US and 29.7% (95% CI: 28.1% - 31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was 'highly effective' in protecting them from acquiring Covid-19. 25.6% (95% CI: 24.1% - 27.2%) of US and 29.6% (95% CI: 28.0% - 31.3%) of UK participants thought it prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8% [95% CI: 52.1% - 55.6%] of US and 39.1% [95% CI: 37.4% - 40.9%] of UK participants) thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media.

1119,Recapitulation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Cholangiocyte Damage with Human Liver Organoids,"The newly emerged pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has posed a significant public health threat worldwide. However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug discovery.","Zhao, B.; Ni, C.; Gao, R.; Wang, Y.; Yang, L.; Wei, J.; Lv, T.; Liang, J.; Zhang, Q.; Xu, W.; Xie, Y.; Wang, X.; Yuan, Z.; Liang, J.; Zhang, R.; Lin, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.990317v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.990317v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,False

In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was excreted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and mucous glands of the nasal cavity. In SARS-CoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes.

Although it is still not fully established if RNA viruses could generate miRNAs that would target their own genes or alter the host gene expression, there are examples of miRNAs functioning as an antiviral defense mechanism. In the case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication, translation and even modulating the host expression. In this study, we performed a machine learning based miRNA prediction analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify miRNA-like hairpins and searched for potential miRNA - based interactions between the viral miRNAs and human genes and human miRNAs and viral genes. Our PANTHER gene function analysis results indicate that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription. For instance, a transcriptional regulator, STAT1 and transcription machinery might be targeted by virus-derived miRNAs. In addition, many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes. Considering the fact that miRNA-based therapies have been successful before, comprehending mode of actions of miRNAs and their possible roles during SARS-CoV-2 infections could create new opportunities for the development and improvement of new therapeutics.","Sacar Demirci, M.

The viral spike protein S binds ACE2 on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses by acting as a decoy for S binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic and prophylactic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S. Mutations are found across the interface, in the N90-glycosylation motif, and at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance folding and presentation of the interaction epitope. When single substitutions are combined, large increases in binding can be achieved. The mutational landscape offers a blueprint for engineering high affinity proteins and peptides that block receptor binding sites on S to meet this unprecedented challenge.","Procko, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.994236v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.994236v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,False
1126,A Cryptic Site of Vulnerability on the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein,"SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that has caused a pandemic of severe respiratory disease--COVID-19-- within several months of its initial identification. Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novel coronaviruss surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus, is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 [A]. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the ""closed"" prefusion S structure, but is accessible in ""open"" conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.

Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a COVID-19 epidemic in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We used a generalized SEIR (Susceptibles, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model, with additional Hospitalized variables (SEIHR model) and age-stratified structure to analyze the expected time evolution during the onset of the epidemic in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. The model allows to determine the evolution of the number of cases, the number of patients admitted to hospitals and deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to investigate the sensibility of our results with respect to parameter estimation errors we performed Monte Carlo analysis with 100 000 simulations by sampling parameter values from an uniform distribution in the confidence interval. Results: We estimate 1 368 (IQR: 880, 2 407) cases, 301 (22%) in older people (more than 60 years), 81 (50, 143) hospitalizations, and 14 (9, 26) deaths in the first 30 days, and 38 583 (IQR: 16 698, 113, 163) cases, 8 427 (21.8%) in older people (more than 60 years), 2181 (914, 6392) hospitalizations, and 397(166, 1205) deaths in the first 60 days. Limitations: We supposed a constant transmission probability Pc among different age-groups, and that every severe and critic case will be hospitalized, as well as that the detection capacity in all the primary healthcare services does not change during the outbreak. Conclusion: Supposing the reported parameters in the literature apply in the city of Sao Paulo, our study shows that it is expected that the impact of a COVID-19 outbreak will be important, requiring special planning from the authorities.

1129,Epidemiological Trends of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China,"Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out in Wuhan, China, and it spread rapidly. Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China. Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic. Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to decrease on the twelfth day, from 3156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China. The battle against this epidemic in China has provided valuable experiences for the rest of the world. Strict measures need to be taken as earlier as possible to prevent its spread.","Lin, B.; Zhong, H.; Ni, Y.; Liu, L.; Zhong, J.; Su, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035642v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035642v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True
1130,Multi-city modeling of epidemics using spatial networks: Application to 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus in India,"The ongoing pandemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity. Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration.","Pujari, B. S.; Shekatkar, S.

1131,Clinical characteristics and durations of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Beijing: a retrospective cohort study,"Background: COVID-19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far. Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Results: Of 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow-up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non-severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10-16.5) and 23 (18-24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, the severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration. Conclusions: COVID-19 has significantly shorter duration of disease and hospital length of stay than SARS. Bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter period of illness onset to admission, lymphopenia, the severity of disease are the risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID-19.","Zhao, W.; Yu, S.; Zha, X.; Wang, N.; Pang, Q.; Li, T.; Li, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035436v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035436v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True
1132,"Assessment of public attention, risk perception, emotional and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 outbreak: social media surveillance in China","Background Using social media surveillance data, this study aimed to assess public attention, risk perception, emotion, and behavioural response to the COVID-19 outbreak in real time. Methods We collected data from most popular social medias: Sina Weibo, Baidu search engine, and Ali e-commerce marketplace, from 1 Dec 2019 to 15 Feb 2020. Weibo post counts and Baidu searches were used to generate indices assessing public attention. Public intention and actual adoption of recommended protection measures or panic buying triggered by rumours and misinformation were measured by Baidu and Ali indices. Qualitative Weibo posts were analysed by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count text analysis programme to assess public emotion responses to epidemiological events, governments' announcements, and control measures. Findings We identified two missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control of the COVID-19 outbreak, one in Dec 2019 and the other between 31 Dec and 19 Jan, when public attention was very low despite the emerging outbreak. Delayed release of information ignited negative public emotions. The public responded quickly to government announcements and adopted recommended behaviours according to issued guidelines. We found rumours and misinformation regarding remedies and cures led to panic buying during the outbreak, and timely clarification of rumours effectively reduced irrational behaviour. Interpretation Social media surveillance can enable timely assessments of public reaction to risk communication and epidemic control measures, and the immediate clarification of rumours. This should be fully incorporated into epidemic preparedness and response systems.

1133,Impact of the contact and exclusion rates on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic,"We constructed a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded model of the spread of COVID-19. The model is parametrised only by the average incubation period, {tau}, and two rate parameters: contact rate, r_E, and exclusion rate, r_E. The rates can be manipulated by non-therapeutic interventions and determine the basic reproduction number, R = r_C/r_E, and, together with {tau}, the daily multiplication coefficient at the early exponential phase, {beta}. Initial {beta} determines the reduction of r_C required to contain epidemic spread. In the long-term, we consider a scenario based on typical social behaviours, in which r_C first decreases in response to a surge of daily new cases, forcing people to self-isolate, and then slowly increases when people gradually accept higher risk. Consequently, initial abrupt epidemic spread is followed by a plateau and slow regression. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, will grant time to develop, produce, and distribute a vaccine, or at least limit daily cases to a manageable number.","Kochanczyk, M.; Grabowski, F.; Lipniacki, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035485v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035485v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True
1134,A high efficient hospital emergency responsive mode is the key of successful treatment of 100 COVID-19 patients in Zhuhai,"Background: Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. The mortality of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases is very high. Facing this kind of public health emergency, high efficient administrative emergency responsive mode in designated hospital is needed. Method: As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital. In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Don't stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we focused on individualized treatment and timely adjustment of treatment and management strategies in working about COVID-19 patients. Results: 1. High working efficiency: By Mar 02, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide consultations and treatment of 366 inpatients, including 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. 2. Excellent therapeutic effectAmong 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, all were cured and discharged, except for one death. No secondary hospital infection, no pipeline infection and no pressure sore were found in all patients. 3. Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 prior to official release conference: Strengthened protection is key point to zero infection in healthcare group and medical faculty and lower rate of second generation infectious patients. 4. Timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update: The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out in our hospital. Conclusions: In our hospital, establishment of NCP department, which is administratively led by the president of hospital directly and specialized conduct by respiratory professor, is the key to success in management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. This hospital emergency responsive mode could provide reference for other hospitals and cities in epidemic situation.","Huang, J.; Li, Z.; Qu, X.; Zheng, X.; Tu, C.; Chen, M.; Tan, C.; Liu, J.; Shan, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20034629v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20034629v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True
1135,Comparative Performance of SARS-CoV-2 Detection Assays using Seven Different Primer/Probe Sets and One Assay Kit,"More than 100,000 people worldwide are known to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 beginning in December 2019. The virus has now spread to over 93 countries including the United States, with the largest cluster of US cases to date in the Seattle metropolitan area in Washington. Given the rapid increase in the number of local cases, the availability of accurate, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing is vital to efforts to manage the current public health crisis. In the course of optimizing SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Lab (UW Virology Lab), we tested assays using seven different primer/probe sets and one assay kit. We found that the most sensitive assays were those the used the E-gene primer/probe set described by Corman et al. (Eurosurveillance 25(3), 2020, https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045) and the N2 set described by the CDC (Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.pdf). All assays tested were found to be highly specific for SARS-CoV-2, with no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses observed in our analyses regardless of the primer/probe set or kit used. These results will provide invaluable information to other clinical laboratories who are actively developing SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols at a time when increased testing capacity is urgently needed worldwide.","Casto, A.

1136,Deep Learning-based Detection for COVID-19 from Chest CT using Weak Label,"Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

1137,Blood single cell immune profiling reveals the interferon-MAPK pathway mediated adaptive immune response for COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an ongoing global health emergence, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. We revealed blood cell immune response profiles using 5' mRNA, TCR and BCR V(D)J transcriptome analysis with single-cell resolution. Data from 134,620 PBMCs and 83,387 TCR and 12,601 BCR clones was obtained, and 56 blood cell subtypes and 23 new cell marker genes were identified from 16 participants. The number of specific subtypes of immune cells changed significantly when compared patients with controls. Activation of the interferon-MAPK pathway is the major defense mechanism, but MAPK transcription signaling is inhibited in cured patients. TCR and BCR V(D)J recombination is highly diverse in generating different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the interferon-MAPK pathway and TCR- and BCR-produced antibodies play important roles in the COVID-19 immune response. Immune deficiency or immune over-response may result in the condition of patients with COVID-19 becoming critical or severe.","Huang, L.; Shi, Y.; Gong, B.; Jiang, L.; Liu, X.; Yang, J.; Tang, J.; You, C.; Jiang, Q.; Long, B.; Zeng, T.; Luo, M.; Zeng, F.; Zeng, F.; Wang, S.; Yang, X.; Yang, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20033472v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20033472v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True
1138,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"Background: The city of Wuhan is the epicenter of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and a central Chinese hub for transportation and industry. Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.","Shi, Z.; Fang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20034199v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20034199v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True

1141,The effects of border control and quarantine measures on global spread of COVID-19,"The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an ""easy-to-use"" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.92 and latent period {tau} = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","Hossain, M.

1142,Impact of city and residential unit lockdowns on prevention and control of COVID-19,"With respect to the asymptomatic transmission characteristics of the novel coronavirus that appeared in 2019 (COVID-19), a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-death (SAIRD) model that considered human mobility was constructed in this study. The dissemination of COVID-19 was simulated using computational experiments to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of city and residential lockdowns on controlling the spread of the epidemic. Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, medical resources should be increased in cities under lockdown. Implementation of these measures would reduce the spread of the virus to other cities and allow appropriate treatment of patients in cities under lockdown.","Shao, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035253v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035253v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True
1143,A Cybernetics-based Dynamic Infection Model for Analyzing SARS-COV-2 Infection Stability and Predicting Uncontrollable Risks,"Since December 2019, COVID-19 has raged in Wuhan and subsequently all over China and the world. We propose a Cybernetics-based Dynamic Infection Model (CDIM) to the dynamic infection process with a probability distributed incubation delay and feedback principle. Reproductive trends and the stability of the SARS-COV-2 infection in a city can then be analyzed, and the uncontrollable risks can be forecasted before they really happen. The infection mechanism of a city is depicted using the philosophy of cybernetics and approaches of the control engineering. Distinguished with other epidemiological models, such as SIR, SEIR, etc., that compute the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population, CDIM considers the immigration and emigration population as system inputs, and administrative and medical resources as dynamic control variables. The epidemic regulation can be simulated in the model to support the decision-making for containing the outbreak. City case studies are demonstrated for verification and validation.","Xiao, W.; Liu, Q.; Huan, J.; Sun, P.; Wang, L.; Zang, C.; Zhu, S.; Gao, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20034082v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20034082v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True
1144,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"This paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in China. We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.","Qiu, Y.; Chen, X.; Shi, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035238v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True

1146,Serological immunochromatographic approach in diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients,"An outbreak of new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other cities and nations. The standard diagnostic approach that widely adopted in the clinic is nuclear acid detection by real-time RT-PCR. However, the false-negative rate of the technique is unneglectable and serological methods are urgently warranted. Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nuclear acid confirmed cases were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1-7 days after onset), intermediate stage (8-14 days after onset), and late-stage (more than 15 days), respectively. The ICG detection capacity in nuclear acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%. In addition, the consistencies of whole blood samples with plasma were 100% and 97.1% in IgM and IgG strips, respectively. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application.","Pan, Y.; Li, X.; Yang, G.; Fan, J.; Tang, Y.; Zhao, J.; Long, X.; Guo, S.; Zhao, Z.; Liu, Y.; Hu, H.; Xue, H.; Li, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035428v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035428v1?rss=1,2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,True

1149,Clinical Characteristics of 34 Children with Coronavirus Disease-2019 in the West of China: a Multiple-center Case Series,"BACKGROUND Up to 9 March, 2020, 109577 patients were diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) globally. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been revealed recently. However, the information of paediatric patients remains unclear. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making. METHODS and FINDINGS This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included. 47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%). Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%), while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%). In addition, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase was increased significantly in 28 patients (82.35%), as well as -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in 25 patients (73.53%). Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82.36%). The typical feature of ground-glass opacity for adults was rare in paediatric patients (2.94%). A late-onset pattern of lesions in lobules were also noticed. Stratified analysis of the clinical features were not performed due to relatively limited samples. CONCLUSIONS Our data presented the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients systemically. The findings offer new insight into the early identification and intervention of paediatric patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, C.; Gu, J.; Chen, Q.; Deng, N.; Li, J.; Huang, L.; Zhou, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034686v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034686v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1150,"Recommendations for standardized management of CML patients in the core epidemic area of COVID-19(Multi-center survey results in Hubei Province, China)","Background Since late December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that began in Wuhan, has become endemic in China and more than 100 countries and regions in the world. There is no report about the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients untill now. We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. Methods In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 . Findings Of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. Only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with COVID-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Interpretation While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak. Patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death.","wang, D.; Guo, J.-M.; Yang, Z.-Z.; You, Y.; Chen, Z.-C.; Chen, S.-M.; Cheng, H.; Zhang, Y.-S.; Jiang, D.-Z.; Zuo, X.-L.; Zhu, X.-J.; Huang, J.; Wang, H.-X.; Li, Q.; Wu, Q.; Huang, Z.-P.; Liu, Q.-H.; Bao, Y.; Zhang, D.-L.; Zhang, X.-H.; Zhao, Z.; Ge, R.-Y.; Du, J.; Wang, Y.-P.; Ren, H.-B.; Han, H.; Wei, Y.-H.; Xiang, H.; Wan, C.-C.; Zhao, Y.-F.; Chen, B.; Yuan, G.-L.; Li, M.; Li, W.-m.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034876v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034876v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1151,Immune phenotyping based on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and IgG predicts disease severity and outcome for patients with COVID-19,"Background: A recently emerging respiratory disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across the world. This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and disease severities were analyzed. Findings: A total of 222 patients were included in this study. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the fourth week. Severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high IgG levels, compared to those who with low IgG levels (51.8% versus 32.3%; p=0.008). Severity rates for patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 72.3%, 48.5%, 33.3%, and 15.6%, respectively (p<0.0001). Furthermore, severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased CD4+ T cell count compared to those with NLRloIgGlo phenotype (p<0.05). Recovery rate for severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 58.8% (20/34), 68.8% (11/16), 80.0% (4/5), and 100% (12/12), respectively (p=0.0592). Dead cases only occurred in NLRhiIgGhi and NLRhiIgGlo phenotypes. Interpretation: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.","Zhang, B.; Zhou, X.; Zhu, C.; Feng, F.; Qiu, Y.; Feng, J.; Jia, Q.; Song, Q.; Zhu, B.; Wang, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20035048v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20035048v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1152,Triaging patients in the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus,"In the end of 2019, the epidemic of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan and spread rapidly. Changsha, a city located south to the epicenter, was soon impacted. To control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were implemented in a local hospital of the city. This retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID-19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. More than 50% of the suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative of the virus infection,188 were successfully revisited and none was reported as a COVID-19 case. Of the eight COVID-19 patients, three were confirmed only after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. Besides comorbidities, delayed sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the diagnosis in practice. While SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is being alerted in many countries, our report will be helpful to other colleagues in rapid identification of COVID-19 cases and controlling the transmission of the disease.","Huang, G.; Zeng, W.; Wang, W.; Song, Y.; Mo, X.; Li, J.; Wu, P.; Wang, R.; Zhou, F.; Wu, J.; Yi, B.; Xiong, Z.; Zhou, L.; Wang, F.; Tian, Y.; Hu, W.; Xu, X.; Zhai, R.; Yuan, K.; Li, X.; Qiu, X.; Qiu, J.; Wang, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035212v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035212v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1153,A Method to Model Outbreaks of New Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential such as COVID-19,"The emergence of the novel coronavirus (a.k.a. COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) out of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China caught the world by surprise. As the outbreak began to spread outside of China, too little was known about the virus to model its transmission with any acceptable accuracy. World governments responded to rampant misinformation about the virus leading to collateral disasters, such as plunging financial markets, that could have been avoided if better models of the outbreak had been available. This is an engineering approach to model the spread of a new infectious disease from sparse data when little is known about the infectious agent itself. The paper is not so much about the model itself - because there are many good scientific approaches to model an epidemic - as it is about crunching numbers when there are barely any numbers to crunch. The coronavirus outbreak in USA is used to illustrate the implementation of this modeling approach. A Monte Carlo approach is implemented by using incubation period and testing efficiency as variables. Among others it is demonstrated that imposing early travel restrictions from infected countries slowed down the outbreak in the USA by about 26 days.","Odendaal, W.

1154,Environmental contamination of the SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare premises: An urgent call for protection for healthcare workers,"Importance A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Participants Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major personal protection equipment (PPE). The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 RNAs Results The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were most contaminated PPE. Conclusions and Relevance Many surfaces were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and PPE. The 13 hospital function zones were classified into four contamination levels. These findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings may have important implications for modifying and developing urgently needed policy to better protect healthcare workers during this ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.","Ye, G.; Lin, H.; Chen, L.; Wang, S.; Zeng, Z.; Wang, W.; Zhang, S.; Rebmann, T.; Li, Y.; Pan, Z.; Yang, Z.; Wang, Y.; Wang, F.; Qian, Z.; Wang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True

Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID-19. IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were remarkably up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19. The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 relative to the length of hospital stay underwent a similar ""rise-decline"" pattern, probably reflecting the therapeutic effect.

1156,Generalized logistic growth modeling of the COVID-19 outbreak in 29 provinces in China and in the rest of the world,"Background: the COVID-19 has been successfully contained in China but is spreading all over the world. We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections. Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population. Conclusions: The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Iran's situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak. Both Europe and the USA are at early stages of the outbreak, posing significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures.","Wu, K.; Darcet, D.; Wang, Q.; Sornette, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034363v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034363v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True

The results showed that blood group A was associated with a higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups. This is the first observation of an association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that this is an early study with limitations. It would be premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time, but it should encourage further investigation of the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19 susceptibility.","Zhao, J.; Yang, Y.; Huang, H.-P.; Li, D.; Gu, D.-F.; Lu, X.-F.; Zhang, Z.; Liu, L.; Liu, T.; Liu, Y.-K.; He, Y.-J.; Sun, B.; Wei, M.-L.; Yang, G.-Y.; Wang, X.; Zhang, L.; Zhou, X.-Y.; Xing, M.-Z.; Wang, P.

1159,Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government intervention on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic,"Background: With new cases of COVID-19 surging around the world, many countries have to prepare for moving beyond the containment phase. Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the ongoing seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to the spread of COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention). Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of rapidly spreading awareness on the use of these self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. In this paper, based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamical models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models on the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy.","Yang, W.; Zhang, D.; Peng, L.; Zhuge, C.; Hong, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034595v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034595v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1161,Impact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 and influenza in Hong Kong: an observational study,"Background: A range of public health measures have been implemented to delay and reduce local transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and there have been major changes in behaviours of the general public. We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of COVID-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20-23 and February 11-14. We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R_t), for COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1). Findings: COVID-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. In the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. Implications: Containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of COVID-19. The social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February 2020. However, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as COVID-19 continues to spread globally.

1162,Evaluating the effect of public health intervention on the global-wide spread trajectory of Covid-19,"As COVID-19 evolves rapidly, the issues the governments of affected countries facing are whether and when to take public health interventions and what levels of strictness of these interventions should be, as well as when the COVID-19 spread reaches the stopping point after interventions are taken. To help governments with policy-making, we developed modified auto-encoders (MAE) method to forecast spread trajectory of Covid-19 of countries affected, under different levels and timing of intervention strategies. Our analysis showed public health interventions should be executed as soon as possible. Delaying intervention 4 weeks after March 8, 2020 would cause the maximum number of cumulative cases of death increase from 7,174 to 133,608 and the ending points of the epidemic postponed from Jun 25 to Aug 22.","Hu, Z.; Ge, Q.; Li, S.; Jin, L.; Xiong, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033639v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033639v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1163,"Influence factors of death risk among COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China: a hospital-based case-cohort study","Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely pandemic all over the world. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death risk among 200 COVID-19 patients. Methods. Two hundred patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. Biochemical indexes on admission were measured and patient's prognosis was tracked. The association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical indexes with death risk was analyzed. Results. Of 200 COVID-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. Besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. At the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5% COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. Older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. Early hospitalization is of great significance to prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of COVID-19 patients.","Fu, L.; Fei, J.; Xiang, H.-X.; Xiang, Y.; Tan, Z.-X.; Li, M.-D.; Liu, F.-F.; Liu, H.-Y.; Zheng, L.; Li, Y.; Zhao, H.; Xu, D.-x.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035329v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035329v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1164,Heat inactivation of serum interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,"The detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis. Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56  prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56  for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56  for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating.","Hu, X.; An, T.; Situ, B.; Hu, Y.; Ou, Z.; Li, Q.; He, X.; Zhang, Y.; Tian, P.; Sun, D.; Rui, Y.; Wang, Q.; Ding, D.; Zheng, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034231v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034231v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1165,Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection,"Background/introduction COVID-19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID-19 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID-19 infection or ICU admission. Results Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID-19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 - 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 - 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 - 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 - 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 - 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 - 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Conclusions Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID-19.","Jain, V.; Yuan, J.-M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1166,"Health, distress, and life satisfaction of people one-month into COVID-19 outbreak in China","Background What are the health and wellbeing conditions of people during the COVID-19 outbreak in China? The epidemiological reports now focus on the confirmed COVID-19 cases, and we aim to assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of public health emergencies into the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to working from home; and 25% suspended working due to the outbreak. Those who suspended working reported worse health conditions by SF12 as well as distress (K6). The severity of the COVID-19 in individuals location predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by the existing chronic health issues and exercising hour of each individual. Interpretation Our findings support the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epistemologically. We need to support especially people who suspended working during the outbreak. Our results also highlight that people who are usually active, as indicated by more exercises, might be more suspectable to wellbeing issues due to the lockdown.

1168,Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus likely to be constrained by climate,"As new cases of COVID-19 are being confirmed pressure is mounting to increase understanding of the factors underlying the spread the disease. Using data on local transmissions until the 23rd of March 2020, we develop an ensemble of 200 ecological niche models to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout a typical climatological year. Although cases of COVID-19 are reported all over the world, most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cool and dry areas. The predecessor SARS-CoV-1 was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks could be expected. According to the models, temperate warm and cold climates are more favorable to spread of the virus, whereas arid and tropical climates are less favorable. However, model uncertainties are still high across much of sub- Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia. While models of epidemic spread utilize human demography and mobility as predictors, climate can also help constrain the virus. This is because the environment can mediate human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and unsuitable climates can cause the virus to destabilize quickly, hence reducing its capacity to become epidemic.","Araujo, M.

1169,Ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of 534 cases of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study,"Objective: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is now pandemic all over the world. Previous study has reported several COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis. However, the complete profiling of COVID-19 related ocular symptoms and diseases are still missing. We aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Results: The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 {+/-} 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms. Notably, a total of 332 COVID-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). In consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. Patients, 60.5% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 67.5% in Tongji Hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion was one of the COVID-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of COVID-19.

1170,Strongly heterogeneous transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China: local and regional variation,"Background The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in the city of Wuhan, China, with a period of rapid initial spread. Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low.

1171,Active or latent tuberculosis increases susceptibility to COVID-19 and disease severity,"Importance: Risk factors associated with COVID-19, the viral pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, in Dec 2019, require clarification so that medical resources can be prioritized for those at highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneumonia at Shenyang Chest Hospital. Setting: Multi-center study involving three primary care hospitals in Shenyang, China. Participants: 86 suspected COVID-19 cases from participating primary-care hospitals in Shenyang. All 36 SARS-CoV-2 +ve cases (based on RT-PCR assay) were included. Disease severity was assessed using the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6). Mean age, 47 years (range: 25-79), gender ratio, 1:1. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRA) were performed using peripheral blood to determine MTB infection. Main Outcome and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were collected. Comparison of MTB infection status between patients with mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Mean age of 36 COVID-19 patients: 47 (range: 25-79); M/F: 18/18; Wuhan/Hubei connection: 42%. Mild/moderate cases: 27 (75%); severe/critical: 9 (25%). MTB infection (IGRA+ve): 13 cases (36.11%), including 7 of 9 severe/critical cases. MTB infection rate: higher in COVID-19 (36.11%) than bacterial pneumonia (20%; p=0.0047) and viral pneumonia patients (16.13%; p=0.024). MTB infection more common than other co-morbidities (36.11% vs diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%). MTB co-infection linked with disease severity (severe/critical 78% vs mild/moderate cases 22%; p=0.0049), and rate of disease progression: infection to development of symptoms (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 6.5+/-4.2 days vs SARS-COV-2: 8.9+/-5.2 days; p=0.073); from symptom development to diagnosed as severe (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 3.4+/-2.0 days vs SARS-COV-2: 7.5+/-0.5 days; p=0.075). Conclusions and Relevance: MTB infection likely increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and increases COVID-19 severity, but this requires validation in a larger study.

Underlying cardiovascular diseases in some patients were hypertension (n=7, 46.6%), coronary heart disease (n=3, 20%) and diabetes (n=3, 20%). The most common symptoms at illness onset in patients with cardiac injury were fever (n=11, 73.3%), cough (n=7, 46.7%), headache or fatigue (n=5, 33.3%) and dyspnoea (n=4, 26.6%). These patients had higher systolic pressures, and lower lymphocyte counts and platelet counts, compared with patients without cardiac injury, respectively. Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and elevated C-reactive protein occurred in all patients with cardiac injury. Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.3%), and receive mechanical ventilation (53.4%), continuous renal replacement therapy (33.3%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (26.7%) and vasopressor therapy (26.7%) and be admitted to the intensive care unit (73.3%). One patient died during the study.

1174,Social distance and SARS memory: impact on the public awareness of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,"This study examines publicly available online search data in China to investigate the spread of public awareness of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. We found that cities that suffered from SARS and have greater migration ties to the epicentre, Wuhan, had earlier, stronger and more durable public awareness of the outbreak. Our data indicate that forty-eight such cities developed awareness up to 19 days earlier than 255 comparable cities, giving them an opportunity to better prepare. This study suggests that it is important to consider memory of prior catastrophic events as they will influence the public response to emerging threats.","Chen, H.; Xu, W.; Paris, C.; Reeson, A.; Li, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033688v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033688v1?rss=1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,,True
1175,Structural and functional conservation of the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift signal of SARS-CoV-2,"17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is highly conserved. In contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.","Kelly, J. A.; Dinman, J.

1176,Reinfection could not occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques,"An outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan and spread globally. Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering. However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of ""relapse"" or ""reinfection"". The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.","Bao, L.; Deng, W.; Gao, H.; Xiao, C.; Liu, J.; Xue, J.; Lv, Q.; Liu, J.; Yu, P.; Xu, Y.; Qi, F.; Qu, Y.; Li, F.; Xiang, Z.; Yu, H.; Gong, S.; Liu, M.; Wang, G.; Wang, S.; Song, Z.; Zhao, W.; Han, Y.; Zhao, L.; Liu, X.; Wei, Q.; Qin, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1?rss=1,2020-03-14,2020-03-14,,False
1177,A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV,"The outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, continues to spread globally, but there is currently very little understanding of the epitopes on the virus. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in complex with CR3022, a neutralizing antibody previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient. CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding site can only be accessed when at least two RBDs on the trimeric S protein are in the ""up"" conformation. Overall, this study provides structural and molecular insight into the antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

1178,The architecture of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3' tail. Functional investigation of the unknown ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

1179,Differential Antibody Recognition by Novel SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domains: Mechanistic Insights,"The appearance of the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 represents a major threat to human health, and its diffusion around the world is causing dramatic consequences. The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system.

Herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells.

1180,High sensitivity detection of SARS-CoV-2 using multiplex PCR and a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method,"Many detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect SARS-CoV-2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth.","Li, C.; Debruyne, D.; Spencer, J.; Kapoor, V.; Liu, L.

1181,Accurate Identification of SARS-CoV-2 from Viral Genome Sequences using Deep Learning,"One of the reasons for the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field. Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. Experiments on data from the Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify SARS-CoV-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and SARS-CoV regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). From a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying SARS-CoV-2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. Then, using the same basis, we classify SARS-CoV-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene ORF1ab from the NCBI with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17%, a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the results allow us to identify base pairs sequences that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and do not appear in other virus strains, that could then be used as a base for designing new primers and examined by experts to extract further insights. These preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for SARS-CoV-2. At this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning, will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. In addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As more data become available we will update our system.","Lopez-Rincon, A.; Tonda, A.; Mendoza-Maldonado, L.; Claassen, E.; Garssen, J.; Kraneveld, A.

SARS-CoV-2 was reported to enter cells via binding to ACE2, followed by its priming by TMPRSS2. Here, we investigate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels and their distribution across cell types in lung tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell RNA sequencing, respectively. While TMPRSS2 is expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches ACE2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. Interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to RHO GTPase function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

1183,Dark proteome of Newly Emerged SARS-CoV-2 in Comparison with Human and Bat Coronaviruses,"Recently emerged coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or Wuhan coronavirus) is a causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is rapidly spreading throughout the world now. More than 9,00,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 47,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted that the COVID-19 is a pandemic now. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied Human SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins were shown to contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners. The results of our extensive investigation of the dark side of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome will have important implications for the structural and non-structural biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.

SignificanceThe infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe respiratory disease with pneumonia-like symptoms in humans is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. No in-depth information on structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is currently available in the public domain, and no effective anti-viral drugs and/or vaccines are designed for the treatment of this infection. Our study provides the first comparative analysis of the order- and disorder-based features of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome relative to human SARS and bat CoV that may be useful for structure-based drug discovery.","Giri, R.; Bhardwaj, T.; Shegane, M.; Gehi, B.

1184,Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV Polymerase,"SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency.1 Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.2 Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3-fluoro-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.","Ju, J.; Li, X.; Kumar, S.; Jockusch, S.; Chien, M.; Tao, C.; Morozova, I.; Kalachikov, S.; Kirchdoerfer, R.; Russo, J.

Here, we reported a research finding that SARS-CoV-2 invaded host cells via a novel route of CD147-spike protein (SP). SP bound to CD147, a receptor on the host cells, thereby mediating the viral invasion. Our further research confirmed this finding. First, in vitro antiviral tests indicated Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 humanized antibody, significantly inhibited the viruses from invading host cells, with an EC50 of 24.86 g/mL and IC50 of 15.16 g/mL. Second, we validated the interaction between CD147 and SP, with an affinity constant of 1.85x10-7M. Co-Immunoprecipitation and ELISA also confirmed the binding of the two proteins. Finally, the localization of CD147 and SP was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells by immuno-electron microscope.

1188,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"Background: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has extended its range of transmission in all parts of the world, with substantial variation in rates of transmission and severity of associated disease. Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to control further spread. Methods: We evaluate whether and under which conditions containment or slowing down COVID-19 epidemics are possible by isolation and contact tracing in settings with various levels of social distancing. We use a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to onset of infectiousness), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Social distancing affects the number of contacts outside but not within the household. Findings: The proportion of asymptomatic or unascertained cases has a strong impact on the controllability of the disease. If the proportion of asymptomatic infections is larger than 30%, contact tracing and isolation cannot achieve containment for an R0 of 2.5. Achieving containment by social distancing requires a reduction of numbers of non-household contacts by around 90%. Depending on the realized level of contact reduction, tracing and isolation of only household contacts, or of household and non-household contacts are necessary to reduce the effective reproduction number to below 1. A combination of social distancing with isolation and contact tracing leads to synergistic effects that increase the prospect of containment. Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to slow down epidemics, but only if the majority of cases are ascertained. In a situation with social distancing, contact tracing can act synergistically and tip the scale towards containment, and can therefore be a tool for controlling COVID-19 epidemics as part of an exit strategy from current lockdown measures.","Kretzschmar, M.

1189,"Epidemiological, Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Medical Staff Infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A Retrospective Case Series Analysis","Backgrounds Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus epidemic has emerged in Wuhan city, China and then rapidly spread to other areas. As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (<= 10 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), subpleural (80%) and ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge. Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge for medical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.","Liu, J.; Ouyang, L.; Guo, P.; Wu, H. s.; Fu, P.; Chen, Y. l.; Yang, D.; Han, X. y.; Cao, Y. k.; Alwalid, O.; Tao, J.; Peng, S. y.; Shi, H. s.; Yang, F.; Zheng, C. s.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033118v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033118v1?rss=1,2020-03-13,2020-03-13,,True
1190,The Prediction for Development of COVID-19 in Global Major Epidemic Areas Through Empirical Trends in China by Utilizing State Transition Matrix Model,"Background: Since pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, tremendous infected cases has risen all over the world attributed to high transmissibility. We managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from Hubei and non-Hubei in China. Methods: We extracted data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in South Korean, Italy, and Iran. Also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine. Results: the optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of -3.87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of -2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. Matching and fitting with these scenarios, the IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6-Mar 12, Italy Mar 10-Mar 24, and Iran is Mar 10-Mar 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy, and 226k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. There should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the IFP will arrive earlier than our estimation. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be higher than predicted above. Conclusion: We can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of COVID-19.","Zheng, Z.; Wu, K.; Yao, Z.; Zheng, J.; Chen, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033670v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033670v1?rss=1,2020-03-13,2020-03-13,,True
1191,Clinical features of imported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in Tibetan patients in the Plateau area,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread throughout China, but the clinical characteristics of Tibetan patients living in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are unknown. We aimed to investigate the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of these patients. We included 67 Tibetan patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of clinical symptoms at admission, with 31 and 36 patients in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, respectively. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics were extracted and analysed. No patient had a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients from Wuhan or had travelled to Wuhan. The mean age of Tibetan patients was 39.3 years and 59% of the patients were male. Seven patients presented with fever on admission and lymphocytopenia was present in 20 patients. 47 patients had abnormal chest CTs at admission instead of stating that 20 were unchanged. Lactate dehydrogenase levels were increased in 31 patients. Seven patients progressed to severe COVID-19; however, after treatment, their condition was stable. No patients died. Of the 36 asymptomatic patients, the mean age was younger than the symptomatic group (34.4vs 44.9 years, P=0.02). Lymphocyte count and prealbumin levels were higher in the asymptomatic group than the group with clinical symptoms (1.6 vs 1.3 and 241.8 vs 191.9, respectively; P<0.05).

1192,Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of pediatric patients during the convalescent phase,"Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified virus which mainly spreads from person-to-person. Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4*109/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","Xing, Y.; Ni, W.; Wu, Q.; Li, W.; Li, G.; Tong, J.; Song, X.; Xing, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20033159v1?rss=1,2020-03-13,2020-03-13,,True
1193,The demand for inpatient and ICU beds for COVID-19 in the US: lessons from Chinese cities,"Background: Sustained spread of SARS-CoV-2 has happened in major US cities. Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. Methods: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations. Conclusion: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system in US cities.","Li, R.; Rivers, C.; Tan, Q.; Murray, M.

1194,Genomic epidemiology of a densely sampled COVID19 outbreak in China,"Analysis of genetic sequence data from the pandemic SARS Coronavirus 2 can provide insights into epidemic origins, worldwide dispersal, and epidemiological history. With few exceptions, genomic epidemiological analysis has focused on geographically distributed data sets with few isolates in any given location. Here we report an analysis of 20 whole SARS-CoV 2 genomes from a single relatively small and geographically constrained outbreak in Weifang, People's Republic of China. Using Bayesian model-based phylodynamic methods, we estimate the reproduction number for the outbreak to be 1.99(95% CI:1.48-3.14). We further estimate the number of infections through time and compare these estimates to confirmed diagnoses by the Weifang Centers for Disease Control. We find that these estimates are consistent with reported cases and there is unlikely to be a large undiagnosed burden of infection over the period we studied.","Volz, E.; Fu, H.; Wang, H.; Xi, X.; Chen, W.; Liu, D.; Chen, Y.; Tian, M.; Tan, W.; Zai, J.; Zan, W.; Li, X.; Nie, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033365v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033365v1?rss=1,2020-03-13,2020-03-13,,True
1195,Modeling the situation of COVID-19 and effects of different containment strategies in China with dynamic differential equations and parameters estimation,"This paper proposed a quarantine-susceptible-exposed-infectious-resistant (QSEIR) model which considers the unprecedented strict quarantine measures in almost the whole of China to resist the epidemic. We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can't be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.","Liu, X.; Hewings, G.

1196,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Background COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.","Bayham, J.; Fenichel, E.

1197,Virus strain of a mild COVID-19 patient in Hangzhou representing a new trend in SARS-CoV-2 evolution related to Furin cleavage site,"We found, in our 788 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the decreased rate of severe/critical type, increased liver/kidney damage and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity during virus dissemination, when compared with Wuhan. To investigate the underlining mechanism, we isolated one strain of SARS- CoV-2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 were both T at these two sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.","Xi, J.; Xu, K.; Jiang, P.; Lian, J.; Hao, S.; Jia, H.; Yao, H.; Zhang, Y.; Zheng, R.; Chen, D.; Yao, J.; Hu, J.; Gao, J.; Shen, J.; Wen, L.; Ren, Y.; Yu, G.; Wang, X.; Lu, Y.; Yu, X.; Yu, L.; Xiang, D.; Zheng, L.; Wu, N.; Lu, X.; Cheng, L.; Liu, F.; Wu, H.; Jin, C.; Yang, X.; Qian, P.; Qiu, Y.; Sheng, J.; Liang, T.; Li, L.; Yang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033944v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033944v1?rss=1,2020-03-13,2020-03-13,,True

A good understanding of the dynamic of the disease would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID-19. However, to the best of our knowledge, the unique features of the outbreak have limited the applications of all existing models. In this paper, a novel stochastic model is proposed which aims to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. We find that, (1) instead of aberration, there is a remarkable amount of asymptomatic individuals, (2) an individual with symptoms is approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic patient, (3) the transmission rate has reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, (4) it is expected that the epidemic outbreak would be contained by early March in the the selected provinces and cities.","Zhang, Y.; You, C.; Cai, Z.; Sun, J.; Hu, W.; Zhou, X.-H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033803v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033803v1?rss=1,2020-03-13,2020-03-13,,True

The case fatality rate is the most direct indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province. Methods We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 from Dec 8, 2019 to Mar 10, 2020 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese authority. The numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates. Results From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.4%19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%96.6%.

1201,Estimates of the severity of COVID-19 disease,"Background: A range of case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for COVID 19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.","Verity, R.; Okell, L.

1203,Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Knowledge and Perceptions: A Survey on Healthcare workers,"Background: During the first week of March, the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reached over 100 countries with more than 100,000 cases. Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%). Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants used social media to obtain information (61%), and a significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19 prevention and control. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19. Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs beyond borders, and further studies are warranted.","Bhagavathula, A. S.; Aldhaleei, W. A.; Rahmani, J.; Mahabadi, M. A.; Bandari, D.

We examined the age distribution of COVID-19 cases in Japan from January to March, 2020. Children are less likely to be diagnosed as cases, and moreover, the risk of disease given exposure among children appears to be low. Both the overall risk and the conditional risk of disease given exposure are likely to be the highest among adults aged from 50-69 years.

1205,Protocol for a randomized controlled trial testing inhaled nitric oxide therapy in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19,"Introduction: the current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health. The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery. Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xi an, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending.

1206,Lessons drawn from China and South Korea for managing COVID-19 epidemic: insights from a comparative modeling study,"We conducted a comparative study of COVID-19 epidemic in three different settings: mainland China, the Guangdong province of China and South Korea, by formulating two disease transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting-specific interventions, and fitting the models to multi-source data to identify initial and effective reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South Korea.","Tang, B.; Xia, F.; Bragazzi, N.

1207,Maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia: a case-control study,"Background The ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy. There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. Conclusion Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.","Li, N.; Han, L.; Peng, M.; Lv, Y.; Ouyang, Y.; Liu, K.; Yue, L.; Li, Q.; Sun, G.; Chen, L.; Yang, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033605v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033605v1?rss=1,2020-03-13,2020-03-13,,True
1208,Protocol of a randomized controlled trial testing inhaled Nitric Oxide in mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).,"Introduction. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) due to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related infection (COVID-19) is characterized by severe ventilation perfusion mismatch leading to refractory hypoxemia. To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown in-vitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic SARS-CoV2. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment. Methods and analysis. Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO (treatment group) or not (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free from hypoxemia for more than 24 hours. The primary outcome evaluates levels of oxygenation between the two groups at 48 hours. Secondary outcomes include rate of survival rate at 28 and 90 days in the two groups, time to resolution of severe hypoxemia, time to achieve negativity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Ethics and dissemination. The study protocol has been approved by the Investigational Review Board of Xijing Hospital (Xian, China) and pending the Partners Human Research Committee (Boston, USA). Recruitment will start after approval of both IRBs and local IRBs at other enrolling centers.

1209,The time scale of asymptomatic transmission affects estimates of epidemic potential in the COVID-19 outbreak,"We assess the impact of asymptomatic transmission on epidemic potential of novel respiratory pathogens (like COVID-19) -- as measured both by the basic reproduction number (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R_0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R_0 will be under-estimated. We also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease. Our analysis provides a rationale for assessing the duration of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in addition to their prevalence in the population.","Park, S. W.; Cornforth, D.

1210,Analysis clinical features of COVID-19 infection in secondary epidemic area and report potential biomarkers in evaluation,"Objective: Based on the clinical characteristics of infected patients with novel coronavirus in secondary epidemic areas,we aimed to identify potential biomarkers for the evaluation of novel coronavirus-infected patients,guide the diagnosis and treatment of this disease in secondary epidemic areas and provide a reference for the clinical prevention and control of this epidemic situation. Methods: The clinical data of 33 patients with respiratory symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus in Wenzhou city from January 15 to February 12,2020,were thoroughly reviewed. At the onset of the disease,we found that the primary symptoms were fever,cough,fatigue,chest tightness,chest pain and specific blood test results. According to the patients'histories,the patients were divided into two groups: those who spent time in the main epidemic area and those who did not spend time in the main epidemic area. The differences in the clinical manifestations between these two groups were analyzed. Results: The main clinical symptoms of patients infected with novel coronavirus in the secondary epidemic area were respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms. After grouping patients based on the presence or absence of residency in or travel history to the main epidemic area, there was no significant difference between the baseline data of these two groups, and there were no significant differences in symptoms and signs between the two groups (P>0.05). Some patients had abnormally increased serum amyloid protein A (SAA). There were statistically significant differences in the leukocyte count/C-reactive protein,monocyte ratio/C-reactive protein,neutrophil count/C-reactive protein,monocyte count/C-reactive protein and hemoglobin/C-reactive protein values between the two groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms were the primary symptoms of novel coronavirus infection in the secondary epidemic area; these symptoms are not typical. The abnormal increase in serum amyloid protein (SAA) may be used as an auxiliary index for diagnosis and treatment. CRP changes before other blood parameters and thus may be an effective evaluation index for patients with COVID-19 infection.","Ji, W.; Bishnu, G.; Cai, Z.; Shen, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033613v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033613v1?rss=1,2020-03-13,2020-03-13,,True

We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19. Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients. Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long.

1213,"The effect of control strategies that reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China","BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. However, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.","Prem, K.; Liu, Y.; Russell, T.; Kucharski, A.

1214,Quantifying dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests that epidemic control and avoidance is feasible through instantaneous digital contact tracing,"The newly emergent human virus SARS-CoV-2 is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems. Preventing further transmission is a priority. We analysed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines ('lock-downs') that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.","Ferretti, L.; Wymant, C.; Kendall, M.; Zhao, L.; Nurtay, A.; Bonsall, D.

1215,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (previously 2019-nCoV) by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging SARSr-CoVs.","Xia, S.; Liu, M.; Wang, C.; Xu, W.; Lan, Q.; Feng, S.; Qi, F.; Bao, L.; Du, L.; Liu, S.; Qin, C.; Sun, F.; Shi, Z.; Zhu, Y.; Jiang, S.; Lu, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983247v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.983247v1?rss=1,2020-03-12,2020-03-12,,False
1216,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"Australia implemented a travel ban on China on February 1st 2020. Partial lifting of the ban is being considered, given the decline in incidence of COVID-19 in China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic. The epidemic is still containable if other measures are used in tandem as cases surge in other countries. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.","Costantino, V.; Heslop, D. J.; MacIntyre, C.

1217,"Early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: single-center experience from Wuhan, China","Background: Severe patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure. We aimed to evaluate the definite efficacy and safety of corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Forty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared. Results: A total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06 {+/-} 0.28 vs. 5.29 {+/-} 0.70, P=0.010). The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P<0.001). In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with administration of methylprednisolone. Conclusion: Our data indicate that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid was associated with a faster improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus.","Wang, Y.; Jiang, W.; He, Q.; Wang, C.; Wang, B.; Zhou, P.; Dong, N.; Tong, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032342v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032342v1?rss=1,2020-03-12,2020-03-12,,True
1218,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in adolescents and young adults,"Background: Adolescents and young adults might play a key role in the worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), because they are more involved in overseas studying, business, working, and travelling. However, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of them are still unknown. Methods: We collected data of 46 confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 10 to 35 years from the study hospital. The demographics, epidemiological, and clinical data were collected. Several key epidemiological parameters, the asymptomatic cases and transmission to their family members and the clinical characteristics at admission, and during treatment were summarized. RESULTS: Of 46 confirmed patients, 14 patients (47.3%) were aged from 10 to 24 years, and 24 (52.7%) patients were male. The mean incubation period for symptomatic cases was 6.6 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4 - 9.6). The median serial interval was 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4 - 6.2). Three of asymptomatic cases showed the transmission to their family members. Only 1 patient was identified as severe cases at admission. The common symptoms at admission were dry cough (34, 91.0%), and fever (29, 69.0%). Nearly 60% of the patients had showed ground-glass opacity by chest CT findings. Three patients developed acute kidney injury during treatment. Majority of patients (78.3%) were discharged by the end of the follow-up. Conclusions: The adolescent and young adult patients of COVID-19 had a long incubation period, and a short serial interval. The transmission to their family contactors occurred in asymptomatic cases.

1219,The inhaled corticosteroid ciclesonide blocks coronavirus RNA replication by targeting viral NSP15,"Steroid compounds, which are expected to have dual functions in blocking host inflammation and MERS-CoV replication, were screened from a chemical library. Within this library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus. The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) replication (EC90) was 6.3 M. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering MERS or COVID-19.","Matsuyama, S.; Kawase, M.; Nao, N.; Shirato, K.; Ujike, M.; Kamitani, W.; Shimojima, M.; Fukushi, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.987016v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.987016v1?rss=1,2020-03-12,2020-03-12,,False
1220,"Novel and potent inhibitors targeting DHODH, a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, are broad-spectrum antiviral against RNA viruses including newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2","Emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses occasionally cause epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to COVID-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.","Xiong, R.; Zhang, L.; Li, S.; Sun, Y.; Ding, M.; Wang, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Wu, Y.; Shang, W.; Jiang, X.; Shan, J.; Shen, Z.; Tong, Y.; Xu, L.; Chen, Y.; Liu, Y.; Zou, G.; Lavillete, D.; Zhao, Z.; Wang, R.; Zhu, L.; Xiao, G.; Lan, K.; Li, H.; Xu, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.983056v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.983056v1?rss=1,2020-03-12,2020-03-12,,False
1221,Discovery of a 382-nt deletion during the early evolution of SARS-CoV-2,"To date, the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been considered genetically more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Here we report a 382-nt deletion covering almost the entire open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients in Singapore. The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population [1], and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus [2]. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation [1]. We therefore hypothesise that the major deletion revealed in this study may lead to an attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2.","Su, Y.; Anderson, D.; Young, B.; Zhu, F.; Linster, M.; Kalimuddin, S.; Low, J.; Yan, Z.; Jayakumar, J.; Sun, L.; Yan, G.; Mendenhall, I.; Leo, Y.-S.; Lye, D.; Wang, L.-F.; Smith, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.987222v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.987222v1?rss=1,2020-03-12,2020-03-12,,False
1222,"Revealing the influence of national public health policies for the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Wuhan, China through status dynamic modeling","Background The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on Nov. 29th, 2019. There had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number R_0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas R_0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. The peak point is Feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is Jun. 17th, 2020. In total, 77,453 people will be infected. If lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. A delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. Doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. Last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually. Interpretation Our model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan was Feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in Wuhan is now under control. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. Multiple countries including South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Our study, which simulated the epidemic in Wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against SARS-CoV-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations.","qiu, t.; Xiao, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032995v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032995v1?rss=1,2020-03-12,2020-03-12,,True

1224,A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19,"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.","Ge, Y.; Tian, T.; Huang, S.; Wan, F.; Li, J.; Li, S.; Yang, H.; Hong, L.; Wu, N.; Yuan, E.; Cheng, L.; Lei, Y.; Shu, H.; Feng, X.; Jiang, Z.; Chi, Y.; Guo, X.; Cui, L.; Xiao, L.; Li, Z.; Yang, C.; Miao, Z.; Tang, H.; Chen, L.; Zeng, H.; Zhao, D.; Zhu, F.; Shen, X.; Zeng, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.986836v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.986836v1?rss=1,2020-03-12,2020-03-12,,False
1225,The SARS-CoV-2 exerts a distinctive strategy for interacting with the ACE2 human receptor,"The COVID-19 disease has plagued over 110 countries and has resulted in over 4,000 deaths within 10 weeks. We compare the interaction between the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to SARS-CoV. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition. We postulate that the versatility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications on therapeutic strategies.

1228,Effects of Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion and deterioration of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in China,"Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of new type of coronavirus named COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Methods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed. Results: The quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China. Conclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia.

Compared with mild patients (n = 44), severe or critical patients (n = 25) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR, 58-79] vs. 49 years [IQR, 36-60]; P < 0.01). Fever was present in 98.6% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (62.3%), fatigue (58.0%), sputum (39.1%), and headache (33.3%). The median incubation period was 4 days (IQR, 2 to 7). Leukocyte count was 74.1% of normal controls and lymphocyte count was 45.9% of normal controls. The phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) observed in severe or critical cases in 100%. Levels of lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 were showed significant differences between mild and severe or critical cases. Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy patterns (49.3%), local patchy shadowing (29.0%), and ground glass opacity (21.7%). 7.3% patients were diagnosed ARDS, 7.3% patients were diagnosed acute cardiac injury (troponin I >28 pg/mL) and 4.4% patients were diagnosed fungal infections or shock. 4.3% patients have been discharged; 1.5% patient had died; 1.5% patient had recovery.

1232,Estimation of incubation period distribution of COVID-19 using disease onset forward time: a novel cross-sectional and forward follow-up study,"Background: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across countries and become a global crisis. However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. Interpretation: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.","Jing, Q.; You, C.; Lin, Q.; Hu, T.; Yu, S.; Zhou, X.-H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032417v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032417v1?rss=1,2020-03-10,2020-03-10,,True
1233,A retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in 26 children,"Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in December 2019. Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were less based on pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. Method: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results, chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19(ie, with samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019-nCoV]) who were admitted to Shenzhen Center of National Infectious Disease Clinical Medical Research from January 16 to February 8, 2020. Result: Nine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever. Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two), diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases. According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8 patients had no pulmonary infiltration. No serious complications such as acute respiratory syndrome and acute lung injury occurred in all patients. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children were different from adult. The overall condition of children were mild and have a good prognosis.","Tang, A.; Xu, W.; shen, m.; Chen, P.; Li, G.; Liu, Y.; Liu, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.20029710v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.20029710v1?rss=1,2020-03-10,2020-03-10,,True
1234,Mortality of COVID-19 is Associated with Cellular Immune Function Compared to Immune Function in Chinese Han Population,"In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. In this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). the mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8(IQR, 0.6-1.1)109/L in Wuhan, 1.0(IQR, 0.7-1.4)109/L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 109/L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality. Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3+ lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm3, CD4+ lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm3, and CD8+ lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm3.","Zeng, Q.; Li, Y.-z.; Huang, G.; Wu, W.; Dong, S.-y.; Xu, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.20031229v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.20031229v1?rss=1,2020-03-10,2020-03-10,,True
1235,Analysis of early renal injury in COVID-19 and diagnostic value of multi-index combined detection,"Objectives The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19. Design The study was an observational, descriptive study. Setting This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants 12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. Results While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. Conclusions Early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.","Hong, X.-w.; Chi, Z.-p.; Liu, G.-y.; Huang, H.; Guo, S.-q.; Fan, J.-r.; Lin, X.-w.; Qu, L.-z.; Chen, R.-l.; Wu, L.-j.; Wang, L.-y.; Zhang, Q.-c.; Wu, S.-w.; Pan, Z.-q.; Lin, H.; Zhou, Y.-h.; Zhang, Y.-h.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032599v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032599v1?rss=1,2020-03-10,2020-03-10,,True
1236,Analytical sensibility and specificity of two RT-qPCR protocols for SARS-CoV-2 detection performed in an automated workflow,"The World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the development of reliable laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 became mandatory to identify, isolate and provide optimized care for patients early. RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population. The use of the synthetic RT-qPCR target to investigate novel assays diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats.

1239,Clinical Characteristics of 2019 Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19): An Updated Systematic Review,"OBJECTIVE Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) have been described in numerous studies but yielded varying results. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).

1241,In silico Design of novel Multi-epitope recombinant Vaccine based on Coronavirus surface glycoprotein,"It is of special significance to find a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can induce T cell and B cell -mediated immune responses. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. In this project, a novel multi-epitope vaccine for COVID-19 virus based on surface glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. At the first, seventeen potent linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The ability of the selected epitopes to induce interferon-gamma was evaluate using IFNepitope web server. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Three-dimensional structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular docking studies with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules. The results proposed that the multi-epitope vaccine with 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 was a stable construct with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity.","Behbahani, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.985499v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.985499v1?rss=1,2020-03-10,2020-03-10,,False
1242,Aerodynamic Characteristics and RNA Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol in Wuhan Hospitals during COVID-19 Outbreak,"BackgroundThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.

MethodsThirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.

ResultsThe ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow.

ConclusionsRoom ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Liu, Y.; Ning, Z.; Chen, Y.; Guo, M.; Liu, Y.; Gali, N.

1243,A proposal of an alternative primer for the ARTIC Network's multiplex PCR to improve coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing,"A group of biologists, ARTIC Network, has proposed a multiplexed PCR primer set for whole-genome analysis of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, soon after the start of COVID-19 epidemics was realized. The primer set was adapted by many researchers worldwide and has already contributed to the high-quality and prompt genome epidemiology of this rapidly spreading viral disease. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set amplifies all desired 98 PCR amplicons with fairly small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we also observed an acute drop of reads derived from some amplicons especially amplicon 18 and 76 in ""pool 2"" as a samples viral load decreases. We suspected this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers targeting those two amplicons. Indeed, replacement of just one of those primers, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, to a newly designed primer resulted in a drastic improvement of coverages at both regions targeted by the amplicons 18 and 76. Given this result, we further replaced four primers in ""pool 1"" with each respective alternative. These modifications also improved coverage in eight amplicons particularly in samples with low viral load. The results of our experiments clearly indicate that primer dimer formation is one critical cause of coverage bias in ARTIC protocol. Importantly, some of the problematic primers are detectable by observing primer dimers in raw NGS sequence reads and replacing them with alternatives as shown in this study. We expect a continuous improvement of the ARTIC primer set will extend the limit for completion of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to samples with lower viral load, that supports better genomic epidemiology and mitigation of spread of this pathogen.","Itokawa, K.; Sekizuka, T.; Hashino, M.; Tanaka, R.; Kuroda, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.985150v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.985150v1?rss=1,2020-03-10,2020-03-10,,False
1244,In silico approach to accelerate the development of mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods for detection of viral proteins: Application to COVID-19,"We describe a method for rapid in silico selection of diagnostic peptides from newly described viral pathogens and applied this approach to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. This approach is multi-tiered, beginning with compiling the theoretical protein sequences from genomic derived data. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 we begin with 496 peptides that would be produced by proteolytic digestion of the viral proteins. To eliminate peptides that would cause cross-reactivity and false positives we remove peptides from consideration that have sequence homology or similar chemical characteristics using a progressively larger database of background peptides. Using this pipeline, we can remove 47 peptides from consideration as diagnostic due to the presence of peptides derived from the human proteome. To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets. Finally, we leverage publicly deposited proteomics data from human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as a second study with the closely related MERS-CoV to identify the two proteins of highest abundance in human infections. The resulting final list contains the 24 peptides most unique and diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These peptides represent the best targets for the development of antibodies are clinical diagnostics. To demonstrate one application of this we model peptide fragmentation using a deep learning tool to rapidly generate targeted LCMS assays and data processing method for detecting CoVID-19 infected patient samples.

1245,Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection by Detection of Nucleocapsid Protein,"BACKGROUND Nucleic acid test and antibody assay have been employed in the diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the use of viral antigen for diagnosis has not been successfully developed. Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method.

1250,"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Acute Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Wuhan, China","Background A novel coronavirus (SARA-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Within a few weeks, the disease caused by SARA-CoV-2, which is named COVID-19, has escalated into an unprecedented ongoing outbreak with frightening speed, becoming a global health emergency. This study aimed to exam the prevalence and risk factors of acute posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese people shortly after the massive outbreak of COVID-19. Method An online anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted in mainland China between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey consisted of two self-administered questionnaires: one was designed to require personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent exposure history of Wuhan, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), which was to assess PTSS referring to the outbreak. Results A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSS among the public in mainland China 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p < 0.001), exposure history of Wuhan (p = 0.047), classification of population (p < 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001) could be regarded as predictor factors for PTSS. Conclusions The results showed that some Chinese showed acute PTSS during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, comprehensive psychological intervention needs further implementation. Furthermore, females, people who having recent exposure history of Wuhan, those at high risk of infection or with poor sleep quality deserve special attention.","Sun, L.; Sun, Z.; Wu, L.; Zhu, Z.; Zhang, F.; Shang, Z.; Jia, Y.; Gu, J.; Zhou, Y.; Wang, Y.; Liu, N.; Liu, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032425v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032425v1?rss=1,2020-03-10,2020-03-10,,True

1252,Clinical Characteristics of Two Human to Human Transmitted Coronaviruses: Corona Virus Disease 2019 versus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.,"After the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide in 2012. Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused global panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication.

1254,SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment.,"SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate type-I Interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment. Examining transcriptional factor activation and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) induction, SARS-CoV-2 in the context of type I IFN induces phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased ISG proteins. In contrast, the original SARS-CoV has no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation or ISG protein increases even in the presence of type I IFN pretreatment. Next, we examined IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells finding SARS-CoV-2 had reduced viral replication relative to SARS-CoV and induced STAT1 phosphorylation late during infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the IFN-I response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.

ImportanceWith the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 disease, differences between the SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment options. In addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development as well as further research into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates the type I IFN response early during infection.","Lokugamage, K.

1255,Sensitive one-step isothermal detection of pathogen-derived RNAs,"The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast, simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent the spread of diseases. We have developed a SENsitive Splint-based one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR) method for rapid and straightforward onsite detection of pathogen RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times.","Woo, C.

The extracted data includes clinical symptoms, age, gender, sample size and region et al were systematic reviewed and meta analyzed. Results: 14 eligible studies including 1,424 patients were analyzed. Symptoms like fever (89.2%), cough (67.2%), fatigue (43.6%) were common, dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and conjunctival congestion/conjunctivitis were rare. Polypnea/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than non-severe (42.7% vs.16.3%, P<0.0001). Fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients(p=0.0374and0.0267). Further meta-analysis showed incidence of fever(OR1.70,95%CI 1.01-2.87), polypnea/dyspnea(OR3.53, 95%CI 1.95-6.38) and diarrhea(OR1.80,95%CI 1.06-3.03) was higher in severe patients, which meant the severe risk of patients with fever, polypnea/dyspnea, diarrhea were 1.70, 3.53, 1.80 times higher than those with no corresponding symptoms.

1257,Evaluating the secondary transmission pattern and epidemic prediction of the COVID-19 in metropolitan areas of China,"Understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is crucial for evaluating its spread pattern, especially in metropolitan areas of China, as its spread can lead to secondary outbreaks outside Wuhan, the center of the new coronavirus disease outbreak. In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities outside China with emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began January 23~24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was 2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was approximately 466 with a peak time of February 29, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the peak number of cases would differ by between 56% and ~159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further spread but that the risk will increase when businesses and social activities return to normal before the end of the epidemic. Besides, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China are potential to provide evidences supporting for other metropolitan areas and big cities with emerging cases outside China.","Hong, N.; He, J.; Ma, Y.; Jiang, H.; Han, L.; Su, L.; Zhu, W.; Long, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032177v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032177v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,True
1258,The prevalence and influencing factors for anxiety in medical workers fighting COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional survey,"Abstract: Background: The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus has been sustained in China since December 2019, and could become a pandemic if we do not contain it. The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th February 2020 to 20th February 2020 in China using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal ([&le;]49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety ([&ge;]70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Results: Of 512 medical staff from China, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact ({beta}value=2.33, CI: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068). Similar things were observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China ({beta}value=3.67, CI: 1.44 -5.89; p=0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases ({beta}value=4.44, CI: 1.55 -7.33; p=0.0028). Conclusion: Our results highlight that government authorities should make early detection of the high risk of anxiety among medical staff a priority, and implement appropriate psychological intervention programs, to prevent medical staff from developing psychological disorders that could potentially exert an adverse effect on combating the COVID-19 epidemic.","Liu, C.; Yang, Y.-z.; Zhang, X.

1260,Role of temperature and humidity in the modulation of the doubling time of COVID-19 cases,"COVID-19 is having a great impact on public health, mortality and economy worldwide, in spite of the efforts to prevent its epidemy. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","Oliveiros, B.; Caramelo, L.; Ferreira, N.

We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.","Rut, W.; Groborz, K.; Zhang, L.; Sun, X.; Zmudzinski, M.; Hilgenfeld, R.; Drag, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.981928v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.981928v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,False
1264,COVID-19 early warning score: a multi-parameter screening tool to identify highly suspected patients,"BACKGROUND Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide. Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P < 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P < 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P < 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P < 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, and so on. CONCLUSIONS The new developed COVID-19 EWS was a considerable tool for early and relatively accurately warning of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","Song, C.-Y.; Xu, J.; He, J.-Q.; Lu, Y.-Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031906v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031906v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,True
1265,Estimating the generation interval for COVID-19 based on symptom onset data,"Background: Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the COVID-19 outbreak is quintessential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies. Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Conclusions: Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is essential for correctly estimating these quantities.","Ganyani, T.; Kremer, C.; Chen, D.; Torneri, A.; Faes, C.; Wallinga, J.; Hens, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031815v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031815v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,True
1266,CORONAVIRUS IN PREGNANCY AND DELIVERY: RAPID REVIEW AND EXPERT CONSENSUS,"BACKGROUND Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date. The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19.","Mullins, E.; Evans, D.; Viner, R.; O'Brien, P.; Morris, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032144v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032144v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,True
1267,Emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and nursing college students during COVID-19 outbreak,"Background: Affected by a Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, Since December 2019, there have been more than 76,000 cases of COVID-19 in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. The closer COVID-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. Compared with Nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use Problem-focused coping. People may have a cycle of ""the more fear, the more problem-focused coping"". And people may ""The more angry, the more emotion-focused coping"", ""the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry, the more sadness"". Conclusion: COVID-19 is a pressure source with great influence, both for individuals and for the social public groups. Different individuals and groups may experience different levels of psychological crisis, and those nurses at the core of the incident are affected. Hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses and providing timely psychological assistance and training in coping strategies. Improving nurses' ability to regulate emotions and effective coping strategies, providing a strong guarantee for resolutely winning the battle against epidemic prevention and control.","Huang, L.; xu, F. m.; Liu, H. r.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031898v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031898v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,True
1268,Transmission of corona virus disease 2019 during the incubation period may lead to a quarantine loophole,"Background: The ongoing outbreak of novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, is arousing international concern. This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others. Methods: We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. Results: The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1{+/-}3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period. Conclusions: The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole. Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.","Xia, W.; Liao, J.; Li, C.; Li, Y.; Qian, X.; Sun, X.; Xu, H.; Mahai, G.; Zhao, X.; Shi, L.; Liu, J.; Yu, L.; Wang, M.; Wang, Q.; Namat, A.; Li, Y.; Qu, J.; Liu, Q.; Lin, X.; Cao, S.; Huan, S.; Xiao, J.; Ruan, F.; Wang, H.; Xu, Q.; Ding, X.; Fang, X.; Qiu, F.; Ma, J.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, A.; Xing, Y.; Xu, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20031955v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20031955v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,True
1269,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.","Peak, C.

1270,A data-driven assessment of early travel restrictions related to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 within mainland China,"Two months after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has already spread worldwide. However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.","Aleta, A.; Hu, Q.; Ye, J.; Ji, P.; Moreno, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031740v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031740v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,True
1271,A preliminary study on serological assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 238 admitted hospital patients,"Background The outbreak of the recently emerged novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a challenge for public health laboratories. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens. Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay. Keywords.

1272,The Impact of Host-Based Early Warning on Disease Outbreaks,"Objective: The detection of communicable pathogens responsible for major outbreaks relies on health care professionals recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods: We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. Results: For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Conclusions: Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation.","Hernandez, M.; Milechin, L.

1273,The Evaluation of Sleep Disturbances for Chinese Frontline Medical Workers Under the Outbreak of COVID-19,"Objective To evaluate sleep disturbances of Chinese frontline medical workers (fMW) under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, and make a comparison with non-fMW. Methods The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, were volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status of fMW. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>7 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted. Results A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 vs 7.5, P<0.001), AIS (6.9 vs 5.3, P<0.001), anxiety (4.9 vs 4.3, P<0.001) and depression (4.1 vs 3.6, P=0.001), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (67.2% vs 47.7%, P<0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%, P<0.001). In subgroup analysis, compared to male fMW, female fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.4 vs 8.6, P=0.022) and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 7 points (70.3% vs 54.6%, P<0.001).

1274,Clinical presentation and virological assessment of hospitalized cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in a travel-associated transmission cluster,"Background: In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), current case definitions presume mainly lower respiratory tract infection. However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.","Woelfel, R.; Corman, V.

This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model. Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: <= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: >= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: <= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: >= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups ({chi}2 = 4.99 x 10-6, P > 0.999), and five age groups ({chi}2 = 4.85 x 10-6, P > 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons).

Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result. Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had NO GGO or consolidation. The other rare CT symptoms were pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7% prevalence, respectively. The most prevalent event was Either GGO or consolidation in 85% of patients. Conclusion: The most CT-scan abnormality is Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation however in few patients none of them might be observed, so trusting in just CT findings will lead to miss some patients.","Vaseghi, G.; Mansourian, M.; Karimi, R.; Heshmat-Ghahdarijani, K.; Baradaran Mahdavi, S.; Pezeshki, A.; Ataei, B.; Zandifar, A.; Shafaat, O.; Haghjoo Javanmard, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031518v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031518v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,True

We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.","Xu, H.; Hou, K.; Xu, H.; Li, Z.; Chen, H.; Zhang, N.; Xu, R.; Fu, H.; Sun, R.; Wen, L.; Xie, L.; Liu, H.; Zhang, K.; Selvanayagam, J.

1278,"Estimating the scale of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States: Simulations Based on Air Traffic directly from Wuhan, China","Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been characterized by rapid spread and unusually large case clusters. It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to develop informed public health strategies. Methods: We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. We. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S. Results: With the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474). Conclusion: Our research indicates that, as of 03/01/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the situation becomes clearer.","Li, D.; Lv, J.; Botwin, G.; Braun, J.; Cao, W.; Li, L.; McGovern, D. P.

Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 160 protocols. For protocols of TCM clinical trials, 76 outcomes from 16 outcome domains were reported, and almost half (34/76, 44.74%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turns to negative. 27 (27/76, 35.53%) outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 10 outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. For protocols of western medicine clinical trials, 126 outcomes from 17 outcome domains were reported; almost half (62/126, 49.21%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was proportion of patients with negative SARS-CoV-2. 27 outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 40 (40/126, 31.75%) outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. Conclusion: Outcome reporting in protocols of clinical trials of COVID-19 is inconsistent. Thus, developing a core outcome set is necessary.

1280,"Exploring diseases/traits and blood proteins causally related to expression of ACE2, the putative receptor of 2019-nCov: A Mendelian Randomization analysis","The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has caused major outbreaks in many parts of the world. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis. In conclusion, the current MR analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect ACE2 expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. The proteome-wide MR analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. Nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses.","Rao, S.; Lau, A.; So, H.-C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031237v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031237v1?rss=1,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,,True
1281,Cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein provides insights into an evolution of unique coronavirus spike proteins,"The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by a novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has aroused great public health concern. Coronavirus has a history of causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 [A]. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity, which will facilitate to vaccine development.","Ouyang, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.976258v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.976258v1?rss=1,2020-03-07,2020-03-07,,False
1282,"In silico study of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2: similarity with SARS-CoV, hot-spot analysis and effect of the receptor polymorphism","The spread of the COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with the phylogeny analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of human engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.","Othman, H.; Bouslama, Z.; Brandenburg, J.-T.; da Rocha, J.; Hamdi, Y.; Ghedira, K.; Abid, N.-S.; Hazelhurst, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.976027v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.976027v1?rss=1,2020-03-07,2020-03-07,,False

By using genomic, sequence, structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha- and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.","Tan, Y.; Schneider, T.; Leong, M.; Aravind, L.; Zhang, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.977736v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.977736v1?rss=1,2020-03-07,2020-03-07,,False
1285,Genome-wide data inferring the evolution and population demography of the novel pneumonia coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2),"Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Central China and rapidly spread throughout China. Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80 haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the view, pangolin acted as an intermediate host, may be controversial. The network indicated that, in the original haplotype (H14), one patient sample lived near the Huanan seafood market (approximate 2 km), indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. However, based on this clue, we cannot accurately concluded that whether this market was the origin center of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 16 genomes, collected from this market, assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term and then leading to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other areas. The EBSP results showed that the first estimated expansion date of SARS-CoV-2 began from 7 December 2019, which may indicated that the transmission could have begun from person to person in mid to late November.","Shu, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.976662v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.976662v1?rss=1,2020-03-07,2020-03-07,,False

However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 [A] crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the {beta}-sheet core.

1287,Monoclonal antibodies for the S2 subunit of spike of SARS-CoV cross-react with the newly-emerged SARS-CoV-2,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, at the end of 2019 has resulted in widespread human infections across the globe. While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19.","Zheng, Z.; Monteil, V.

Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.","Pfaender, S.; Mar, K.

1290,Estimating the burden of United States workers exposed to infection or disease: a key factor in containing risk of COVID-19 infection,"Introduction: With the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of disease. Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: To estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus. Results: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). Conclusions: The large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","Baker, M.

1291,The potential role of IL-6 in monitoring coronavirus disease 2019.,"Abstract. Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.","Liu, T.; Zhang, J.; Yang, Y.; Zhang, L.; Ma, H.; Li, Z.; Zhang, J.; Cheng, J.; Zhang, X.; Wu, G.; Yi, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1292,Modelling-based evaluation of the effect of quarantine control by the Chinese government in the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over China and across the world. By the end of February 2020, the epidemic outside Hubei province in China has been well controlled, yet the next wave of transmission in other countries may have just begun. A retrospective modeling of the transmission dynamics would provide insights into the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and evaluation of the effectiveness of the strict measures that have been taken by central and local governments of China. Using a refined susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission model and a new strategy of model fitting, we were able to estimate model parameters in a dynamic manner. The resulting parameter estimation can well reflect the prevention policy scenarios. Our simulation results with different degrees of government control suggest that the strictly enforced quarantine and travel ban have significantly decreased the otherwise uncontrollable spread of the disease. Our results suggest similar measures should be considered by other countries that are of high risk of COVID-19 outbreak.","Zhou, X.; Wu, Z.; Yu, R.; Cao, S.; Fang, W.; Jiang, Z.; Yuan, F.; Yan, C.; Chen, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030445v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030445v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1293,"Clinical findings in critical ill patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Guangdong Province, China: a multi-center, retrospective, observational study","Abstract Background In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of February 28th 2020, only one patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of ICU. Conclusions Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction. Compared with critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the mortality of critically ill patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low. These data provide some general understandings and experience for the critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan.","Xu, Y.; Xu, Z.; Liu, X.; Cai, L.; Zheng, H.; Huang, Y.; Zhou, L.; Huang, L.; Lin, Y.; Deng, L.; Li, J.; Chen, S.; Liu, D.; Lin, Z.; Zhou, L.; He, W.; Liu, X.; Li, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030668v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030668v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True

1295,Immunodepletion with Hypoxemia: A Potential High Risk Subtype of Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Background The outbreak of COVID-2019 is becoming a global public health emergency. Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and we determined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD16+56+ NK cells) in different time points. Nanopore Targeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis. Results Apart from the clinical features described previously4, we found that four patients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during the hospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, all patients died. Conclusions We discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019. Hypoxemia severity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which revealing that immunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype of COVID-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.","Yu, L.; Tong, Y.; Shen, G.; Fu, A.; Lai, Y.; Zhou, X.; Yuan, Y.; Wang, Y.; Pan, Y.; Yu, Z.; Li, Y.; Liu, T.; Jiang, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030650v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030650v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1296,"Clinical and Laboratory Profiles of 75 Hospitalized Patients with Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Hefei, China","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China. The number of cases has increased markedly in Anhui, but information on the clinical characteristics of patients is limited. We reported 75 patients with COVID-19 in the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory nasopharyngeal swab samples. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Of the 75 patients with COVID-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct or indirect exposure history to Wuhan. Common symptoms at onset included fever (66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). Of the patients without fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. The most prominent laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients with elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed significant decreases in the LYM%, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. Besides, the percentage of neutrophils, CRP, LDH and Procalcitonin levels increased significantly. We concluded that COVID-19 could cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. Hematological profiles including LYM, LDH, CRP and IL-6 could be indicators of diseases severity and evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Antiviral treatment requires a comprehensive and supportive approach. Further targeted therapy should be determined based on individual clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators.","Zhao, Z.; Xie, J.; Yin, M.; Yang, Y.; He, H.; Jin, T.; Li, W.; Zhu, X.; Xu, J.; Zhao, C.; Li, L.; Li, Y.; Mengist, H.

1297,Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak: an observational and modelling study,"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. Results: We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, R2=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020. Conclusion: The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.","Lai, S.; Ruktanonchai, N.

1298,"Exuberant elevation of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra during SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with disease severity and fatal outcome","The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, December 2019, and continuously poses a serious threat to public health. Our previous study has shown that cytokine storm occurred during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the detailed role of cytokines in the disease severity and progression remained unclear due to the limited case number. In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showed that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease deterioration and fatal outcome. In conclusion, we report three cytokines that closely associated with disease severity and outcome of COVID-19.

1299,Restoration of leukomonocyte counts is associated with viral clearance in COVID-19 hospitalized patients,"Background: Viral clearance is one important indicator for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS and SARS patients. The role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.Methods: From January 26 to February 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection. We propose that restoration of leukomonocytes counts can be added to the COVID-19 diagnostic guidanceas a criterion for releasing and discharging patients.","Chen, X.; Ling, J.; Mo, P.; Zhang, Y.; Jiang, Q.; Ma, Z.; Cao, Q.; Hu, W.; Zou, S.; Chen, L.; Yao, L.; Luo, M.; Chen, T.; Deng, L.; Liang, K.; Song, S.; Yang, R.; Zheng, R.; Gao, S.; Gui, X.; Ke, H.; Hou, W.; Lundkvist, A.; Xiong, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030437v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030437v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1300,Preliminary epidemiological analysis on children and adolescents with novel coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei Province in China: an observational study utilizing crowdsourced data,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients [&le;]19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%). Conclusions: The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19.

1301,Estimation of COVID-19 outbreak size in Italy based on international case exportations,"Italy is currently experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19 which emerged in the Lombardy region . During the interval between February 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of COVID-19 reported in 21 countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America which were either in individuals with recent travel from Italy, or who had presumed infection by a traveler from Italy 2. In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction. We used air travel volume between Italian cities and cities in other countries as an index of connectedness, using data available from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for February 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from Italy). We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days), and assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020. We also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel. When all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% CI 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases). We recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran. In summary, we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in South Korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of February 29, 2020.","Tuite, A.; Ng, V.; Rees, E.; Fisman, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030049v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030049v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1302,The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control,"The apparent early success in China's large-scale intervention to control the COVID-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when China relaxes the interventions. In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.","Di Lauro, F.; Kiss, I.

This study is aimed to investigate the risk perception and immediate psychological state of HCWs in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods This study utilized a cross-sectional survey designed on a convenient sample of 4357 HCWs in China. Its data were collected using anonymous structured questionnaires distributed through social software. 6 questions were set to evaluate the participants' risk perception of COVID-19, and a General Health Questionnaire was used to identify the participants' immediate psychological status. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Risk perception and psychological status were compared by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 exposure experiences. Result A total of 4,600 questionnaires were distributed, and 4,357 qualified ones (94.7%) were collected. The main concerns of HCWs are: infection of colleagues (72.5%), infection of family members (63.9%), protective measures (52.3%) and medical violence (48.5%). And 39.1% of the HCWs had psychological distress, especially working in Wuhan, participating in frontline treatments, having been isolated and having family members or colleagues infected. Conclusions The finding indicating that, faced with the COVID-19 epidemic, HCWs, especially in Wuhan, were worried about the risks of infection and protective measures, resulting in psychological distress, so further actions should be taken.","Dai, Y.; Hu, G.; Xiong, H.; Qiu, H.; Yuan, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030874v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030874v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True

Rapid diagnosis of patients remains a bottleneck in containing the progress of the epidemic. We used automated chemiluminescent immunoassay to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV of 736 subjects. COVID-19 patients were becoming reactive(positive) for specific antibodies from 7-12 days after the onset of morbidity. Specific IgM and IgG increased with the progression of the disease. The areas under the ROC curves of IgM and IgG were 0.988 and 1.000, respectively. Specific antibody detection has good sensitivity and specificity. Detection of specific antibodies in patients with fever can be a good distinction between COVID-19 and other diseases, so as to be a complement to nucleic acid diagnosis to early diagnosis of suspected cases.","Zhang, J.; Liu, J.; Li, N.; Liu, Y.; Ye, R.; Qin, X.; Zheng, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20030916v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20030916v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1305,"Clinical characteristics of 101 non-surviving hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A single center, retrospective study","Abstract Rationale: COVID-19 have deprived many lives in Wuhan, China and caused global concerns. Few studies focused on clinical characteristics non-survivors hospitalized with COVID-19. Objectives: We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of died patients with COVID-19 and tracked the causes of the rapid disease progression and death. Methods: 101 non-surviving patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical data were collected and compared between non-survivors who died within 3 days and after 3 days of admission. Multivariable regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors associated with rapid disease progression and death. Measurements and Main Results: Among included patients, median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-80), 60 (59.41%) were men. 82 (81.19%) had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (59 [58.42%]), diabetes (22 [21.78%]) etc. 100 (99.01%) suffered respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) developed acute cardiac injury, acute kidney and liver injury occurred in 23 (22.77%) and 18 (17.82%) patients, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that elevated high sensitivity troponin I (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.31-5.49, P=0.007), neutrophils (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, P=0.033) and depressed oxygen saturation (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.89-0.99, P=0.027) on admission were associated with rapid death of patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Older patients (>70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death with COVID-19. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney injury played a crucial role in the death of patients. Elevated high sensitivity troponin, neutrophils and depressed oxygen saturation predicted the rapid death of patients.","Shi, Q.; Zhao, K.; Yu, J.; Feng, J.; Zhao, K.; Zhang, X.; Chen, X.; Hu, P.; Hong, Y.; Li, M.; Liu, F.; Chen, C.; Wang, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031039v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031039v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1306,Human Kidney is a Target for Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection,"BACKGROUND The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) since December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has become an emergency of major international concern. Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen, immune cell markers (CD8, CD68 and CD56) and the complement C5b-9 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the viral particles in kidneys were also investigated by transmission electronic microscope (EM). RESULTS 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF). The eldery patients and cases with comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure more easily developed ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001, respectively). H&E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. EM observation also demonstrated that viruses- like particles are visible in the kidneys. Viral infection not only induces CD68+ macrophages infiltrated into tubulointerstitium, but also enhances complement C5b-9 deposition on tubules. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients. Viruses directly infect human kidney tubules to induce acute tubular damage. The viruses not only have direct cytotoxicity, but also initiate CD68+ macrophage together with complement C5b-9 deposition to mediate tubular pathogenesis.","Diao, B.; Feng, Z.; Wang, C.; Wang, H.; Liu, L.; Wang, C.; Wang, R.; Liu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Wang, G.; Yuan, Z.; Wu, Y.; Chen, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1307,Case fatality risk of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 in China,"Objective The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposed a substantial health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemic threat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.","Deng, X.; Yang, J.; Wang, W.; Wang, X.; Zhou, J.; Chen, Z.; Li, J.; Chen, Y.; Yan, H.; Zhang, J.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Qiu, Q.; Gong, H.; Wei, X.; Wang, L.; Sun, K.; Wu, P.; Ajelli, M.; Cowling, B.

1308,Validity of Wrist and Forehead Temperature in Temperature Screening in the General Population During the Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: a prospective real-world study,"Aims: Temperature screening is important in the population during the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature [&ge;]37.3C was 36.2C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity. Conclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients. The cut-off value of both measurements was 36.2C.","Chen, G.; Xie, J.; Dai, G.; Zheng, P.; Hu, X.; Lu, H.; Xu, L.; Chen, X.; Chen, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030148v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030148v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1309,Partial RdRp sequences offer a robust method for Coronavirus subgenus classification,"The recent reclassification of the Riboviria, and the introduction of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, ""MyCoV"", which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.

Importance StatementThe analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package  MyCoV which classifies user generated sequences.","Wilkinson, D.

1311,How to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from heart failure with computed tomography at initial medical contact during epidemic period,"OBJECTIVES To compare chest CT findings in heart failure with those of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography (CT) has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated. METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group. Importantly, there were also more patients with upper pulmonary vein enlargement (75% vs. 8.3%, p=0.001), subpleural effusion and cardiac enlargement in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group (50% vs. 0%, p=0.005, separately). Besides, more fibrous lesions were found in COVID-19 group although there was no statistical difference (25% vs. 0%, P=0.064) CONCLUSIONS Although there are some overlaps of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19, CT is still a useful tool in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zhu, Z.; Tang, J.; Chai, X.; Fang, Z.; Liu, Q.; Hu, X.; Xu, D.; He, J.; Tang, L.; Tai, S.; Wu, Y.; Zhou, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031047v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031047v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1312,Caution: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients at admission are changing,"Background With the emergence of 4rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered a new period. We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19. Methods Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. Results Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24).

In this retrospective study, we attempt to summarize and analyze the chest CT features of 2019-nCov infections, and to identify the typical features to improved the diagnostic accuracy of new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Methods:Chest CT scans and Clinical data of 21 patients confirmed NCP in our hospital were enrolled.These patients were divided into mild and sever group according to clinical manifestations described by the 6th clinical practice guideline of NCP in China. Main clinical and chest CT features were analyzed and identify. Results: Fever (85.7%) and cough (80.9%) were the two main symptoms of NCP patients.More significantly higher incidence (85.7%) of shortness of breath in the severe cases. Multiple lesions in both lungs and with incidence of GGO(100%),vascular enlargement (76.5%) and cobblestone/reticular pattern(70.6%) were the major feature.The incidence of consolidation, mixed pattern and vascular enlargement features were up to 100% in the severe group, significantly higher than that of patients in mild group. In addition, the incidence of air-bronchogram, dilated bronchi with thickened wall and fibrosis in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild group. Conclusions: Fever and cough are the typical clinical features of NCP patients, and chest CT mainly manifested as multiple lesions in both lungs, often accompanied by GGO, vascular enlargement and cobblestone/reticular pattern.Changes in these main CT features can indicate development of the disease.","Wu, w.; xu, z.; Jin, y.; Pan, a.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030775v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030775v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1314,Prediction of New Coronavirus Infection Based on a Modified SEIR Model,"BACKGROUND The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, poses a huge threat to China and even global public health security. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.","Tang, Z.; Li, X.; Li, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030858v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030858v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True

1316,"Adjusted age-specific case fatality ratio during the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China, January and February 2020","Background. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now pandemic. Reliable estimates of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential to guide control efforts and to plan health care system requirements. The objectives of this study are to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) give estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for bias in the two regions with the world's highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 deaths: Hubei province, China and northern Italy. Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases; preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality (right-censoring). We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0% (95% credible interval: 2.6-3.4%) in Hubei province and 3.3% (2.0-4.7%) in northern Italy. Mortality increased with age; we estimate that among 80+ year olds, 39.0% (95%CrI: 31.1-48.9%) in Hubei province and 89.0% (95%CrI: 56.2-99.6%) in northern Italy dies or will die. Limitations are that the model requires data recorded by date of onset and that sex-disaggregated mortality was not available. Conclusions. We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the crude CFR for bias due to right-censoring and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group. While specific to the situation in Hubei, China and northern Italy during these periods, these findings will help the mitigation efforts and planning of resources as other regions prepare for SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.","Riou, J.; Hauser, A.; Counotte, M.

1317,Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the post-pandemic period,"There is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in coming years. These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","Kissler, S.

1318,How does the outbreak of 2019-nCoV spread in mainland China? A retrospective analysis of the dynamic transmission routes,"The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the 2019-nCoV, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 - February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-province routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV.","Jiang, X.; Chang, L.; Shi, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029645v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029645v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1319,"Clinical features and outcomes of 221 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Rationale: In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China, now spreading across the whole country and world. More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.

1320,Risk estimation and prediction by modeling the transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in mainland China excluding Hubei province,"Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of oversea countries. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. Conclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province.","Wan, H.; Cui, J.-a.; Yang, G.-J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029629v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029629v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1321,ddPCR: a more sensitive and accurate tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection in low viral load specimens,"Background: Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. Methods: We explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. Among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. The experiment was double-blind. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimized ddPCR is at least 500 times lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of ddPCR for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were correctly judged by ddPCR based on the follow-up investigation. In addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by RT-PCR were positive by ddPCR detection. Conclusions: ddPCR shows superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. Before the ddPCR to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.","Suo, T.; Liu, X.; Guo, M.; Feng, J.; Hu, W.; Yang, Y.; Zhang, Q.; Wang, X.; Sajid, M.; Guo, D.; Huang, Z.; Deng, L.; Chen, T.; Liu, F.; Xu, K.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, Q.; Liu, Y.; Xiong, Y.; Guo, G.; Chen, Y.; Lan, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029439v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029439v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1322,The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China,"The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","Kraemer, M. U.

1323,Evaluation of the incidence of COVID-19 and of the efficacy of contention measures in Spain: a data-driven approach.,"Our society is currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China - were the outbreak started - seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second-order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases","Aleta, A.; Moreno, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029801v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029801v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True
1324,Transmission interval estimates suggest pre-symptomatic spread of COVID-19,"Background: As the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading, incoming data allows us to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic. We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission. Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65,2.09) secondary cases per infective. Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.","Tindale, L.; Coombe, M.; Stockdale, J.

We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir. The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.","Easom, N.; Moss, P.; Barlow, G.; Samson, A.; Taynton, T.; Adams, K.; Ivan, M.; Burns, P.; Gajee, K.; Eastick, K.; Lillie, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029462v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029462v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True

This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. Methods: Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Results: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 &ldquo:generations"" was observed. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years (including 3 children) and 49 (47.12%) were male. Most patients had typical symptoms, 5 asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days. Just 9 of 16 severe patients required ICU care. Until Feb 12, 2020, 40 (38.46%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died. For the antiviral treatment, 80 (76.92%) patients received traditional Chinese medicine therapy. Conclusions: Family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers. Asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may bring more risk to the spread of COVID-19.

1327,Nanopore target sequencing for accurate and comprehensive detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses,"The ongoing novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, has engendered numerous cases of infection and death. COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; however, current recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates, low sensitivity, and cannot identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting patient misdiagnosis and impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of target amplification and long-read, real-time nanopore sequencing, we developed nanopore target sequencing (NTS) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6-10 h. Parallel testing with approved qPCR kits of SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19 cases confirmed that NTS identified more infected patients as positive, and could also monitor for mutated nucleic acid sequence or other respiratory virus infection in the test sample. NTS is thus suitable for contemporary COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, this platform can be further extended for diagnosing other viruses or pathogens.","Wang, M.; Fu, A.; Hu, B.; Tong, Y.; Liu, R.; Gu, J.; Liu, J.; Jiang, W.; Shen, G.; Zhao, W.; Men, D.; Yu, L.; Deng, Z.; Li, Y.; Liu, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20029538v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20029538v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True

1329,The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which originated in Wuhan, China, constitutes a public health emergency of international concern with a very high risk of spread and impact at the global level. We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.","Zhang, Y.; Jiang, B.; Yuan, J.; Tao, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031187v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031187v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True

METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age <20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18. We found that at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in Wuhan, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have effectively controlled the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Special efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers, elderly and children. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions.","Wang, C.; Liu, L.; Hao, X.; Guo, H.; Wang, Q.; Huang, J.; He, N.; Yu, H.; Lin, X.; Pan, A.; Wei, S.; Wu, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593v1?rss=1,2020-03-06,2020-03-06,,True

We aim to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patient with COVID-19 in Hunan which is adjacent to Hubei. Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients' electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020. Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients. Typical lung imaging finding were bilateral and unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia occurred in 36.1%, 22.7% and 50.2% patients respectively.

Compared with mild or moderate group, severe/critical group had a relative higher level of neutrophil, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, h-CRP, ESR, CK, CK-MB, LDH, D-dimer, and a lower level of lymphocyte, eosinophils, platelet, HDL and sodium (all p<0.01). Most patients received antiviral therapy and Chinese Medicine therapy. As of February 20, 2020, 159 (54.6%) patients were discharged and 2 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization. The median length of hospital stay in discharged patients was 12 days (IQR: 10-15). Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hunan is different from patients in Wuhan. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group and moderate group were higher than mild group.

1334,"Clinical Features of Patients Infected with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Shanghai, China","Background: Since mid-December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia-like diseases caused by a novel coronavirus, now designated COVID-19 by the WHO, emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. Conclusions: In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts. Older age, male, fever over 38.5oC, symptoms of dyspnoea, and underlying comorbidity, were the risk factors most associated with severity of disease.

1335,Significance of hydrophobic and charged sequence similarities in sodium-bile acid cotransporter and vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor,"Sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also denominated sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is an integral membrane protein with multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.","Zunaid, I.

To fight against COVID-19, we carried out research for the near native SARS-CoV-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM). We observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. Spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. The morphology of virion observed in our result indicates that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is in post-fusion state, with S1 disassociated.

1338,A novel bat coronavirus reveals natural insertions at the S1/S2 cleavage site of the Spike protein and a possible recombinant origin of HCoV-19,"The unprecedented epidemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, HCoV-19, in China and beyond has caused public health concern at a global scale. Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-191,2, the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature. Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated from multiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats and other wildlife species.","Zhou, H.; Chen, X.; Hu, T.; Li, J.; Song, H.; Liu, Y.; Wang, P.; Liu, D.; Yang, J.; Holmes, E.

1340,Strong evolutionary convergence of receptor-binding protein spike between COVID-19 and SARS-related coronaviruses,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.","Wu, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.975995v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.975995v1?rss=1,2020-03-04,2020-03-04,,False
1341,"Epidemiology and Transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen China: Analysis of 391 cases and 1,286 of their close contacts","Background Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 21 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.","Bi, Q.; Wu, Y.; Mei, S.; Ye, C.; Zou, X.; Zhang, Z.; Liu, X.; Wei, L.; Truelove, S.

1342,A simple model to assess Wuhan lock-down effect and region efforts during COVID-19 epidemic in China Mainland,"Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model.

Closed environments are consistent with large-scale COVID-19 transmission events such as that of the ski chalet-associated cluster in France and the church- and hospital-associated clusters in South Korea. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease. Reduction of unnecessary close contact in closed environments may help prevent large case clusters and superspreading events.","Nishiura, H.; Oshitani, H.; Kobayashi, T.; Saito, T.; Sunagawa, T.; Matsui, T.; Wakita, T.; MHLW COVID-19 Response Team,; Suzuki, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True
1344,Analysis of epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus 2019 infection and preventive measures in Shenzhen China: a heavy population city,"Coronavirus 2019 infection (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, Hubei and spread to all provinces in China and other countries. Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by February 20, 2020. Here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of patients from Hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. The newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases reached its peak around January 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at Shenzhen. A series of early preventive strategies were implemented since January 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in Shenzhen. All the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of COVID-19. Observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. Protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at Shenzhen from Hubei was implemented in February 2. After the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the COVID-19 cases started to decline since February 6. There were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in Shenzhen. In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into Shenzhen city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen. Early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in Shenzhen.","Yang, K.; Wang, L.; Li, F.; Chen, D.; Li, X.; Qiu, C.; Chen, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20028555v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20028555v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True
1345,Relations of parameters for describing the epidemic of COVID-19 by the Kermack-McKendrick model,"In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID[-]19, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model.

The second relation p({infty}) {approx}1-exp(-(R0-1)/0.60) is the relation between p({infty}), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society,and the basic reproduction number, R0, which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time. The third relation 1/{tau}end=1/{tau}inf-(1-p({infty}))/{tau}trans gives the decay time constant{tau} end at the ending stage of the epidemic.

Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020. Results267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]).

Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%). 53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF- and INF-{gamma}, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF- was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%.

We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country's vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19. Countries' vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries' management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February 15, 2020.","Lin, Y.-C.; Chi, W.-J.; Lin, Y.-T.; Lai, C.-Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029413v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029413v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True
1348,"Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control","Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039]. Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially nFLNs, and GP under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat VT in medical staff and GP are extremely necessary.","Li, Z.; Ge, J.; Yang, M.; Feng, J.; Qiao, M.; Jiang, R.; Bi, J.; Zhan, G.; Xu, X.; Wang, L.; Zhou, Q.; Zhou, C.; Pan, Y.; Liu, S.; Zhang, H.; Yang, J.; Zhu, B.; Hu, Y.; Hashimoto, K.; Jia, Y.; Wang, H.; Wang, R.; Liu, C.; Yang, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029322v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029322v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True
1349,Crystal structure of Nsp15 endoribonuclease NendoU from SARS-CoV-2,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is rapidly spreading around the world. There is no existing vaccine or proven drug to prevent infections and stop virus proliferation. Although this virus is similar to human and animal SARS- and MERS-CoVs the detailed information about SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures and functions is urgently needed to rapidly develop effective vaccines, antibodies and antivirals. We applied high-throughput protein production and structure determination pipeline at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases to produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins and structures. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease Nsp15/NendoU from SARS-CoV-2 - a virus causing current world-wide epidemics.

1350,Multi-epitope vaccine design using an immunoinformatics approach for 2019 novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2),"A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, recently discovered in Wuhan, China, has caused over 74000 infection cases and 2000 deaths. Due to the rapidly growing cases and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we performed an in silico approach based on the available virus genome to identify the antigenic B-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. A total of 61 B-cell epitopes were initially identified, 19 of which with higher potential immunogenicity were used for vaccine design. 499 T-cell epitopes were predicted that showed affinity with the 34 most popular HLA alleles in Chinese population. Based on these epitopes, 30 vaccine candidates were designed and inspected against safety risks, including potential toxicity, human homologous, pharmaceutical peptides and bioactive peptides. Majority of vaccine peptides contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, which may interact with the most prevalent HLA alleles accounting for ~99% of Chinese population. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. In conclusion, these putative antigenic peptides may elicit the resistance response to the viral infection. In vitro and in vivo experiments are required to validate the effectiveness of these peptide vaccine.","Feng, Y.; Qiu, M.; Zou, S.; Li, Y.; Luo, K.; Chen, R.; Sun, Y.; Wang, K.; Zhuang, X.; Zhang, S.; Chen, S.; Mo, F.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,False
1351,Evidence for RNA editing in the transcriptome of 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"The 2019-nCoV outbreak has become a global health risk. Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from two Wuhan patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals patterns similar to the RNA editing pattern observed in the 2019-nCoV transcriptomes. Our results suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.","Di Giorgio, S.; Martignano, F.; Torcia, M.

1352,Isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from the first US COVID-19 patient,"The etiologic agent of the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan China was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in January, 2020. The first US patient was diagnosed by the State of Washington and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 20, 2020. We isolated virus from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens, and characterized the viral sequence, replication properties, and cell culture tropism. We found that the virus replicates to high titer in Vero-CCL81 cells and Vero E6 cells in the absence of trypsin. We also deposited the virus into two virus repositories, making it broadly available to the public health and research communities. We hope that open access to this important reagent will expedite development of medical countermeasures.

1354,Association of Cardiovascular Manifestations with In-hospital Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19: A Hospital Staff Data,"Background: The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events. Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.","Liu, R.; Ming, X.; Zhu, H.; Song, L.; Gao, Z.; Gao, L.; Jia, S.; Zhang, C.; Xu, O.; Zhou, J.; Yuan, J.; Zhang, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029348v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True
1355,The Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Medical Treatment of Chinese Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)：A Multicenter Cross-section Study in the Context of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,"Objective: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the medical advice seeking of Chinese children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Materials and Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc. This is a Multicenter Cross-section Study. Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD. Online consultation, medication delivery and psychological counselling are the greatest needs reported by patients and their families and could especially provide solutions for the management of low income children with CKD in remote rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Zhang, G.; Yang, H.; Zhang, A.; Shen, Q.; Wang, L.; Li, Z.; Li, Y.; Zhao, L.; Du, Y.; Sun, L.; Zhao, B.; Zhu, H.; Fu, H.; Li, X.; Gao, X.; Hao, S.; Ding, J.; Chen, Z.; Xu, Z.; Liu, X.; Wu, D.; Gao, M.; Wang, M.; Li, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029199v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029199v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True

This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.","Song, P.

1357,Precautions are Needed for COVID-19 Patients with Coinfection of Common Respiratory Pathogens,"Background: With the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), infected patients within and beyond the epidemic area, Wuhan, China, showed different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens.

1358,Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019,"Summary Background The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). Interpretation The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, J.; Yuan, Q.; Wang, H.; Liu, W.; Liao, X.; Su, Y.; Wang, X.; Yuan, J.; Li, T.; Li, J.; Qian, S.; Hong, C.; Wang, F.; Liu, Y.; Wang, Z.; He, Q.; Li, Z.; He, B.; Zhang, T.; Ge, S.; Liu, L.; Zhang, J.; Xia, N.; Zhang, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030189v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030189v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True
1359,Detectable serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is closely associated with drastically elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) level in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Background: Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.","Chen, X.; Zhao, B.; Qu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Xiong, J.; Feng, Y.; Men, D.; Huang, Q.; Liu, Y.; Yang, B.; Ding, J.; Li, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029520v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029520v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True

The positive rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid was 42.10%. The positive detection rate of combination of IgM and IgG for patients with COVID-19 negative and positive nucleic acid test was 72.73% and 87.50%. The results were significantly higher than the nucleic acid or IgM, IgG single detection. hsCRP in the COVID-19 nucleic acid negative group showed significantly higher than the positive groups (P=0.0298). AST in the COVID-19 IgM negative group showed significantly lower than the positive groups (P=0.0365).

As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay ([&le;]10 days) and long-term hospital stay (>10 days). Results The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset. Conclusions The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Qi, X.; Jiang, Z.; YU, Q.; Shao, C.; Zhang, H.; Yue, H.; Ma, B.; Wang, Y.; Liu, C.; Meng, X.; Huang, S.; Wang, J.; Xu, D.; Lei, J.; Xie, G.; Huang, H.; Yang, J.; Ji, J.; Pan, H.; Zou, S.; Ju, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029603v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029603v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True
1362,The level of plasma C-reactive protein is closely related to the liver injury in patients with COVID-19,"Aims: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the most severe public health issue all over the world. Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP [&ge;]20 mg/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1*10^9/L were independently related to hepatic injury. Conclusions: Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury.

1363,"Epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia in Beijing, China","Background:SARS-CoV-2-caused coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is posinga large casualty. The features of COVID-19patients withand without pneumonia,SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results:We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (<190/L) of CD8+ T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 andlactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively. During disease course,T lymphocytes were generally lower,neutrophils higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocytes did not increase at the 20th days after illness onset. Conclusion: The epidemiological features areimportant for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Circulating interleukin-6 and lactateare independent prognostic factors.

1364,Systematic Review of the Registered Clinical Trials of Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19),"Background: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many researchers in China have immediately carried out clinical research scheme of the COVID-19. But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 to summarize the characteristics of the COVID-19 registered clinical trials. Methods: This study is based on the recommendations of the PRISMA in the Cochrane handbook. The databases from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Results: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) of COVID-19 were obtained. A majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials had been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in a pre-experiment stage, 15 trials belonged to phrase and 4 trials were phrase . The methods of intervention included traditional Chinese medicine involving 26 trials, Western medicine involving 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine involving 19 trials. The subjects were mainly non-critical adult patients ([&ge;] 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60 - 200), and the median execute time of the trials was 179 d (IQR: 94 - 366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, both the methodology quality of interventional trials and observational studies were low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will being carried out in China. However, based on the low methodology quality and small sample size and long studies execute time, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment in the near future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China.","Zhu, R.-f.; Gao, R.-l.; Robert, S.-H.; Gao, J.-p.; Yang, S.-g.; Zhu, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029611v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029611v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True

Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and outcome is urgently needed. Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients. Next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in COVID-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. Results: Our results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. LYM% in patients with moderate COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Therefore, we established a reliable Time from symptom onset-LYM% model (TLM), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

1366,"Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Severe Pneumonia Caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China","Abstract Background: A new virus broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and was later named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The clinical characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV are still not clear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China. Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia. Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-severe pneumonia. Statistical analysis showed that advanced age, an increase of D-dimer, and a decrease of lymphocytes were characteristics of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of patients with the severe pneumonia showed the illness can progress rapidly. Conclusions: Advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-dimer elevation are important characteristics of patients with severe pneumonia. Clinicians should focus on these characteristics to identify high-risk patients at an early stage.","Wang, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Yang, Z.; Xia, D.; Geng, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20029306v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.20029306v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True

We assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses. METHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus, with disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16% to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3% to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in early epidemic phase. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak.","Jackson, M.

1369,Highly ACE2 Expression in Pancreas May Cause Pancreas Damage After SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the end of 2019 in China has triggered a global public health crisis. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS-CoV. The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. Our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that pancreatitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection should also be paid attention in clinical work.","Liu, F.; Long, X.; Zou, W.; Fang, M.; Wu, W.; Li, W.; Zhang, B.; Zhang, W.; Chen, X.; Zhang, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029181v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029181v1?rss=1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,,True
1370,The 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) surface protein (Spike) S1 Receptor Binding Domain undergoes conformational change upon heparin binding.,"Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.","Mycroft-West, C.

However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","Ji, X.; Zhang, C.; Zhai, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Zhang, C.; Xue, Y.; Tan, G.; Niu, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.967588v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.967588v1?rss=1,2020-03-02,2020-03-02,,False

Till date, no vaccine or completely effective drug is available to cure COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is crucially needed. This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins were taken as targets and different epitopes (B-cell, T-cell and IFN-{gamma} inducing) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the worlds population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the MEV. The antigenicity, allergenicity, physiochemical properties and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible. Molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning of MEV ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. Designed MEV in present study could be a potential candidate for further vaccine production process against COVID-19. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed MEV needs to be experimentally validated.","Tahir ul Qamar, M.; Rehman, A.; Ashfaq, U. A.; Awan, M.

However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear.

MethodsWe collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses.

ResultsSystematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed co-circulation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site.

ConclusionsOur studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion.

To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, only limited therapeutic options are available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, for their activity against the isolate. The primary assay confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis and identified 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-of-addition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that 8 and 4 therapeutics act on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the drugs were e.g., three cardiotonic agents (ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin) with a TI greater than 100, an anti-malaria drug (atovaquone; TI >34), an inhalable corticosteroid (ciclesonide; TI >6), etc. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treating MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for agents against a wider range of coronavirus-related illnesses, including the currently emerging Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.","Ko, M.; Chang, S.

To detect SARS-CoV-2 early and control the disease spreading on time, a faster and more convenient method for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detecting, RT-LAMP method (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) was developed. RNA reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification were performed in one step at 63  isothermal conditions, and the results can be obtained within 30 minutes. ORF1ab gene, E gene and N gene were detected at the same time. ORF1ab gene was very specific and N gene was very sensitivity, so they can guarantee both sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2.

1377,Strategies for vaccine design for corona virus using Immunoinformatics techniques,"The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.","Basu, A.; Sarkar, A.; Maulik, U.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422v1?rss=1,2020-03-02,2020-03-02,,False
1378,Comparative genomic analysis revealed specific mutation pattern between human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is a member of the family coronaviridae and contains a single-stranded RNA genome with positive-polarity. To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.","Lv, L.; Li, G.; Chen, J.; Liang, X.; Li, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.969006v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.969006v1?rss=1,2020-03-02,2020-03-02,,False

Here we provide assay designs and experimental resources, for use with CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection, that could be valuable for ongoing surveillance. We provide assay designs for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. The designs are outputs of algorithms that we are developing for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays that are comprehensive across genomic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific. Of our design set, we experimentally screened 4 SARS-CoV-2 designs with a CRISPR-Cas13 detection system and then extensively tested the highest-performing SARS-CoV-2 assay. We demonstrate the sensitivity and speed of this assay using synthetic targets with fluorescent and lateral flow detection.

1380,Kallikrein 13: a new player in coronaviral infections.,"Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells. We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential.","Milewska, A.; Falkowski, K.; Kalinska, M.; Bielecka, E.; Naskalska, A.; Mak, P.; Lesner, A.; Ochman, M.; Urlik, M.; Potempa, J.; Kantyka, T.; Pyrc, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.971499v1?rss=1,2020-03-02,2020-03-02,,False

The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes.

1383,"Estimation of local novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan, China from off-site reported cases and population flow data from different sources","Backgrounds: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas. The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu.

In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo drug design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed classical and mix-solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro) enriched by evolutionary and stability analysis of the protein. The results were compared with those for a highly similar SARS Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the binding sites conformational changes during the simulation time indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicates that the virus mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.","Bzowka, M.; Mitusinska, K.; Raczynska, A.; Samol, A.; Tuszynski, J.

1385,Analysis on the Clinical Characteristics of 36 Cases of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Kunming,"Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming City, and to study the correlation between nutritional status and immune function. Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third People's Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3+T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4+T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8+T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4+/ CD8+ inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia.

At the current stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this paper suggests a simple and operable formula to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritised and potentially reducing the mortality rate.","Yan, L.; Zhang, H.-T.; Xiao, Y.; Wang, M.; Sun, C.; Liang, J.; Li, S.; Zhang, M.; Guo, Y.; Xiao, Y.; Tang, X.; Cao, H.; Tan, X.; Huang, N.; Jiao, B.; Luo, A.; Cao, Z.; Xu, H.; Yuan, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028027v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028027v1?rss=1,2020-03-01,2020-03-01,,True

Methods: We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women. Results: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]).

1390,Heart injury signs are associated with higher and earlier mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Importance: Heart injury can be easily induced by viral infection such as adenovirus and enterovirus. However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020. Exposures: High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; -HBDH). Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). Results: Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission ([&ge;] 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and -HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and -HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and -HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.","Wu, C.; Hu, X.; Song, J.; Du, C.; Xu, J.; Yang, D.; Chen, D.; Zhong, M.; Jiang, J.; Xiong, W.; Lang, K.; Zhang, Y.; Shi, G.; Xu, L.; Song, Y.; Zhou, X.; Wei, M.; Zheng, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028589v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028589v1?rss=1,2020-02-29,2020-02-29,,True
1391,A simple ecological model captures the transmission pattern of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in China,"The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), initially reported in the city of Wuhan in China, and quickly transmitted to the entire nation and beyond, has become an international public health emergency. Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March.

We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.","Liu, X.; Li, Z.; Liu, S.; Chen, Z.; Zhao, Z.; Huang, Y.-y.; Zhang, Q.; Wang, J.; Shi, Y.; Xu, Y.; Sun, J.; Xian, H.; Fang, R.; Bai, F.; Ou, C.; Xiong, B.; Lew, A.

1393,Infection Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19)Modeled with the Integration of the Eyring Rate ProcessTheory and Free Volume Concept,"The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions. The susceptible individ- uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R0. Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.","Hao, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028571v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028571v1?rss=1,2020-02-29,2020-02-29,,True
1394,"Clinical characteristics of 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Background Although the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19. Methods For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. Results We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days. Interpretation Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.","Huang, Y.; Zhou, H.; Yang, R.; Xu, Y.; Feng, X.; Gong, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20029009v1?rss=1,2020-02-29,2020-02-29,,True
1395,Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation,"Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.","Tang, S.; Tang, B.; Bragazzi, N.

1396,Modeling the Epidemic Dynamics and Control of COVID-19 Outbreak in China,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading over China and more than 30 countries in last two months. COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R>1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R<1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020. After fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of COVID-19 of Wuhan and Hubei are around late-March, of China (excluding Hubei) around mid-March, and of the four tier-one cities before March 2020. A total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). We suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late-March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan and Iran.","Zhao, S.; Chen, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028639v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028639v1?rss=1,2020-02-29,2020-02-29,,True

1398,Evaluation of the clinical characteristics of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 during home care with isolation: A new retrospective analysis based on O2O,"Summary Background The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 (COVID-19) has activated top-level response nationwide. We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older([&ge;]8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.","Xu, H.; Huang, S.; Liu, S.; Deng, J.; Jiao, B.; Ai, L.; Xiao, Y.; Yan, L.; Li, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028084v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028084v1?rss=1,2020-02-29,2020-02-29,,True
1399,"The Effects of ""Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan"" Makeshift Hospitals and Temperature on the Mortality of COVID-19","Background In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, however, the factors affecting the mortality remain unclear. Methods Thirty-two days of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather Net were collected using standard forms. The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases before and after the use of Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan makeshift hospitals (MSHs) was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearman analysis. Results The mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P < 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with temperature both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012).

1400,Estimate the incubation period of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19),"Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. Our results further indicated that the incubation difference between males and females did not demonstrate a statistical significance.","Han, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027474v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027474v1?rss=1,2020-02-29,2020-02-29,,True

SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P>0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.","chen, d.; Li, X.; song, q.; Hu, C.; Su, F.; Dai, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.27.20028530v1?rss=1,2020-02-29,2020-02-29,,True

While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p<0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p<0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.","Ying, S.; Li, F.; Geng, X.; Li, Z.; Du, X.; Chen, H.; Chen, S.; Zhang, M.; Shao, Z.; Wu, Y.; Syeda, M.

1408,"Community responses during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong: risk perception, information exposure and preventive measures","Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07). Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.","Kwok, K. O.; Li, K.

1409,Clinical Features of COVID-19 Related Liver Damage,"BACKGROUND: A recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs mainly in China, with rapidly increasing the number of cases (namely COVID-19). Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission, characterized by an increased of alt, ast, GGT, AKP. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.","Fan, Z.; Chen, L.; Li, J.; Tian, C.; Zhang, Y.; Huang, S.; Liu, Z.; Cheng, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20026971v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20026971v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,True
1410,Spike protein binding prediction with neutralizing antibodies of SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV), originated in Wuhan seafood and animal market, China. Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the {beta}-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Park, T.; Lee, S.-Y.; Kim, S.; Kim, M. J.; Kim, H.

1412,"Prevalence and clinical features of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Fever Clinic of a teaching hospital in Beijing: a single-center, retrospective study","Background With the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province to other areas of the country, medical staff in Fever Clinics faced the challenge of identifying suspected cases among patients with respiratory infections manifested with fever. We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing. Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups. Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P<0.001). The COVID-19 group had lower WBC [5.19x10^9/L ({+/-}1.47) versus 7.21x10^9/L ({+/-}2.94), P<0.001] and neutrophil counts [3.39x10^9/L ({+/-}1.48) versus 5.38x10^9/L ({+/-}2.85), P<0.001] in peripheral blood. However, the percentage and count of lymphocytes were not different. On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008). Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting to our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%. Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies.","Liang, Y.; Liang, J.; Zhou, Q.; Li, X.; Lin, F.; Deng, Z.; Zhang, B.; Li, L.; Wang, X.; Zhu, H.; Ma, Q.; Xu, J.; Sun, Y.; Tong, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027763v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027763v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,True
1413,Clinical and radiographic features of cardiac injury in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,"Objective: To investigate the correlation between clinical characteristics and cardiac injury of COVID-2019 pneumonia. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019. ResultsOf the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion: Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.","Hui, H.; Zhang, Y.; Yang, X.; Wang, X.; He, B.; Li, L.; Li, H.; Tian, J.; Chen, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027052v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027052v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,True

1415,Clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19,"Background A recently developing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 was originated in Wuhan, China, and has quickly spread across the world. We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital's electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.","Zhang, B.; Zhou, X.; Qiu, Y.; Feng, F.; Feng, J.; Jia, Y.; Zhu, H.; Hu, K.; Liu, J.; Liu, Z.; Wang, S.; Gong, Y.; Zhou, C.; Zhu, T.; Cheng, Y.; Liu, Z.; Deng, H.; Tao, F.; Ren, Y.; Cheng, B.; Gao, L.; Wu, X.; Yu, L.; Huang, Z.; Mao, Z.; Song, Q.; Zhu, B.; Wang, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028191v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,True

Within two months of the outbreak, more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide. Since the human to human transmission occurred easily and the human infection is rapidly increasing, the sensitive and early diagnosis is essential to prevent the global outbreak. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) announced various primer and probe sets for SARS-CoV-2 previously developed in China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, and USA. In this study, we compared the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA among the seven primer-probe sets for N gene and the three primer-probe sets for Orf1 gene. The result of the comparative analysis represented that the  2019-nCoV_N2, N3 of USA and the  ORF1ab of China are the most sensitive primer-probe sets for N and Orf1 genes, respectively.

The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.","Li, L.; Sun, T.; He, Y.; Li, W.; Fan, Y.; Zhang, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.965434v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.965434v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,False
1418,A simple magnetic nanoparticles-based viral RNA extraction method for efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2,"1The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originating from Wuhan, China, draws worldwide concerns due to its long incubation period and strong infectivity. Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. Benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turn-around time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.","Zhao, Z.; Cui, H.; Song, W.; Ru, X.; Zhou, W.; Yu, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.961268v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.961268v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,False

Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.","Wang, P.-H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.963348v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.963348v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,False
1420,"Structure-based drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening rapidly identify antiviral leads targeting COVID-19","A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan1-4. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 M. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.","Jin, Z.; Du, X.; Xu, Y.; Deng, Y.; Liu, M.; Zhao, Y.; Zhang, B.; Li, X.; Zhang, L.; Duan, Y.; Yu, J.; Wang, L.; Yang, K.; Liu, F.; You, T.; Liu, X.; Yang, X.; Bai, F.; Liu, H.; Liu, X.; Guddat, L.

1421,"Clinical features and sexual transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infected female patients: a descriptive study in Wuhan, China","Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42.9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.","Cui, P.; Chen, Z.; Wang, T.; Dai, J.; Zhang, J.; Ding, T.; Jiang, J.; Liu, J.; Zhang, C.; Shan, W.; Wang, S.; Rong, Y.; Chang, J.; Miao, X.; Ma, X.; Wang, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028225v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028225v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,True
1422,Perceptions of the Adult US Population regarding the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak,"Background: COVID-19 outbreak is spreading globally. Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak. Conclusion: Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.","McFadden, S. M.; Malik, A. A.; Aguolu, O.

1423,Correlation Analysis Between Disease Severity and Inflammation-related Parameters in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Aim: The new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreaking at the end of 2019 is highly contagious. Crude mortality rate reached 49% in critical patients. Inflammation matters on disease progression. This study analyzed blood inflammation indicators among mild, severe and critical patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients were included and divided to mild, severe or critical groups. Correlation of peripheral blood inflammation-related indicators with disease criticality was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve. ResultsSignificantly, disease severity were associated with age (R=-0.564, P<0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) (R=-0.534, P<0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R=-0.535, P<0.001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (R=-0.308, P<0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (R=-0.422, P<0.001), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) (R=-0.322, P<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (R=-0.604, P<0.001), ferroprotein (R=-0.508, P<0.001), procalcitonin (R=-0.650, P<0.001), white cell counts (WBC) (R=-0.54, P<0.001), lymphocyte counts (LC) (R=-0.56, P<0.001), neutrophil count (NC) (R=-0.585, P<0.001) and eosinophil counts (EC) (R=-0.299, P=0.01). ConclusionWith following parameters such as age >67.5 years, IL2R >793.5U/mL, CRP >30.7ng/mL, ferroprotein >2252g/L, WBC>9.5*10^9/L or NC >7.305*10^9/L, the progress of COVID-19 to critical stage should be closely observed and possibly prevented. Inflammation is closely related to severity of COVID-19, and IL-6, TNF and IL-8 might be promising therapeutic targets.","Gong, J.; Dong, H.; Xia, S. Q.; Huang, Y.

1424,Application and optimization of RT-PCR in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global threat to public health. Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, G.; Renc, X.; Liu, Y.; Chen, H.; Liu, W.; Guo, Z.; Zhang, Y.; Chen, C.; Zhou, J.; Xiao, Q.; Shan, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027755v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027755v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,True

1426,"Transmission potential of the New Corona (COVID-19) onboard the Princess Cruises Ship, 2020","An outbreak of COVID-19 developed aboard the Princess Cruises Ship during January-February 2020. Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1-7). Our findings suggest that Rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control.

1427,"Comorbidity and its impact on 1,590 patients with COVID-19 in China: A Nationwide Analysis","Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of comorbidities and its impact on the clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design: Retrospective case studies Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18 (1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P<0.05). After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD (HR 2.681, 95%CI 1.424-5.048), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus rapidly spreads all over the world and takes thousands of lives in just two months. It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients in the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our result shows a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.","HE, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027672v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027672v1?rss=1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,,True
1429,An Effective CTL Peptide Vaccine for Ebola Zaire Based on Survivors' CD8+ Targeting of a Particular Nucleocapsid Protein Epitope with Potential Implications for COVID-19 Vaccine Design,The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage.

1430,Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.","Hilton, J.; Keeling, M.

Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2.

1433,Case fatality rate of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in China,"Abstract Background: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which have caused more than 80 thousand persons infected globally is still ongoing. This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR). Methods: The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks. Conclusion: The method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.","Qi, R.; Ye, C.; Qin, X.-r.; Yu, X.-J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028076v1?rss=1,2020-02-26,2020-02-26,,True

The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19. This study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in COVID-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in COVID-19.","Liao, M.; Liu, Y.; Yuan, J.; Wen, Y.; Xu, G.; Zhao, J.; Chen, L.; Li, J.; Wang, X.; Wang, F.; Liu, L.; Zhang, S.; Zhang, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690v1?rss=1,2020-02-26,2020-02-26,,True

Our research aimed to construct a system based on deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT, relieve working pressure of radiologists and contribute to the control of the epidemic. Methods: For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model. Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. For 27 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist.

1437,Genomic variations of COVID-19 suggest multiple outbreak sources of transmission,"We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into two major genotypes, Type I and Type II. Type I can be further divided into Type IA and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control.","Zhang, L.; Yang, J.-R.; Zhang, Z.; Lin, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027953v1?rss=1,2020-02-26,2020-02-26,,True

1439,"TWIRLS, an automated topic-wise inference method based on massive literature, suggests a possible mechanism via ACE2 for the pathological changes in the human host after coronavirus infection","Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the ""coronavirus"" should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","Ji, X.; Zhang, C.; Zhai, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Xue, Y.; Zhang, C.; Tan, G.; Niu, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025437v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025437v1?rss=1,2020-02-26,2020-02-26,,True
1440,A Novel Method for the Estimation of a Dynamic Effective Reproduction Number (Dynamic-R) in the CoViD-19 Outbreak,"The CoViD-19 outbreak has escalated to a pandemic in the last few weeks, with no signs of stopping. Pharmaceutical solutions based upon virologic studies, at this point, remain inconclusive. In contrast, this paper looks towards epidemiological models during this phase of viral growth, in particular, by providing a responsive, timely model of the R value based on the previous few days' results. Such an R value, although bearing less statistical precision due to limited sampling, could allow R to become a more effective, responsive standalone measure of infectious transmission. It demonstrates that the R value can be used as a dynamic, time-dependent indicator without the use of curve-fitting, and also estimates the most recent R-value of the CoViD-19 outbreak to be about 4.29, based on the data from the previous 3 days.","Chong, Y.

1441,Higher severity and mortality in male patients with COVID-19 independent of age and susceptibility,"Importance: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Disease (COVID-19) has put the world on alert, that is reminiscent of the SARS outbreak seventeen years ago. Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age ([&ge;]65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS. Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.","Jin, J.-M.; Bai, P.; He, W.; Liu, S.; Wu, F.; Liu, X.-F.; Han, D.-M.; Yang, J.-K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026864v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026864v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1442,Temperature significant change COVID-19 Transmission in 429 cities,"Background There is no evidence supporting that temperature changes COVID-19 transmission. Methods We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. Results There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72 and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70 and 12.42 respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1 increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1 increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. Conclusion The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.","Wang, M.; Jiang, A.; Gong, L.; Luo, L.; Guo, W.; Li, C.; Zheng, J.; Li, C.; Yang, B.; Zeng, J.; Chen, Y.; Zheng, K.; Li, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025791v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025791v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True

1444,A Peptide-based Magnetic Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassay for Serological Diagnosis of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"A respiratory illness has been spreading rapidly in China, since its outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province in December 2019. The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively.

1446,Can routine laboratory tests discriminate 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia from other community-acquired pneumonia?,"Background. The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses.","Pan, Y.; Ye, G.; Zeng, X.; Liu, G.; Zeng, X.; Jiang, X.; Zhao, J.; Chen, L.; Guo, S.; Deng, Q.; Hong, X.; Yang, Y.; Li, Y.; Wang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20024711v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.20024711v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1447,"Clinical characteristics of 25 death cases infected with COVID-19 pneumonia: a retrospective review of medical records in a single medical center, Wuhan, China","Summary Background The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious disease, which was occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of February 13, 2020, a total of 59883 cases of COVID-19 in China have been confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Findings The mean age of the dead was 71.48 years, the average course of the disease was 10.56 days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients' last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22 patients (22/25, 88%). Most patients' PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages were 90.5% (19/21), 85% (19/20) and 100% (21/21) respectively. The levels of the last test of neutrophils (15/16, 93.8%), PCT (11/11, 100%), CRP (11/13, 84.6%), cTnI (8/9, 88.9%), D-Dimer (11/12, 91.6%) and LDH (9/9, 100%) were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (14/16, 87.5%). Interpretation The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.","Li, X.; Wang, L.; Yan, S.; Yang, F.; Xiang, L.; Zhu, J.; Shen, B.; Gong, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025239v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025239v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1448,SARS-CoV-2 transmission in cancer patients of a tertiary hospital in Wuhan,"In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia known as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. This new type of pneumonia is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Among the different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and the majority of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive. This prompts us to consider if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yu, J.; Ouyang, W.; Chua, M. L.

We report the laboratory results of conjunctival PCR-tests and some clinical features of these patients in shenyang China. Design: This is a cross-sectional non-randomized study. Subjects: The study include 14 confirmly diagnosed cases, 16 suspected cases and some medical observed patients. Methods: All patients with diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 were admitted to a designated hospital in Shenyang,China. We collected conjunctival samples of these patients to do the laboratory tests by real time RT-PCR.Medical observed patients were enrolled if they had clinical symptoms. Then we analysed the PCR results and clinical data from eletronic medical records in order to find some relationships. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical condition and PCR results of conjunctival swabs compared with other specimens. Results: One of the identified case coverted from suspected case without typical clinical symptoms. Twenty-two medical observed cases were removed because none of them converted to identified cases.One of the suspected converted to identified case recently.The included cases in our study are imported cases with less underlying diseases and the severity of their infection was relatively moderate. All the conjunctival results of PCR-test were negative. Two cases had typical clinical symptoms but were finally confirmed by repeated pharynx swab tests. Conclusion: Conjunctiva may be a transmission way of COVID-19.

Compared with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way. The mortality rates of COVID-19 were 2.5%, and the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of COVID-19 was 3.9%. We also found that the pathological features of COVID-19 have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as ARDS. But the latest pathological examination of COVID-19 revealed the obvious mucinous secretions in the lungs. Interpretation: The clinical and pathological characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in China are very similar, but also difference. The latest finds of pathological examination on COVID-19 may upend existing treatment schemes, so the early recognition of disease by healthcare worker is very important.","yaqian, m.; Lin, W.; Wen, J.; Chen, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025601v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025601v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1452,Applying chemical reaction transition theory to predict the latent transmission dynamics of coronavirus outbreak in China,The recent outbreak of the Covid-19 suggests a rather long latent phase that precludes public health officials to predict the pandemic transmission on time. Here we apply mass action laws and chemical transition theory to propose a kinetic model that accounts for viral transmission dynamics at the latent phase. This model is useful for authorities to make early preventions and control measurements that stop the spread of a deadly new virus.,"Xu, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026815v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20026815v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1453,"Clinical features and laboratory inspection of novelcoronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in Xiangyang, Hubei","Background: Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) rapidly spread in China, reached multiple continents currently.We aimed to reveal the infectious characteristics of COVID-19 that provide more information for the research of novel coronavirus. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics of 128 COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed from Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad during January 2020 to 16 February 2020. Results: Female patients account for 53.1%. The aged below 20 years that accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were accounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all severe groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P < 0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were common clinical symptoms. The rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range of overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P < 0.01). Lymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in the normal range of overall patients, but its were elevated in the severe group. Creatinine (CR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of overall patients in the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of all patients were increased markedly, but it in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group ( P < 0.01 ). Conclusions: Our data provide more information that advanced age, lower lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function.","Cao, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026963v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026963v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1454,Estimation of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality - preliminary results,"Since late December 2019 a new epidemic outbreak has emerged from Whuhan, China. Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated.","Caramelo, F.; Ferreira, N.; Oliveiros, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1455,Estimation of COVID-2019 burden and potential for international dissemination of infection from Iran,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and continues to spread globally, with exported cases confirmed in 28 countries at the time of writing. During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19. We sought to estimate COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next. We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data. We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada. Time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to Iran derived from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination country rankings on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing. Results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in Syria, Azerbaijan and Iraq. Even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the ""best case"" outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts. Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics.","Tuite, A.

1457,Deep learning Enables Accurate Diagnosis of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) with CT images,"Background A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged recently as an acute respiratory syndrome. The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. Materials and Methods We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system (DeepPneumonia) was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. Results The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from others with an excellent AUC of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. In addition, our model was capable of discriminating the COVID-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. Moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. The diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on Tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously. An online server is available for online diagnoses with CT images by http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/server/Ncov2019. Conclusions The established models can achieve a rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 in human samples, thereby allowing identification of patients.","Song, Y.; Zheng, S.; Li, L.; Zhang, X.; Zhang, X.; Huang, Z.; Chen, J.; Zhao, H.; Jie, Y.; Wang, R.; Chong, Y.; Shen, J.; Zha, Y.; Yang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026930v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026930v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1458,"Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, February 2020","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that spread widely in China since December 2019 is now generating local transmission in multiple countries including Singapore as of March 5, 2020. This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.0 around February 6-12, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of March 5, 2020, our most recent estimate of Rt is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7,1.0) while an estimate of the overall R based on cluster size distribution is at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0). The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscore the significant effects of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","Tariq, A.; Lee, Y.; Roosa, K.; Blumberg, S.; Yan, P.; MA, S.; Chowell, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1459,Trends in Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-infected Pneumonia in Wuhan and 29 Provinces in China,"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (COVID- 19) represents a significant public health threat. The COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. Method: Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R_t) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. Findings: We estimated that R_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan. Interpretation: Public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested that COVID- 19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.

1460,"Lessons learnt from 288 COVID-19 international cases: importations over time, effect of interventions, underdetection of imported cases","288 cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.","Pinotti, F.; Di Domenico, L.; Ortega, E.; Mancastroppa, M.; Pullano, G.; Valdano, E.; Boelle, P.-Y.; Poletto, C.; Colizza, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027326v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027326v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1461,"Estimating the serial interval of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A statistical analysis using the public data in Hong Kong from January 16 to February 15, 2020","Backgrounds: The emerging virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a large outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China since December 2019. Based on the publicly available surveillance data, we identified 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong and estimated the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19. Methods: Index cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit a Gamma distribution function to govern the SI of COVID-19. Findings: Assuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9-6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8-5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong. Conclusion: The SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.","Zhao, S.; Gao, D.; Zhuang, Z.; Chong, M.; Cai, Y.; Ran, J.; Cao, P.; Wang, K.; Lou, Y.; Wang, W.; Yang, L.; He, D.; Wang, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026559v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026559v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1462,"Intrinsic growth rules of patients infected, dead and cured with 2019 novel coronavirus in mainland China","Background An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to other regions. It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020. Methods We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. Results The feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (R-square>0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces. By comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both COVID-19 and SARS. While all three population groups of SARS are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19. Conclusions Our model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland China very well. Despite the virus caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different. The duration of the outbreak would be shorter for COVID-19.","Han, C.; Liu, Y.; Yang, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20024802v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20024802v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True
1463,Characterizing the transmission and identifying the control strategy for COVID-19 through epidemiological modeling,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originating from Wuhan, China in early December, has infected more than 70,000 people in China and other countries and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach.

However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","Ma, Y.; Diao, B.; Lv, X.; Zhu, J.; Liang, W.; Liu, L.; Bu, W.; Cheng, H.; Zhang, S.; Shi, M.; Ding, G.; Shen, B.; Wang, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201v1?rss=1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,,True

1466,Rapid colorimetric detection of COVID-19 coronavirus using a reverse tran-scriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) diagnostic plat-form: iLACO,"The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples.

1467,Rapid Detection of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification,"Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.","Lamb, L. E.; Bartolone, S.

1468,Cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoproteins and insights into coronavirus evolution,"A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% identity) to that of bat -coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 [A] and 2.83 [A] resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of -, {beta}-, {gamma}-, and {delta}-coronavirus spikes. The results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV and {beta}-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses.","Yu, J.; Qiao, S.; Guo, R.; Wang, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.961912v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.961912v1?rss=1,2020-02-24,2020-02-24,,False
1469,The efficacy of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza,"Background. Administration of convalescent plasma may be of clinical benefit for treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections. However, no clear evidence exists to support or oppose convalescent plasma use in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza. Methods. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against the eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken. The primary outcome was case fatality rates by influenza. Results. We identified 5 RCTs of severe influenza. The pooled analyses showed no evidence for a reduction in mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.06; p = 0.87; I2 = 35%). We also found non significant reductions in days in ICU and hospital, and days on mechanical ventilation. There seemed to have a biological benefit of increasing HAI titer levels and decreasing influenza B virus loads and cytokines after convalescent plasma treatment. No serious adverse events was reported between two groups. Studies were commonly of low risk of bias with high quality. Conclusions. Convalescent plasma appears safe but may not reduce mortality in severe influenza. This therapy should be studied within the context of a well designed clinical trial for treatment of SARS Cov 2 infection.","Xu, Z.; Zhou, J.; Huang, Y.; Liu, X.; Xu, Y.; Chen, S.; Liu, D.; Lin, Z.; Liu, X.; Li, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025593v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025593v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True
1470,Clinical characteristics of 51 patients discharged from hospital with COVID-19 in Chongqing，China,"Abstract BackgroundSince December 2019, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2)-infected disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan , Chinaand rapidly spread throughout Chinaeven throughout the world. We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in non-Wuhan areaand explore its effective treatment. MethodsRetrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing, China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020The discharge time was from January 29 to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51 patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients). Results Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43(84.3%)patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhanand 4(7.7%) patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4(7.7%) patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%])Local consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])all of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%])most of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P <0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13). ConclusionIn 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and astheniaSome patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease.

1472,"SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause acute renal injury: an analysis of 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a single hospital, Wuhan, China","Summary Background Whether the patients with COVID-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute renal function damage is a problem worthy of clinical attention. This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19. Beside the treatment of COVID-19, CRRT was also applied three times weekly. The course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of CRF, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CRF were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF. Interpretation Acute renal impairment was uncommon in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious acute renal injury, or aggravate CRF in the COVID-19 patients.","Wang, L.; Li, X.; Chen, H.; Yan, S.; Li, Y.; Li, D.; Gong, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025288v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025288v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True

The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics. Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens. CRISPR-nCoV demonstrated a near single-copy sensitivity and great clinical sensitivity with a shorter turn-around time than RT-PCR.

Methods We included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 peoples hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed. Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.

1475,Early Prediction of Disease Progression in 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Patients Outside Wuhan with CT and Clinical Characteristics,"Objective: To determine the predictive value of CT and clinical characteristics for short-term disease progression in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P > 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P < 0.05). Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.","Feng, Z.; Yu, Q.; Yao, S.; Luo, L.; Duan, J.; Yan, Z.; Yang, M.; Tan, H.; Ma, M.; Li, T.; Yi, D.; Mi, Z.; Zhao, H.; Jiang, Y.; He, Z.; Li, H.; Nie, W.; Liu, Y.; Zhao, J.; Luo, M.; Liu, X.; Rong, P.; Wang, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025296v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025296v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True
1476,"ACP risk grade: a simple mortality index for patients with confirmed or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) during the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan, China","Background: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, healthcare systems capacities in highly endemic areas have been overwhelmed. Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age [&ge;] 60 years and CRP [&ge;] 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age [&ge;] 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L; age < 60 years and CRP [&ge;] 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age < 60 years and CRP < 34 mg/L, 0%) (P <0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.","Lu, J.; Hu, S.; Fan, R.; Liu, Z.; Yin, X.; Wang, Q.; Lv, Q.; Cai, Z.; Li, H.; Hu, Y.; Han, Y.; Hu, H.; Gao, W.; Feng, S.; Liu, Q.; Li, H.; Sun, J.; Peng, J.; Yi, X.; Zhou, Z.; Guo, Y.; Hou, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025510v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025510v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True
1477,Evolving epidemiology of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 and possible interruption of local transmission outside Hubei Province in China: a descriptive and modeling study,"Background The COVID-19 epidemic originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in December 2019 and has spread throughout China. Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.","Zhang, J.; Litvinova, M.; Wang, W.; Wang, Y.; Deng, X.; Chen, X.; Li, M.; Zheng, W.; Yi, L.; Chen, X.; Wu, Q.; Liang, Y.; Wang, X.; Yang, J.; Sun, K.; Longini, I.

1478,Comparative study of the lymphocyte change between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases suggesting uncontrolled inflammation might not be the main reason of tissue injury,"Background: The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows unusually high transmission rate and unique clinical characteristics, with key pathological mechanism remaining unclear. Here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, in an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of COVID-19 during its infection of the human body. Methods: We analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation in COVID-19 patients, and compare these data from non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes in COVID-19 patients. Results: The study enrolled 110 patients, comprising 88 COVID-19 patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR, and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients. Conclusions: The study indicates significantly different clinical features between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-caused and non-2019-nCoV-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury. Notably, correlation analysis demonstrates that tissue damage in COVID-19 patients is attributed to virus infection itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory responses (""cytokine storm"").

1479,Effectiveness of intervention strategies for Coronavirus Disease 2019 and an estimation of its peak time,"Background: Since its first cases occurrence in Wuhan, China, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to other provinces and neighboring countries. A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread. Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.","pan, j.; yao, y.; liu, z.; li, m.; wang, y.; dong, w.; kan, h.; wang, w.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True
1480,"Association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.","Yuan, M.; Yin, W.; Tao, Z.; Tan, W.; Hu, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20024927v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.22.20024927v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True

The cumulative number of reported deaths is at 637 as of February 7, 2020. Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it ~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.","Mizumoto, K.; Chowell, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025163v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025163v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True

1484,"Clinical Characteristics of 24 Asymptomatic Infections with COVID-19 Screened among Close Contacts in Nanjing, China","Background: Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.","Hu, Z.; Song, C.; Xu, C.; Jin, G.; Chen, Y.; Xu, X.; Ma, H.; Chen, W.; Lin, Y.; Zheng, Y.; Wang, J.; hu, z.; Yi, Y.; Shen, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025619v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True
1485,Comparison of throat swabs and sputum specimens for viral nucleic acid detection in 52 cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19),"Abstract Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy. Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.","Lin, C.; Xiang, J.; Yan, M.; Li, H.; Huang, S.; Shen, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026187v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026187v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True

Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting delays.","Adiga, A.; Venkatramanan, S.; Peddireddy, A.; Telionis, A.; Dickerman, A.; Wilson, A.; Bura, A.; Warren, A.; Vullikanti, A.; Klahn, B.

1489,Profiling ACE2 expression in colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients by single-cell transcriptome analysis,"A newly identified novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused numerous acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan China from December 2019 to Feb 2020. Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets. According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV than healthy people.

Methods A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities. Findings Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p<0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p<0.001).

We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of working> 10 years (HR, 2.02; P<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (HR, 1.51; P<0.001), history of mental disorders (HR, 3.27; P<0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (HR, 1.23; P=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [OR], 0.76; P=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (OR, 0.69; P=0.004) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regressions were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people (P<0.001).

Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.","Wang, H.; Wang, Z.; Dong, Y.; Chang, R.; Xu, C.; Yu, X.; Zhang, S.; Tsamlag, L.; Shang, M.; Huang, J.; Wang, Y.; Xu, G.; Shen, T.; Zhang, X.; Cai, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024281v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024281v1?rss=1,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,,True

1498,A Note on NCP Diagnosis Number Prediction Model,"Importance: To predict the diagnosed COVID-19 patients and the trend of the epidemic in China. It may give the public some scientific information to ease the fear of the epidemic. Objective: In December 2019, pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation. Design: According to all diagnosis number from WHO website and combining with the transmission mode of infectious diseases, the mathematical model was fitted to predict future trend of outbreak. Setting: Our model was based on the epidemic situation in China, which could provide referential significance for disease prediction in other countries, and provide clues for prevention and intervention of relevant health authorities. Participants: In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020 reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We develop a simple but accurate formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:N_i/N_(i-1) =[(N_(i-1)/N_(i-2) )]^where Ni is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, and  was estimated as 0.904 at Feb 10. Results: Based on this model, it is predicted that the rate of disease infection will decrease exponentially. The total number of infected people is limited; thus, the disease will have limited impact. However, new diagnosis will last to March.

1501,"A descriptive study of the impact of diseases control and prevention on the epidemics dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai, lessons learned for metropolis epidemics prevention","Objective: To describe and evaluate the impact of diseases control and prevention on epidemics dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai. Design: A retrospective descriptive study Setting: China Participants: Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis. Main outcome measure: Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis. Results: COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where >50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died. Conclusion: Strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset.

1502,Potential T-cell and B-cell Epitopes of 2019-nCoV,"As of early March, 2019-nCoV has infected more than one hundred thousand people and claimed thousands of lives. 2019-nCoV is a novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has high similarity with SARS-CoV. No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.

Significance StatementThe novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure. We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses. Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion. Our computational pipeline is validated with experimental data from SARS-CoV.","Fast, E.; Chen, B.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.955484v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.955484v1?rss=1,2020-02-21,2020-02-21,,False
1503,A Multiscale and Comparative Model for Receptor Binding of 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the Implication of its Life Cycle in Host Cells,"The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.","Su, Z.; Wu, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.958272v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.958272v1?rss=1,2020-02-21,2020-02-21,,False

1505,Vulnerabilities in coronavirus glycan shields despite extensive glycosylation,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) are zoonotic pathogens with high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.","Watanabe, Y.; Berndsen, Z.

1506,"Functional pangenome analysis provides insights into the origin, function and pathways to therapy of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus","The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.","Alam, I.; Kamau, A.

1507,"The role of institutional trust in preventive and treatment-seeking behaviors during the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak among residents in Hubei, China","Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

1508,Rapid reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 using a synthetic genomics platform,"Reverse genetics has been an indispensable tool revolutionising our insights into viral pathogenesis and vaccine development. Large RNA virus genomes, such as from Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability1-3. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance we describe here allows to rapidly responding to emerging viruses as it enables the generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants - in real-time - during an outbreak.","Thao, T.

1509,Single cell RNA sequencing of 13 human tissues identify cell types and receptors of human coronaviruses,"The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted ""CellPhoneDB"" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","Qi, F.; Qian, S.; Zhang, S.; Zhang, Z.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.951913v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.951913v1?rss=1,2020-02-21,2020-02-21,,False

Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019-nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.","He, J.; Tao, H.; Yan, Y.; Huang, S.-Y.; Xiao, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.952903v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.952903v1?rss=1,2020-02-21,2020-02-21,,False
1511,Estimating the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 epidemic in China,"Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China since late December 2019. Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic. Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 1 March 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. Results: As of 1 March 2020, totally 80,369 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 70.9% (95% CI: 66.8%-75.6%) during Jan 20-Feb 2, 20.2% (18.6%-22.1%) during Feb 3-14, 6.9% (6.4%-7.4%) during Feb 15-23, 1.5% (1.4%-1.6%) during Feb 24-March 1 in Hubei province, and 20.3% (17.0%-25.3%) during Jan 20-28, 1.9% (1.8%-2.1%) during Jan 29-Feb 12, 0.9% (0.8%-1.1%) during Feb 13-18, 0.4% (0.4%-0.5%) during Feb 19-March 1 in other areas of China, respectively. Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 3 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.","Wang, X.; Ma, Z.; Ning, Y.; Chen, C.; Chen, R.; Chen, Q.; Zhang, H.; Li, C.; He, Y.; Wang, T.; Tong, C.; Wu, J.; Li, Y.; Ma, H.; Zhang, S.; Zhao, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20023630v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,True

Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted.

While it's evident that the virus invades respiratory tract and transmits from human to human through airway, other viral tropisms and transmission routes remain unknown. We tested viral RNA in stool from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients using rRT-PCR. 53.42% of the patients tested positive in stool. 23.29% of the patients remained positive in feces even after the viral RNA decreased to undetectable level in respiratory tract. The viral RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia showed positive immunofluorescent staining of viral host receptor ACE2 and viral nucleocapsid protein in a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Daily intercity migration data for 367 cities in China are collected from Baidu Migration, a mobile-app based human migration tracking data system. Historical data of infected, recovered and death cases from official source are used for model fitting. The set of model parameters obtained from best data fitting using a constrained nonlinear optimization procedure is used for estimation of the dynamics of epidemic spreading in the coming weeks. Our results show that the number of infections in most cities in China will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively.","Zhan, C.; Tse, C.

1515,Aberrant pathogenic GM-CSF+ T cells and inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes in severe pulmonary syndrome patients of a new coronavirus,"Pathogenic human coronavirus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), cause high morbidity and mortality 1,2. Recently, a severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was reported at December 2019 (2019-nCoV) in the city Wuhan, Hubei province, China3-5, which was also named as pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome (PARS)6. Up to 9th of February 2020, at least 37, 251 cases have been reported with 812 fatal cases according to the report from China CDC. However, the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from patients of 2019-nCoV is still unknown. Here we show that after the 2019-nCoV infection, CD4+T lymphocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. The cytokines environment induces inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerates the inflammation. These aberrant and excessive immune cells may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality. Our results demonstrate that excessive non-effective host immune responses by pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may associate with severe lung pathology. Therefore, we suggest that monoclonal antibody that targets the GM-CSF or interleukin 6 receptor may potentially curb immunopathology caused by 2019-nCoV and consequently win more time for virus clearance.","Zhou, Y.; Fu, B.; Zheng, X.; Wang, D.; Zhao, C.; Qi, Y.; Sun, R.; Tian, Z.; Xu, X.; Wei, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.945576v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.945576v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,False
1516,Tracking and Predicting COVID-19 Epidemic in China Mainland,"By proposing a varying coefficient Susceptible-Infected-Removal model (vSIR), we track the epidemic of COVID-19 in 30 provinces in China and 15 cities in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.","Sun, H.; Qiu, Y.; Yan, H.; Huang, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Chen, S.

1517,Kidney impairment is associated with in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients,"Background: Information on kidney impairment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count. Conclusion: The prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. After adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment indicators were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death.

1518,Estimating the cure rate and case fatality rate of the ongoing epidemic COVID-19,"The epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 in Wuhan at the end of 2019 has become an urgent public event of worldwide concern. However, due to the changing data of the epidemic, there is no scientific estimate of the cure rate and case fatality rate of the epidemic. This study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of COVID-19. The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic.","Diao, Y.; Liu, X.; Wang, T.; Zeng, X.; Dong, C.; Zhou, C.; Zhang, Y.; She, X.; Liu, D.; Hu, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024513v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024513v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,True
1519,"Psychological responses, behavioral changes and public perceptions during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a population based cross-sectional survey","Objective: To investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their associations with public perceptions in China Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020 Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan) Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18 Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out). Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score [&ge;]10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3).

1520,Estimation of the epidemic properties of the 2019 novel coronavirus: A mathematical modeling study,"Background The 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has been spreading rapidly in China. Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. Interpretation COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.","Li, J.; Wang, Y.; Gilmour, S.; Wang, M.; Yoneoka, D.; Wang, Y.; You, X.; Gu, J.; Hao, C.; Peng, L.; Du, Z.; Xu, D.

1521,Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"BACKGROUND The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great threat to human health, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients ([&ge;]60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/L, 300/L, or 400/L, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/L, 300/L, and 400/L, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","Diao, B.; Wang, C.; Tan, Y.; Chen, X.; Liu, Y.; Ning, L.; Chen, L.; Li, M.; Liu, Y.; Wang, G.; Yuan, Z.; Feng, Z.; Wu, Y.; Chen, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,True
1522,Association of Population Migration and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic Control,"Background and Objective To analyze the impact of different patterns of migration flow in two cities, Hefei and Shenzhen, on the epidemic and disease control of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), in order to provide insight for making differentiated controlling policies. Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4{+/-}15.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15{+/-}17.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.","Ding, Y.; Luo, S.; Zheng, X.; Ling, P.; Yue, T.; Liu, Z.; Weng, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024661v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024661v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,True
1523,Fractal kinetics of COVID-19 pandemic,"We give an update to the original paper posted on 2/17/20 -- now (as of 3/1/20) the China deaths are rapidly decreasing, and we find an exponential decline to the power law similar to the that predicted by the network model of citet{vazquez_polynomial_2006}. At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate. (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.","Ziff, R. M.; Ziff, A.

1524,Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents  = 2.1 {+/-} 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","Maier, B.

1525,Clinical Characteristics and Progression of 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Patients Concurrent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19. Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined. Results: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS. Conclusions: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.","Liu, Y.; Sun, W.; Chen, L.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, L.; Yu, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024166v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024166v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,True

We use the observed data reported in CCDC's paper to estimate distribution of the generation interval of the infection and apply the simulation results from the time delay dynamic system as well as released data from CCDC to fit the growth rate. The conclusion is: Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is larger than the growth rate 0.1 estimated by CCDC {9}, and the reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25[&le;] R0 [&le;]3.4 if we simply use R=1+r*Tc with Tc=7.5, which is bigger than that of SARS.

1527,"Estimating number of global importations of COVID-19 from Wuhan, risk of transmission outside mainland China and COVID-19 introduction index between countries outside mainland China","Background The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.","Sun, H.; Dickens, B.

1528,Mucin 4 Protects Female Mice from Coronavirus Pathogenesis,"Using incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC), a murine genetic reference population, we previously identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with low SARS-CoV titer. In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.

ImportanceGiven the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.","Plante, J.

We found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the occurrence of 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus (named as Pangolin-CoV) from dead Malayan Pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 2019-nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin-CoV is the lowest common ancestor of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV but four amino-acid mutations occur in RaTG13. It indicates Pangolin-CoV has similar pathogenic potential to 2019-nCoV, and would be helpful to trace the origin and probable intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.","Zhang, Z.; Wu, Q.; Zhang, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.950253v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.950253v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,False
1530,Structural basis for the recognition of the 2019-nCoV by human ACE2,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that is causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) to engage ACE2. We most recently determined the structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9 [A] in the presence of B0AT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5 [A], allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor. Similar to that for the SARS-CoV, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. Pairwise comparison reveals a number of variations that may determine the different affinities between ACE2 and the RBDs from these two related viruses.","Yan, R.; Zhang, Y.; Guo, Y.; Xia, L.; Zhou, Q.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.956946v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.956946v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,False

We determined the crystal structure of the unliganded Mpro at 1.75 [A] resolution and used this structure to guide optimization of a series of alpha-ketoamide inhibitors. The main goal of the optimization efforts was improvement of the pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds. We further describe 1.95- and 2.20-[A] crystal structures of the complex between the enzyme and the most potent alpha-ketoamide optimized this way. These structures will form the basis for further development of these compounds to antiviral drugs.","Zhang, L.; Lin, D.; Sun, X.; Rox, K.; Hilgenfeld, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.952879v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.952879v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,False
1532,"Structure, function and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein","The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus associated with an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia (Covid-2019) resulted in infections of more than 72,000 people and claimed over 1,800 lives. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein trimers promote entry into cells and are the main target of the humoral immune response. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 S mediates entry in VeroE6 cells and in BHK cells transiently transfected with human ACE2, establishing ACE2 as a functional receptor for this novel coronavirus. We further demonstrate that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, which correlates with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and other SARS-related CoVs. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, demonstrating spontaneous opening of the receptor-binding domain, and providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal sera potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into target cells, thereby indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.","Walls, A.

To better understand the initial step of infection at atomic-level, we determined the crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound with the cell receptor ACE2 at 2.45 [A] resolution. The overall ACE2-binding mode of the 2019-nCoV RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor. Structural analysis identified residues in 2019-nCoV RBD critical for ACE2 binding, and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for a convergent evolution between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBD for improved binding to ACE2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineages in the betacoronavirus genus. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies targeting the RBD are also analyzed with the 2019-nCoV RBD, providing insights into future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.","Lan, J.; Ge, J.; Yu, J.; Shan, S.; Zhou, H.; Fan, S.; Zhang, Q.; Shi, X.; Wang, Q.; Zhang, L.; Wang, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.956235v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.956235v1?rss=1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,,False
1534,Isolation and Characterization of 2019-nCoV-like Coronavirus from Malayan Pangolins,"The outbreak of 2019-nCoV in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019 poses unprecedent public health challenges to both China and the rest world1. The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus2. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.

ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism.

Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.","Wu, K.; Zheng, J.; Chen, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023614v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023614v1?rss=1,2020-02-19,2020-02-19,,True
1543,"COVID-19 in a Designated Infectious Diseases HospitalOutside Hubei Province,China","Background A new type of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Previous investigations reported patients in Wuhan city often progressed into severe or critical and had a high mortality rate.The clinical characteristics of affected patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less well understood. Methods All confirmed COVID-19 case treated in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of these cases to better inform patient management in normal hospital settings. Results Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233(81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42(14%) had not clear epidemiological history. Only 192(64%) cases presented with fever as initial symptom. The lymphocyte count decreased in 38% patients after admission. The number (percent) of cases classified as non-severe and severe was 240(80.6%) and 58(19.4%) respectively. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) needed ICU care. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of CRP, IL-6 and ESR. The median (IRQ) duration of positive viral test were 14(10-19). Slower clearance of virus was associated with higher risk of progression to severe clinical condition. As of February 14, 2020, 66(22.1%) patients were discharged and the overall mortality rate remains 0. Conclusions In a designated hospital outside the Hubei Province, COVID-19 patients were mainly characterized by mild symptoms and could be effectively manage by properly using the existing hospital system.","Cai, Q.; Huang, D.; Ou, P.; Yu, H.; Zhu, Z.; Xia, Z.; Su, Y.; Ma, Z.; Zhang, Y.; Li, Z.; He, Q.; Fu, Y.; Liu, L.; Chen, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024018v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024018v1?rss=1,2020-02-19,2020-02-19,,True
1544,Clinical and immunologic features in severe and moderate forms of Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Background Since late December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and continued to spread throughout China and across the globe. To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF- and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-{gamma} by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-{gamma} production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.","Chen, G.; Wu, D.; Guo, W.; Cao, Y.; Huang, D.; Wang, H.; Wang, T.; Zhang, X.; Chen, H.; Yu, H.; Zhang, X.; Zhang, M.; Wu, S.; Song, J.; Chen, T.; Han, M.; Li, S.; Luo, X.; Zhao, J.; Ning, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023903v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023903v1?rss=1,2020-02-19,2020-02-19,,True
1545,Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in China by dynamical modeling,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic has attracted world- wide attention. Herein, we propose a mathematical model to analyzes this epidemic, based on a dynamic mechanism that incorporating the intrinsic impact of hidden la- tent and infectious cases on the entire process of transmission. Meanwhile, this model is validated by data correlation analysis, predicting the recent public data, and back- tracking, as well as sensitivity analysis. The dynamical model reveals the impact of various measures on the key parameters of the epidemic. According to the public data of NHCs from 01/20 to 02/09, we predict the epidemic peak and possible end time for 5 different regions. The epidemic in Beijing and Shanghai, Mainland/Hubei and Hubei/Wuhan, are expected to end before the end of February, and before mid- March respectively. The model indicates that, the outbreak in Wuhan is predicted to be ended in the early April. As a result, more effective policies and more efforts on clinical research are demanded. Moreover, through the backtracking simulation, we infer that the outbreak of the epidemic in Mainland/Hubei, Hubei/Wuhan, and Wuhan can be dated back to the end of December 2019 or the beginning of January 2020.","Peng, L.; Yang, W.; Zhang, D.; Zhuge, C.; Hong, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023465v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023465v1?rss=1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,,True
1546,Recombination and convergent evolution led to the emergence of 2019 Wuhan coronavirus,"The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, underscores the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the SARS-CoV-2 involving the RBD. As a result of this recombination event, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a similar genotype in RBD, including two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), and alleles 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts with the human ACE2 receptor. Ancestral state analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 differentiated from its most recent common ancestor with RaTG13 by accumulating a significant number of amino acid changes in the RBD. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus whereby the SARS-CoV-2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, the lineage that led to SARS-CoV-2 accumulated further, unique changes specifically in the RBD.","Patino-Galindo, J.

Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.","Jaimes, J.

1548,Identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins in southern China,"The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.","Lam, T.

1549,Single-cell Analysis of ACE2 Expression in Human Kidneys and Bladders Reveals a Potential Route of 2019-nCoV Infection,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan of China and spread to several countries worldwide within just one month. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019-nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA-Seq data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders.

Our results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system. Our findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may be due to proximal tubule cells damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury. Beyond that, laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of 2019-nCoV.","Lin, W.; Hu, L.; Zhang, Y.; Ooi, J.

1550,Structure of dimeric full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the surface receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), directly interacting with the spike glycoprotein (S protein). ACE2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing a serious epidemic in China manifested with severe respiratory syndrome. B0AT1 (SLC6A19) is a neutral amino acid transporter whose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ACE2. Here we present the 2.9 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (PDs) of ACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediates homo-dimerization. Structural modelling suggests that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.","Zhou, Q.; Yan, R.; Zhang, Y.; Li, Y.; Xia, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.951848v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.951848v1?rss=1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,,False

[Results] From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 66,492 cases of NCP were confirmed in China mainland, a total of 54,406 cases were confirmed in Hubei Province, a total of 37,914 cases were confirmed in Wuhan city. On February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of NCP in China mainland reached a maximum of 5,328. Since then, the suspected cases have shown a significant downward trend. On February 4, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has gradually decreased in China mainland since then. On February 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland increased explosively to 15,152, and then began to decline. From February 3, 2020, except for Hubei Province, In China mainland, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP has continued to decline; From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 1,523 cases of NCP deaths in China mainland, a cumulative cure of 8096 cases, and mortality and cure rate were 2.29% (1523/66492) and 12.18% (8096/66492) respectively; Starting from January 27, 2020, The spread index of NCP gradually declined, and the extinction index of NCP rose little by little from January 29, 2020. [Conclusion] Starting from February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of the NCP is gradually decrease in China mainland. From February 3, 2020, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP is continuous decline in China mainland except Hubei Province, This shows that the control of the transmission of NCP has achieved. Judged from the number of confirmed cases of NCP, controlling the outbreak in China mainland is to control the epidemic in Hubei province, and the key to controlling the outbreak in Hubei province is to control the epidemic in Wuhan city; Judging from the gradual increase in the number and cure rate of the NCP, and the gradual decline in the number of deaths and mortality, the trend of outbreak control and treatment is getting better; A decrease of the NCP spread index indicates a slowdown in the spread of the virus, but the cumulative confirmed cases is still increase, so the epidemic will continue for some time.

Methods Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and a back propagation class to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A limitation factor for the medical resource was imposed to model the infected but not quarantined. Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas. Results Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan.

1553,Analysis of meteorological conditions and prediction of epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV infection in 2020,"Objective: To investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of 2019-nCoV infection, to predict the epidemiology of the infectious disease, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease. Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.","Bu, J.; Peng, D.-D.; Xiao, H.; Yue, Q.; Han, Y.; Lin, Y.; Hu, G.; Chen, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022715v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022715v1?rss=1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,,True

Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.","ZHOU, G.; CHI, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023168v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023168v1?rss=1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,,True
1556,A new transmission route for the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus,We explore here how variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus tropism could influence epidemic spread. We use a compartmental model fit to the existing data. The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms (gut tropism) and a second propagation route (through environment) was present. For Singapore and Shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet. Adequate prevention measures taking into account both routes should be implemented.,"Danchin, A.; Ng, T. W.

The present work estimated the distribution of incubation periods of patients infected in and outside Hubei province of China. Methods: Clinical data were collected from the individual cases reported by the media as they were not fully available on the official pages of the Chinese health authorities. MLE was used to estimate the distributions of the incubation period. Results: It was found that the incubation period of patients with no travel history to Hubei was longer and more volatile.

1559,Simulating and Forecasting the Cumulative Confirmed Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China by Boltzmann Function-based Regression Analyses,"An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is hitting Wuhan City and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments, organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts.","Fu, X.; Ying, Q.; Zeng, T.; Long, T.; Wang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564v1?rss=1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,,True

Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused. Methods and findings We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%. Conclusions The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce unnecessary economic loss.","Li, X.; Zhao, X.; Lou, Y.; Sun, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023838v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023838v1?rss=1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,,True
1562,Longitudinal characteristics of lymphocyte responses and cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,"Background: The dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines profiles of patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their correlation with the disease severity remain unclear. Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. Conclusion: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.","Liu, J.; Li, S.; Liu, J.; Liang, B.; Wang, X.; Wang, H.; Li, W.; Tong, Q.; Yi, J.; Zhao, L.; Xiong, L.; Guo, C.; Tian, J.; Luo, J.; Yao, J.; Pang, R.; Shen, H.; Peng, C.; Liu, T.; Zhang, Q.; Wu, J.; Xu, L.; Lu, S.; Wang, B.; Weng, Z.; Han, C.; Zhu, H.; Zhou, R.; Zhou, H.; Chen, X.; Ye, P.; Zhu, B.; He, S.; He, Y.; Jie, S.; Wei, P.; Zhang, J.; Lu, Y.; Wang, W.; Zhang, L.; Li, L.; Zhou, F.; Wang, J.; Dittmer, U.; Lu, M.; Hu, Y.; Yang, D.; Zheng, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671v1?rss=1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,,True
1563,"Evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to 28 countries/regions with over 43,000 confirmed cases. Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.","Zhou, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023440v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.15.20023440v1?rss=1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,,True
1564,When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: a SEIR modeling analysis,"Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.","zhang, l.; wan, k.; chen, j.; lu, c.; dong, l.; wu, z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023804v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023804v1?rss=1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,,True
1565,The role of absolute humidity on transmission rates of the COVID-19 outbreak,"A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has caused over 40,000 cases worldwide to date. Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.","Luo, W.; Majumder, M.

1566,A deep learning algorithm using CT images to screen for Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19),"Background: To control the spread of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment is a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the diagnostic gold standard but it is time consuming with significant false negative results. Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we aimed to develop a deep learning method that could extract COVID-19's graphical features in order to provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods and Findings: We collected 1,065CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases (325 images) along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia (740 images). We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images that first two nucleic acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%.

1567,Impact of seasonal forcing on a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","Neher, R.

1568,A simple laboratory parameter facilitates early identification of COVID-19 patients,"The total number of COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this infection in Wuhan, China has reached 40000 and are still growing. To facilitate triage or identification of the large number of COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms in designated fever clinics, we set to identify a practical marker that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.","Li, Q.; Ding, X.; Xia, G.; Geng, Z.; Chen, F.; Wang, L.; Wang, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022830v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022830v1?rss=1,2020-02-17,2020-02-17,,True
1569,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Contact tracing is a central public health response to infectious disease outbreaks, especially in the early stages of an outbreak when specific treatments are limited. Importation of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the United Kingdom highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.","Keeling, M.

1570,Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (COVID-19),"Background Estimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. Methods Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. Results We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably. Conclusions A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.","Li, R.; Pei, S.; Chen, B.; Song, Y.; Zhang, T.; Yang, W.; Shaman, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023127v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023127v1?rss=1,2020-02-17,2020-02-17,,True

Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS. We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene. Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province.

Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86, 449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.","Anzai, A.; Kobayashi, T.; Linton, N.

1573,Estimating the Efficacy of Traffic Blockage and Quarantine for the Epidemic Caused by 2019-nCoV (COVID-19),"Background: Since the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. Method: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study, the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine. Results: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control. Conclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the eff icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead. Also, there might be a large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the quarantine should be continued for a long time until the epidemic is totally under control.","Li, D.; Liu, Q.; Liu, Z.; Gao, Z.; Zhu, J.; Yang, J.; Wang, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20022913v1?rss=1,2020-02-17,2020-02-17,,True
1574,Clinical Characteristics of 2019 Novel Infected Coronavirus Pneumonia：A Systemic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background:A Novel pneumonia associated with the 2019 coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) suddenly broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 37287 confirmed cases and 813 death case in China (Until 8th/Feb/2019) have been reported in just fortnight. Although this risky pneumonia with high infection rates and high mortality rates need to be resolved immediately, major gaps in our knowledge of clinical characters of it were still not be established. The aim of this study is to summaries and analysis the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Methods: Literature have been systematically performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, GreyNet International, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to February 8, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality, and publication bias was analyzed by Egger test. In the single-arm meta-analysis, A fix-effects model was used to obtain a pooled incidence rate. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic region and research scale. Results: A total of nine studies including 356 patients were included in this study, the mean age was 52.4 years and 221 (62.1%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of symptoms as follows: pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), diarrhea (9.2%, 95% CI: 0.062-0.133) and headache (8.9%, 95% CI: 0.063-0.125). Meanwhile, 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) of patients were found without any symptoms although they were diagnosed by RT-PCR. In the terms of CT imaging examination, the most of patients showed bilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, 8.6% (95% CI: 0.048-0.148) of patients with crazy-paving pattern, and 11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197) of patients without obvious CT imaging presentations. The pooled incidence of mortality was 8.9% (95% CI: 0.062-0.126).

1575,Cryo-EM Structure of the 2019-nCoV Spike in the Prefusion Conformation,"The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (2019-nCov) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 [A]-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs. The atomic-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.","Wrapp, D.; Wang, N.; Corbett, K. S.; Goldsmith, J.

1576,A spatial model of CoVID-19 transmission in England and Wales: early spread and peak timing,"Background: An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.","Danon, L.; Brooks-Pollock, E.; Bailey, M.; Keeling, M.

However, the swiftly spreading virus also caused an unprecedentedly rapid response from the research community facing the unknown health challenge of potentially enormous proportions. Unfortunately, the experimental research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the viral infection and to design a vaccine or antivirals is costly and takes months to develop. To expedite the advancement of our knowledge we leverage the data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public databases, and integrate these data into a single computational pipeline. As a result, we provide a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of 2019-nCoV and use these information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS coronavirus.

1578,Estimating underdetection of internationally imported COVID-19 cases,"Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore's capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.","De Salazar, P.

1579,Identification of a pangolin niche for a 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus through an extensive meta-metagenomic search,"In numerous instances, tracking the biological significance of a nucleic acid sequence can be augmented through the identification of environmental niches in which the sequence of interest is present. Many metagenomic datasets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic dataset can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such datasets are less accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-meta-genomic approach, examining close matches to the Wuhan coronavirus 2019-nCoV in all high-throughput sequencing datasets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the keyword ""virome"". In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions of the 2019-nCoV sequence (F. Wu et al. 2020, Nature, doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3; P. Zhou et al. 2020, Nature, doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7), we note a strong homology to numerous sequence reads in a metavirome dataset generated from the lungs of deceased Pangolins reported by Liu et al. (Viruses 11:11, 2019, http://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979).

1581,Long-Term Persistence of IgG Antibodies in SARS-CoV Infected Healthcare Workers,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. METHODS: A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen. RESULTS: Anti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015. Patients treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those without. CONCLUSIONS: IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS-CoV IgG might provide protection against SARS-CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV.","Guo, X.; Guo, Z.; Duan, C.; chen, Z.; Wang, G.; Lu, Y.; Li, M.; Lu, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021386v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021386v1?rss=1,2020-02-14,2020-02-14,,True

1583,Epidemic size of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in the Epicenter Wuhan: using data of five-countries' evacuation action,"Background: Since late December 2019, novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries' government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan's NCP incidence estimation. Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation. Results: From Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020, 1916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. The infection rate is estimated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model. We then estimated that almost 110,000 (95% CI: 40,000-310,000) people were infected with 2019-nCov in Wuhan around Feb 2, 2020, assuming the infection risk of evacuees is close to Chinese citizens in Wuhan. Conclusions: At the beginning of the outbreak, incidence of NCP may be vastly underestimated. Our result emphasizes that 2019-nCov has proposed a huge public health threats in Wuhan. We need to respond more rapidly, take large-scale public health interventions and draconian measures to limiting population mobility and control the epidemic.","Zhao, H.; Man, S.; Wang, B.; Ning, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022285v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022285v1?rss=1,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,,True
1584,Serial interval of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections,"Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs. Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.","Nishiura, H.; Linton, N.

1585,ACE2 Expression in Kidney and Testis May Cause Kidney and Testis Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection,"In December 2019 and January 2020, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, and has already posed a serious threat to public health. ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.","Fan, C.; Li, K.; Ding, Y.; Lu, W.

1586,Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2,"Background: We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.","Clifford, S.

1587,Statistics based predictions of coronavirus 2019-nCoV spreading in mainland China,"Background. The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented. Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time. Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted.

1588,Clinical diagnosis of 8274 samples with 2019-novel coronavirus in Wuhan,"Background: 2019-Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreaks create challenges for hospital laboratories because thousands of samples must be evaluated each day. Sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. The possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections. Methods: We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV. Findings: Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202). Interpretation: Clinical testing methods for 2019-nCoV require improvement. Importantly, 5.8% of 2019-nCoV infected and 18.4% of non-2019-nCoV-infected patients had other pathogen infections. It is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. A test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed.","Wang, M.; Wu, Q.; Xu, W.; Qiao, B.; Wang, J.; Zheng, H.; Jiang, S.; Mei, J.; Wu, Z.; Deng, Y.; Zhou, F.; Wu, W.; Zhang, Y.; Lv, Z.; Huang, J.; Guo, X.; Feng, L.; Xia, Z.; Li, D.; Xu, Z.; Liu, T.; Zhang, P.; Tong, Y.; Li, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327v1?rss=1,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,,True

1590,"Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue","A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus.","WU, C.; Zheng, S.; Chen, Y.; Zheng, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022228v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022228v1?rss=1,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,,True

No specific treatment for this infection is currently available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, via specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against 2019-nCoV virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the entrance of 2019-nCoV-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an IC50 of 1.66 M. Although the inhibitory effect upon the replication of wildtype viruses ex vivo and in vivo remains to be determined, our preliminary result indicates that the potential antiviral activity of teicoplanin could be applied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV virus infection.","Zhang, J.; Ma, X.; Yu, F.; Liu, J.; Zou, F.; Pan, T.; Zhang, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.935387v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.935387v1?rss=1,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,,False
1592,Evidence of recombination in coronaviruses implicating pangolin origins of nCoV-2019,"A novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) was the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. Genomic analyses of nCoV-2019 determined a 96% resemblance with a coronavirus isolated from a bat in 2013 (RaTG13); however, the receptor binding motif (RBM) of these two genomes share low sequence similarity. This divergence suggests a possible alternative source for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019.

1593,"Data-Based Analysis, Modelling and Forecasting of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ~4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ~3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ~2.6 based on confirmed cases and ~2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around 0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.","Anastassopoulou, C.; Russo, L.; Tsakris, A.; Siettos, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186v1?rss=1,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,,True
1594,"Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan City: China, 2019-2020","Background: Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China, causing multiple introductions in 109 countries/territories/areas as of March 10th. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. Methods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. Results: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08-0.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19% Conclusions: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.","Mizumoto, K.; Kagaya, K.; Chowell, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1?rss=1,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,,True

The possible transmission of 2019-nCoV by conjunctiva is controversial and has substantial public health implications. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was initiated to investigate the possible transmission of 2019-nCoV through aerosol contact with conjunctiva. We enrolled 67 cases of confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) during 17-28 Jan 2020. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for real time RT-PCR analysis to detect 2019-nCoV. Results: 63 patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed NCP and the remaining four were suspected NCP. Conjunctival swab samples from one NCP patient yielded positive PCR results and two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results. None of the three patients had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019-nCoV test. Conjunctival swab samples from the four suspected cases of NCIP were negative. Conclusion: 2019-nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with NCP. Through clinical analysis, viral transmission via the conjunctival route was not supported by the data. Good clinical protection can effectively cut off the transmission path.","Zhou, Y.; Zeng, Y.; Tong, Y.; Chen, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956v1?rss=1,2020-02-12,2020-02-12,,True

Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed. Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6 and IL-10. Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for predicting the transition from mild to severe.

1599,"Distribution of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic and Correlation with Population Emigration from Wuhan, China","BACKGROUNDS: The ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.","Chen, Z.; Zhang, Q.; Lu, Y.; Zhang, X.; Zhang, W.; Guo, C.; Liao, C.; Li, Q.; Han, X.; Lu, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021824v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021824v1?rss=1,2020-02-12,2020-02-12,,True
1600,Caution on Kidney Dysfunctions of 2019-nCoV Patients,"Summary Background: To date, large amounts of epidemiological and case study data have been available for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which suggested that the mortality was related to not just respiratory complications. Here, we specifically analyzed kidney functions in COVID-19 patients and their relations to mortality. Methods: In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we included 193 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 hospitals in Wuhan, 1 hospital in Huangshi (Hubei province, 83 km from Wuhan) and 1 hospital in Chongqing (754 km from Wuhan). Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected, including data regarding to kidney functions. Data were compared among three groups: non-severe COVID-19 patients (128), severe COVID-19 patients (65) and a control group of other pneumonia (28). For the data from computed tomographic (CT) scans, we also included a control group of healthy subjects (110 cases, without abnormalities in the lung and without kidney diseases). The primary outcome was a common presence of kidney dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a fraction of COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included a survival analysis of COVID-19 patients in conditions of AKI or comorbid chronic illnesses. Findings: We included 193 COVID-19 patients (128 non-severe, 65 severe (including 32 non-survivors), between January 6th and February 21th,2020; the final date of follow-up was March 4th, 2020) and 28 patients of other pneumonia (15 of viral pneumonia, 13 of mycoplasma pneumonia) before the COVID-19 outbreak. On hospital admission, a remarkable fraction of patients had signs of kidney dysfunctions, including 59% with proteinuria, 44% with hematuria, 14% with increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, and 10% with increased levels of serum creatinine, although mild but worse than that in cases with other pneumonia. While these kidney dysfunctions might not be readily diagnosed as AKI at admission, over the progress during hospitalization they could be gradually worsened and diagnosed as AKI. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, uric acid as well as D-dimer were significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients respectively. Importantly, the Cox regression analysis also suggested that COVID-19 patients that developed AKI had a ~5.3-times mortality risk of those without AKI, much higher than that of comorbid chronic illnesses (~1.5 times risk of those without comorbid chronic illnesses). Interpretation: To prevent fatality in such conditions, we suggested a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the past disease history. In addition, upon day-by-day monitoring, clinicians should consider any potential interventions to protect kidney functions at the early stage of the disease and renal replacement therapies in severely ill patients, particularly for those with strong inflammatory reactions or a cytokine storm.

In this study, we investigated the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and to form linear antibody epitopes. We created an online database to broadly share the predictions as a resource for the research community. Using this resource, we showed that genetic variations in SARS- CoV-2, though still few for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus. Importantly, we discovered evidence that SARS-CoV-2, along with related coronaviruses, used mutations to evade attack from the human immune system.

Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated. Objective: To estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs. Design: We proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey. Setting: We estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province.

Exposures for observational studies: The daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan.

1605,Facemask shortage and the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak: Reflection on public health measures,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask shortage during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.","Wu, H.; Huang, J.; Zhang, C.

We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence. Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age [&ge;] 50 and NLR < 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age [&ge;] 50 and NLR [&ge;] 3.13 would develop severe illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR with age, the study developed a 2019-nCoV pneumonia management process. Conclusions: The NLR was the early identification of risk factors for 2019-nCoV severe illness.

1607,Simulating the infected population and spread trend of 2019-nCov under different policy by EIR model,"Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.","Xiong, H.; Yan, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021519v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021519v1?rss=1,2020-02-12,2020-02-12,,True
1608,Beyond R0: the importance of contact tracing when predicting epidemics,"The basic reproductive number --- R0 --- is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Nevertheless, estimating R0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R0. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R0) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R0 when predicting epidemic size.","Hebert-Dufresne, L.; Althouse, B.

Methods: Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected [&ge;] 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected [&ge;] 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples. Interpretation: Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP.

However, the clinical symptoms varied in different reports. Based on the results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.","Liang, W.; Rao, S.; Xiao, C.; Lin, Z.; Zhang, Q.; Qi, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020289v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020289v1?rss=1,2020-02-11,2020-02-11,,True

1614,Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Background: To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.","Hellewell, J.; Abbott, S.; Gimma, A.; Bosse, N.

In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public-health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach.

MethodSeveral techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.

ResultsExtensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.

ConclusionT cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target.

1621,The transmembrane serine protease inhibitors are potential antiviral drugs for 2019-nCoV targeting the insertion sequence-induced viral infectivity enhancement,"At the end of 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 induces an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in China1, even more spread than SARS-CoV infection2. The entry of SARS-CoV into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor (ACE2) recognition and spike protein cleavage-induced cell membrane fusion3,4. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 with a similar affinity, whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear5,6. Here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found a SPRR insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. Additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ACE2 and TMPRSSs are highly coexpressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate its potential target cells.","Meng, T.; Cao, H.; Zhang, H.; Kang, Z.; Xu, D.; Gong, H.; Wang, J.; Li, Z.; Cui, X.; Xu, H.; Wei, H.; Pan, X.; Zhu, R.; Xiao, J.; Zhou, W.; Cheng, L.; Liu, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.926006v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.926006v1?rss=1,2020-02-11,2020-02-11,,False

1623,The lockdown of Hubei Province causing different transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan and Beijing,"Background: After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. Methods and findings: We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6{+/-}10 in Wuhan and March 20{+/-}16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly. Conclusions: The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV.","Li, X.; Zhao, X.; Sun, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021477v1?rss=1,2020-02-11,2020-02-11,,True
1624,The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak,"Motivated by the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","Chinazzi, M.; Davis, J.

1626,Assessing the plausibility of subcritical transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States,"Abstract: The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread. While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.","Blumberg, S.; Lietman, T. M.; Porco, T.

1627,Estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number of 2019-nCoV Outbreak in China,"Background: The 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention. As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China. Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce the Rc to below one in order to end the current epidemic.","You, C.; Deng, Y.; Hu, W.; Sun, J.; Lin, Q.; Zhou, F.; Pang, C.

1628,EPIDEMIC TRENDS ANALYSIS AND RISK ESTIMATION OF 2019-NCOV OUTBREAK,"Since December 8, 2019, the spread of COVID-19 is increasing every day. It is particularly important to predict the trend of the epidemic for the timely adjustment of the economy and industries. We proposed a Flow-SEHIR model in this paper, based on which we further analyzed the trends of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) in China. The results show that the basic reproductive numbers R0 of COVID-19 is 3.56 (95% CI: 2.31-4.81). The number of daily confirmed new cases reaches the inflection point on Feb. 6-10 outside Hubei. For the maximum of infected cases number, the predicted peak value in China except Hubei was estimated to be 13806 (95% CI: 11926-15845). The peak arrival time is on March 3-9. The temporal number of patients in most areas of China outside Hubei will peak from March 12 to March 15. The peak values of more than 73.5% provinces or regions in China will be controlled within 1000.

1629,"Tobacco-use disparity in gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov","In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","Cai, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v1?rss=1,2020-02-11,2020-02-11,,True
1630,Spatially Explicit Modeling of 2019-nCoV Epidemic Trend based on Mobile Phone Data in Mainland China,"IAs of February 11, 2020, all prefecture-level cities in mainland China have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.","Zhu, X.; Zhang, A.; Xu, S.; Jia, P.; Tan, X.; Tian, J.; Wei, T.; Quan, Z.; Yu, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021360v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021360v1?rss=1,2020-02-11,2020-02-11,,True
1631,Alpha-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication,"The main protease of coronaviruses and the 3C protease of enteroviruses share a similar active-site architecture and a unique requirement for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate. Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic -ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease:inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the -ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC50 values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures.

1632,Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China,"Background: Since December 2019, acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.","Guan, W.-j.; Ni, Z.-y.; Hu, Y.; Liang, W.-h.; Ou, C.-q.; He, J.-x.; Liu, L.; Shan, H.; Lei, C.-l.; Hui, D.

1633,Analysis of the epidemic growth of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak using internationally confirmed cases,"Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification. Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.","Zhao, Q.; Chen, Y.; Small, D.

We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.","Cao, Z.; Zhang, Q.; Lu, X.; Pfeiffer, D.; Wang, L.; Song, H.; Pei, T.; Jia, Z.; Zeng, D.

1636,Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against introductions of 2019-nCoV,"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic has spread to 23 countries from China. Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.","Gilbert, M.; Pullano, G.; Pinotti, F.; Valdano, E.; Poletto, C.; Boelle, P.-Y.; D'Ortenzio, E.; Yazdanpanah, Y.; Eholie, S.

1637,"ACE2 expression by colonic epithelial cells is associated with viral infection, immunity and energy metabolism","Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.","Wang, J.; Zhao, S.; Liu, M.; Zhao, Z.; Xu, Y.; Wang, P.; Lin, M.; Xu, Y.; Huang, B.; Zuo, X.; Chen, Z.; Bai, F.; Cui, J.; Lew, A.

Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients. If 90% of symptomatic patients could be tested within six hours of symptoms appearing, the epidemic could be ended in under four months.","Chowell, G.; Dhillon, R.; Srikrishna, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020271v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020271v1?rss=1,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,,True
1641,Risk assessment of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoVoutbreaks outside China,"We developed a computational tool to assess the risk of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia and Europe, and we investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.","Boldog, P.; Tekeli, T.; Vizi, Z.; Denes, A.; Bartha, F.; Rost, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020503v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020503v1?rss=1,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,,True
1642,Human-to-human transmission of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"Background: On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 in humans was reported in Wuhan, and then spread fast to other provinces, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing.

1646,Forecasting the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemics using a simple (simplistic) model,"Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28, 2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth.

Our results confirm that there is a significant correlation between the export population of Wuhan and reported cases in various regions. We subsequently found that the mortality rate in Hubei Province was much higher than that in other regions of mainland China, while the investigation of potential cases in Wuhan was far behind other provinces in Mainland China, which indicates the effectiveness of early isolation.","Jin, G.; Yu, J.; Han, L.; Duan, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020438v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020438v1?rss=1,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,,True
1648,Network-based Drug Repurposing for Human Coronavirus,"Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.","Zhou, Y.; Hou, Y.; Shen, J.; Huang, Y.; Martin, W.; Cheng, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263v1?rss=1,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,,True

In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. We also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion.

Aim: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020. Methods: A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur.

1651,Specific ACE2 Expression in Cholangiocytes May Cause Liver Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection,"A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.","Chai, X.; Hu, L.; Zhang, Y.; Han, W.; Lu, Z.; Ke, A.; Zhou, J.; Shi, G.; Fang, N.; Fan, J.; Cai, J.; Fan, J.; Lan, F.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.931766v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.931766v1?rss=1,2020-02-04,2020-02-04,,False

1653,Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between Wuhan 2019-nCoV and bat Betacoronaviruses,"As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed to COVID-19) spread to 30 countries with 2130 deaths and more than 75500 confirmed cases. COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearmans rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.","Randhawa, G.

1654,Preliminary identification of potential vaccine targets for 2019-nCoV based on SARS-CoV immunological studies,"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","Ahmed, S. F.; Quadeer, A. A.; McKay, M.

1655,Machine intelligence design of 2019-nCoV drugs,"Wuhan coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by January 30, 2020. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019-nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.","Nguyen, D.

1656,Estimating the risk on outbreak spreading of 2019-nCoV in China using transportation data,"A novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China and has been causing an unprecedented outbreak in China. The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high , the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low , the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections.","Yuan, H.-Y.; Hossain, M.

1657,The incubation period of 2019-nCoV from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application,"A novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in China in December, 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period, which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Here, we use data from public reports of 101 confirmed cases in 38 provinces, regions, and countries outside of Wuhan (Hubei province, China) with identifiable exposure windows and known dates of symptom onset to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV. We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI 4.4-6.0), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Whether this risk is acceptable depends on the underlying risk of infection and consequences of missed cases. The estimates presented here can be used to inform policy in multiple contexts based on these judgments.","Lauer, S. A.; Grantz, K. H.; Bi, Q.; Jones, F. K.; Zheng, Q.; Meredith, H.; Azman, A.

1658,Early epidemiological analysis of the 2019-nCoV outbreak based on a crowdsourced data,"Abstract: As the outbreak of novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) progresses within China and beyond, there is a need for rapidly available epidemiological data to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we present an effort to compile epidemiological information on 2019-nCoV from media news reports and a physician community website (dxy.cn) between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020, as the outbreak entered its 7th week. We compiled a line list of patients reported in China and internationally and daily case counts by Chinese province. We describe the demographics, hospitalization and reporting delays for 288 patients, over time and geographically. We find a decrease in case detection lags in provinces outside of Wuhan and internationally, compared to Wuhan, and after Jan 18, 2020, as outbreak awareness increased. The rapid progression of reported cases in different provinces of China is consistent with local transmission beyond Wuhan. The age profile of cases points at a deficit among children under 15 years of age, possibly related to prior immunity with related coronavirus or behavioral differences. Overall, our datasets, which have been publicly available since Jan 21, 2020, align with official reports from Chinese authorities published more than a week later. Availability of publicly available datasets in the early stages of an outbreak is important to encourage disease modeling efforts by independent academic modeling teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.","Sun, K.; Chen, J.; Viboud, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019935v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019935v1?rss=1,2020-02-04,2020-02-04,,True
1659,Fast assessment of human receptor-binding capability of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"The outbreaks of 2002/2003 SARS, 2012/2015 MERS and 2019/2020 Wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (CoV) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.","Huang, Q.; Herrmann, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.930537v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.930537v1?rss=1,2020-02-03,2020-02-03,,False
1660,Direct Measurement of Rates of Asymptomatic Infection and Clinical Care-Seeking for Seasonal Coronavirus,"The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China, during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections. Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus. We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms.

1661,Molecular Modeling Evaluation of the Binding Abilities of Ritonavir and Lopinavir to Wuhan Pneumonia Coronavirus Proteases,"Three anti-HIV drugs, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir, might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP), were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.","Lin, S.; Shen, R.; Guo, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.929695v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.929695v1?rss=1,2020-02-03,2020-02-03,,False

Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

However, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report had suggested that novel CoV would use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro.

1666,"Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, China through a drug-target interaction deep learning model","The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.","Beck, B.

1667,Early dynamics of transmission and control of 2019-nCoV: a mathematical modelling study,"Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.","Kucharski, A.

1669,Real time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection: Inference using exported cases,"The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection who were confirmed in other countries provide a chance to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively.

Methods: The information of COVID-19 and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 853 confirmed COVID-19 patients obtained from the website of health committees of 18 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed COVID-19 case data. Results: The growth rate of new cases and deaths of COVID-19 were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 1 months to 94 years and the average age was (45.05 {+/-} 17.22) years.

As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number Ro -- the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of Ro vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate $r$, the mean generation interval $bar G$, and the generation-interval dispersion $kappa$. We then apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early Ro estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of Ro, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate Ro at the outset of an epidemic.","Park, S.

Other cities that implemented control measures pre-emptively reported 33.3% (11.1-44.4%) fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks (13.0; 7.1-18.8) compared with cities that started control later (20.6; 14.5-26.8). Among interventions investigated here, the most effective were suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings. The national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic and, by 19 February (day 50), had averted hundreds of thousands of cases across China.","Tian, H.; Li, Y.; Liu, Y.; Kraemer, M.

1673,The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor ACE2 and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for entry into target cells,"The emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, in China, and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Coronaviruses use their spike proteins to select and enter target cells and insights into nCoV-2019 spike (S)-driven entry might facilitate assessment of pandemic potential and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that 2019-nCoV-S uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor, ACE2, for entry and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for 2019-nCoV-S priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the serum form a convalescent SARS patient neutralized 2019-nCoV-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-coronavirus infection, which might translate into similar transmissibility and disease pathogenesis. Moreover, they identify a target for antiviral intervention.

Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.","Ju, J.; Kumar, S.; Li, X.; Jockusch, S.; Russo, J.

1675,Engineered unnatural ubiquitin for optimal detection of deubiquitinating enzymes,"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are responsible for removing ubiquitin (Ub) from its protein conjugates. DUBs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. Commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the C-terminal Ub motif or contain Ub coupled to a fluorophore (Z-LRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBs--MERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.","Rut, W.; Zmudzinski, M.; Snipas, S.

The same as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 2019-nCov enters into host cells via cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). In order to dissect the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion and explore a potential route of the 2019-nCov infection in digestive system infection, 4 datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, esophagus, gastric, ileum and colon were analyzed. The data showed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. These results indicated along with respiratory systems, digestive system is a potential routes for 2019-nCov infection.

Here, we analyze the expected impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss around half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.","Gostic, K.; Gomez, A. C. R.; Mummah, R.

1679,Evolution and variation of 2019-novel coronavirus,"BackgroundThe current outbreak caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has become a worldwide concern. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.

MethodsWe downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.

ResultsAn isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1{middle dot}05 x 10-2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 x 10-4 to 2.72 x 10-2) for N, 5.34 x 10-3 (5.10 x 10-4, 1.28 x 10-2) for S, 1.69 x 10-3 (3.94 x 10-4, 3.60 x 10-3) for P, 1.65 x 10-3 (4.47 x 10-4, 3.24 x 10-3) for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the epidemic.

1680,Insights into Cross-species Evolution of Novel Human Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and Defining Immune Determinants for Vaccine Development,"Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.","Ramaiah, A.; Arumugaswami, V.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.925867v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.925867v1?rss=1,2020-01-30,2020-01-30,,False

Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen. In contrast, specific inhibitors targeting the key protease involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-nCoV, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development. In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV.","Li, Y.; Zhang, J.; Wang, N.; Li, H.; Shi, Y.; Guo, G.; Liu, K.; Zeng, H.; Zou, Q.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.922922v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.922922v1?rss=1,2020-01-29,2020-01-29,,False

Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","Tian, X.; Li, C.; Huang, A.; Xia, S.; Lu, S.; Shi, Z.; Lu, L.; Jiang, S.; Yang, Z.; Wu, Y.; Ying, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011v1?rss=1,2020-01-28,2020-01-28,,False

We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to ""Disease X"" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%. Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen.

1692,Full-genome evolutionary analysis of the novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event,"BackgroundA novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.

MethodsPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.

ResultsOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.

ConclusionsThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.","Paraskevis, D.; Kostaki, E.

1693,Transmission dynamics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"RationaleSeveral studies have estimated basic production number of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear.

ObjectivesWe aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS.

MethodsData on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS.

Measurements and main resultsAs of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic.

ConclusionsNCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one.

At a Glance CommentaryO_ST_ABSScientific Knowledge on the SubjectC_ST_ABSSince December 29, 2019, pneumonia infection with 2019-nCoV, now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS.

What This Study Adds to the FieldWe compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one.","Liu, T.; Hu, J.; Kang, M.; Lin, L.; Zhong, H.; Xiao, J.; He, G.; Song, T.; Huang, Q.; Rong, Z.; Deng, A.; Zeng, W.; Tan, X.; Zeng, S.; Zhu, Z.; Li, J.; Wan, D.; Lu, J.; Deng, H.; He, J.; Ma, W.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.919787v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.919787v1?rss=1,2020-01-26,2020-01-26,,False

According to WHO report, this new coronavirus has resulted in 76,392 confirmed infections and 2,348 deaths in China by 22 February, 2020, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. SARS-CoV-2 was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-CoV. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral entry, reproduction and transmission.

1696,2019-20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak: Intense surveillance is vital for preventing sustained transmission in new locations,"The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 830 confirmed cases, including 26 deaths, as of 24 January 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to other countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005. This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a large global epidemic.","Thompson, R.

1697,"Complete genome characterisation of a novel coronavirus associated with severe human respiratory disease in Wuhan, China","Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Zika and highly pathogenic influenza present a major threat to public health1-3. Despite intense research effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12nd 2019. Epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 26th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing4 identified a novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV).

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history of genomic recombination.

Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4--3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza.

FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans.","Benvenuto, D.; Giovanetti, M.; Ciccozzi, A.; Spoto, S.; Angeletti, S.; Ciccozzi, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.915157v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.24.915157v1?rss=1,2020-01-24,2020-01-24,,False
1702,Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm,"The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of infecting people. In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.

One Sentence SummaryIt is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input. Applied to the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus, our prediction demonstrated that several vertebrate-infectious coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human.

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.

MethodsAccounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate ({gamma}), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.

FindingsThe early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0.

ConclusionThe mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and significantly larger than 1.

1706,Novel ionophores active against La Crosse virus identified through rapid antiviral screening,"Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens, causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic fevers to encephalitis. Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.

ImportanceNo antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.","Sandler, Z.

Since SARS- CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.","Letko, M.

These data are important to guide design of infection control policy and inform the public on the nature of threat imposed by 2019-nCov when results of direct laboratory tests on this virus are not expected to be available in the near future.","Dong, N.; Yang, X.; Chen, K.; Chan, E.; Yang, M.; Chen, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.913368v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.913368v1?rss=1,2020-01-21,2020-01-21,,False
1709,A mathematical model for simulating the transmission of Wuhan novel Coronavirus,"As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from a seafood market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People transmission network model. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.","Chen, T.; Rui, J.; Wang, Q.; Zhao, Z.; Cui, J.-A.; Yin, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.19.911669v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.19.911669v1?rss=1,2020-01-19,2020-01-19,,False
1710,Using text mining to track outbreak trends in global surveillance of emerging diseases: ProMED-mail,"Objectives: ProMED-mail (Program for Monitoring Emerging Disease, also abbreviated ProMED) is an international disease outbreak monitoring and early warning system. Every year, users contribute thousands of reports that include reference to infectious diseases and toxins, and these reports are then distributed to all subscribers of ProMED. However, the corpus of reports has not been well studied so far. Thus, we propose to apply text mining methods to derive information pertinent to the characterisation of the stage of an epidemic outbreak from the reports. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in ProMED reports in three steps: reports filtering, keywords extraction from reports and finally word co-occurrence network analysis. The keyword extraction was performed with the TextRank algorithm, keywords co-occurrence networks were then produced using the top keywords from each document and multiple network centrality measures were computed to analyse the co-occurrence networks. We used two major outbreaks in recent years, Ebola 2014 and Zika 2015, as cases to illustrate and validate the process. Results: We found that the information structures extracted at different stages of outbreaks from ProMED are consistent with response strategies as well as situation reports of the World Health Organisation. Conclusion: This study shows that ProMED provides large valuable information to characterise the evolution of epidemic outbreaks. Our research presents a pipeline that can extract and organise this information in a meaningful way. It also highlights the potential for ProMED mail to be utilised in monitoring, evaluating and improving responses to outbreaks.","You, J.; Expert, P.; Costelloe, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017145v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017145v1?rss=1,2020-01-13,2020-01-13,,True
1711,Coronavirus Interferon Antagonists Differentially Modulate the Host Response during Replication in Macrophages,"Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed PLP2. PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.

ImportanceCoronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","Deng, X.; Volk, A.; Chen, Y.; Kesely, K. R.; Hackbart, M.; Mettelman, R.
